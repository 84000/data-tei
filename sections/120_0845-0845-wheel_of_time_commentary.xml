                        single text which is not, strictly speaking, Buddha-word, being a treatise. The Lithang, Degé, and Urga
                        Kangyurs include this text, which in most other cases is found only in the Tengyur. </p>

                        by King Puṇḍarīka, eighth king of Shambhala and son of King Yaśas (who compiled the 
                        <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Laghutantra</title> itself, Toh 362). It was first translated into Tibetan from
                        Sanskrit in the 11th century by the Kashmiri scholar Somanātha and Sherab Trak, and later revised by
                        Zhangtön Dodé Pal, Tsultrim Dar, and Shongtön.</p>

                        highest of all mantra systems, it has been published here—just as past scholars have placed it—in order to
                        honor it as the equivalent of the Teacher’s own word.”</p>

                        Incantations, and although it appears to be intended to come right at the end of the Degé Kangyur, as its
                        final fifth chapter shares a volume with the Kangyur <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar
