                    <p tid="2">The 249 texts in this section all belong to the genre sometimes known as “incantations,” a somewhat unsatisfactory
                        translation of the Sanskrit term <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign> (Tibetan
                            <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gzungs</foreign>). This term can mean “memory” or “retention” as
                        well as designating a formulaic sequence of syllables or words (of the kind that characterizes these
                        texts) understood to have a power greater than their mere semantic content.</p>
                    <p tid="3">
                        <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Dhāraṇī</foreign> in the sense of “retention” refers to a quality
                        of mind or accomplishment said to be attained by arhats and bodhisattvas that allows them to memorize long
                        teachings and instructions, one method of so doing being to compress them into a few words or syllables
                        which then provide a key or mnemonic for their later recall. These words or syllables therefore contain
                        all the potency of the material of which they are the quintessence, and can be deployed in rituals for a
                        wide variety of purposes. Although such <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign> are often
                        taken to be of a tantric nature (and many of them are indeed of tantric origin), their use is widespread
                        in many Buddhist traditions outside any tantric influence. The term is thus distinct from the related term
                        “mantra.”</p>
                    <p tid="4">Works of this genre almost always include more than simply such a formula or set of formulae (usually in
                        Sanskrit). Typically, an introductory narrative may explain their history and the reasons for their being
                        taught, and a concluding section may describe how they should be used and what results and benefits will
                        ensue.</p>
                    <p tid="5">A total of 108 <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign> texts are listed in the early 9th
                        century Denkarma catalogue, including a set headed the “Five Great Dhāraṇīs,” a miscellaneous group of
                        103 other works, and a set of nine works centered on the recital of the 108 names of a deity or
                        bodhisattva.</p>
                    <p tid="6">The slightly later Phangthangma inventory lists the same “Five Great Dhāraṇīs,” 13 miscellaneous
                        dhāraṇī texts with rituals, a set of 89 dhāraṇī texts ranked in order of their different size, a group of
                        nine “essence” mantra-dhāraṇīs extracted from larger texts elsewhere, and a final mixed group of 34
                        texts, some with 108 names, some praises, expressions of auspiciousness, or aspiration prayers.</p>
                    <p tid="10">In most Kangyurs, works categorized as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign> are 
                        to be found in the General Sūtra section and in several subdivisions
                        of the Tantra Collection. But in addition, most Kangyurs of the Tshalpa tradition contain the texts making up the present 
                        collection either as a separate, named Compendium of Dhāraṇīs (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gzungs ’dus</foreign>), as in 
                        the Degé and Urga Kangyurs, or as a set of largely duplicated or triplicated texts in the later volumes of the tantra section, 
                        as in the Peking-Qianlong, Lithang, and Choné Kangyurs. The Narthang and Lhasa Kangyurs, along with the manuscript Kangyurs 
                        of the Themphangma tradition, do not gather these texts into a distinct set of copies.</p>
                    <p tid="11">
                        In the Degé Kangyur, almost all the works that this section contains are duplicates of works in other divisions of the
                        Kangyur. Only 13 titles in this section are unique to this part of the Kangyur: Toh 846, 862, 865, 912,
                        952, 953, 987, 1059, 1059A, 1066, 1067, 1090, and 1091. However, in some cases the version of a text reproduced here may differ slightly from 
                        copies found elsewhere in the Kangyur.</p>
                    <p tid="8">As well as works conforming to the usual structure of a <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign>, the section also includes texts containing the 108 names of the Buddha (Toh 873),
                        the Eight Bodhisattvas (Toh 874-881), Tāra (Toh 1000), and the wealth god Jambhala (Toh 972); sūtras
                        recited for ritual and protective purposes, including three of the Mahāsūtras (Toh 1061-2 and 1093); texts
                        that essentialize much longer works, whether sūtra or tantra (Toh 932-934 and 939-945); and a number of
                        praises and invocations.</p>
