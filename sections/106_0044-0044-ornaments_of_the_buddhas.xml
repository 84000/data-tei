                    <p tid="2">This very long work in forty-five chapters fills no less than four volumes of the Degé Kangyur. In its current
                        form, it is presented as a single extensive sūtra (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vaipulyasūtra</title>), but it
                        probably evolved as an encyclopedic coalescence of shorter works, many of which circulated independently
                        and are still seen as texts in their own right. The whole work is classified by Tibetan editors as
                        belonging to the Buddha’s third turning of the wheel of Dharma.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14666-4"/>
                    <p tid="3">The early ninth-century Tibetan translation is of similar size and content to the late seventh century Chinese
                        translation by Śikṣānanda, both being larger than the earlier Chinese translation by Buddhabhadra (early
                        fifth century). Chinese translations of individual works that were later incorporated into the
                        Buddhāvataṃsaka were made even earlier (late second to early fourth century), and may provide evidence of the
                        gradual evolution of the Buddhāvataṃsaka from its component parts. No version in any Indic language has
                        survived, and Indian treatises only quote some of its component texts rather than the whole work by the
                        name Buddhāvataṃsaka.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14666-5"/>
                    <p tid="4">Tibetan historical tradition, however, as recounted by Tāranātha and mentioned briefly in the Degé Kangyur
                        catalog, tells us that in India the collection not only existed but was originally a great deal larger,
                        with one hundred chapters (according to the Kangyur catalog) or one thousand (Tāranātha), but is now
                        incomplete because an arson attack on the library at Nālandā reduced it to only thirty-eight surviving
                        chapters. The date of this event, said to have been responsible for the decimation of many other
                        scriptures, too (including much of the Ratnakūṭa), is placed sometime before the lives of Asaṅga and
                        Vasubandhu, along with accounts of other calamitous episodes during a period of political turbulence and
                        unstable patronage for Buddhist institutions in India.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14666-6"/>
                    <p tid="5">The Buddhāvataṃsaka was studied far more extensively in China than in Tibet, generating an extensive corpus
                        of commentarial literature, and a whole school of Chinese Buddhism, the Huayan, is based on it. Although
                        held in great esteem in Tibet, it was very little studied as a whole, and only a few of the later chapters
                        were widely known and quoted. It was translated into Tibetan in its entirety by Jinamitra, Surendrabodhi,
                        and Yeshé Dé, almost certainly from a Sanskrit original. The Tibetan translation contains two chapters, 11
                        and 32, not found in any of the Chinese translations.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14666-7"/>
                    <p tid="6">According to Chinese tradition with its several versions, the whole work is divided into thirty-four or thirty-nine chapters,
                        grouped into eight or nine “assemblies” according to the places and occasions where the teachings they
                        relate took place.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14666-8"/>
                    <p tid="7">The way the text is divided into chapters is different in the Tibetan version. Several of the Kangyur
                        catalogs mention the first twenty-nine chapters as constituting the Buddhāvataṃsaka proper, and add various
                        alternative titles for the work such as <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sangs rgyas smag chad</title> (“the
                        buddhas’ absence of darkness”), <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">smad chad</title> or <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rmad
                            gcad</title> (“universal containment,” the latter being the form used in the first line of each
                        fascicle), as well as <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">snyan gyi gong rgyan</title> (“ornaments for the ears”) and
                        <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">padma’i rgyan</title> (“lotus ornaments”). Following both of the surviving
                        early text inventories, the Phangthangma and Denkarma, they then name a selection of the later chapters,
                        leaving ambiguous their status as texts independent of the Buddhāvataṃsaka itself or part of it. The text
                        itself gives its component parts none of the trappings of independent texts, such as Sanskrit titles or
                        the usual opening phrases. However, as some of the later chapters are known to have circulated
                        independently in India as well as in China and Tibet, it is reasonable to speak of the Buddhāvataṃsaka as
                        a “family” of texts even if little is known of how and why they came to be grouped together in this
                        way.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC14666-9"/>
                    <p tid="22">There are nevertheless some shared features. Most of the narrative elements of the texts (with the exception of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Gaṇḍavyūha</title>) take place in the few weeks following the Buddha’s awakening. As tradition holds that he did not teach during this time but remained silently in meditation, the teachings set out in the texts are given by Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, and other bodhisattvas. Another common feature is the view that all buddhas and bodhisattvas, wherever they may manifest, are emanations of the Buddha Vairocana. </p>
