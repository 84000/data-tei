                        belonging to the three main “inner tantra” categories and translated in the early, 
                        “imperial” period of translation in Tibet (i.e. the

                        among a restricted circle of tantric practitioners associated with what later came to be known as the
                        “ancient tradition of the early translations” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">snga 
                            ’gyur rnying ma</foreign>), they had not been as well documented as the large number of
                        texts of other categories (sūtra, vinaya, dhāraṇī, eulogy, treatise, commentary, etc.) that had 
                        also been translated in the imperial period.</p>

                        by many of the scholars—mostly affiliated with the “later translation” traditions—who were responsible for compiling the 
                        various early Kangyurs and Tengyurs. Their objections regarding these tantras were in marked contrast to their 
                        acceptance of the early translations of all other textual genres. The limited selection in this section comprises those few
                        tantric works that at least some later scholars (though not all) felt could be acknowledged as canonical.</p>

                          in the (varying) compilations known as the Nyingma Gyübum, the tantras in this section are at least
                          partially representative of the three main divisions of the inner tantras according to the Nyingma
                          doxography: Atiyoga, Anuyoga, and Mahāyoga.</p>

                    <p tid="4">Some hundreds of tantras are said to have been translated from Sanskrit and other
                        languages during the early, imperial period under the royal patronage of King
                        Tri Songdetsen and his successors. However, the texts of the three “inner tantra” 
                        categories were treated
                        with great secrecy, and were not listed along with the other, non-esoteric
                        texts translated at the time in official inventories such as the Denkarma 
                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>). Nor, because of their
                        perceived sanctity, were they submitted to the process of terminological and
                        orthographical standardization that took place in the early ninth century.
                        When the imperial period with its centralized patronage of Buddhist institutions and 
                        scholarship came to an end in the mid ninth century (traditionally linked to the reign of

                        during the century of rebellions and general disintegration
                        that followed, and have been maintained down to the present day. But in the
                        eleventh century a different set of tantras—those to be found in India at
                        the time—began to be introduced to Tibet by Rinchen Zangpo, Drokmi Lotsāwa,
                        Marpa Lotsāwa, and others. These formed the beginning of the “new
                        translations” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gsar ’gyur</foreign>) of the
                        “later spread” of the teachings (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">phyi
                            dar</foreign>) and became the tantric corpus of the new traditions that
                        gradually emerged and developed over the centuries that followed.</p>

                        of the times—to establish canonical collections of the Tibetan translations by cataloguing, and then compiling, 
                        works of all genres into the systematic collections that became the Kangyurs—were scholars whose 
                        allegiance was to the traditions of the new translations, and they had much less interest in the tantras of the early period.

                        partly based on reasonable doubts regarding the authenticity of the Indian sources of some of them.
                        Indeed it is no surprise that the new wave of Tibetan translators, visiting India and Nepal many
                        centuries after the early period, and largely different regions, found little evidence of the tantric
                        traditions encountered elsewhere by their forbears, and even if searching for such evidence
                        had been of greater concern for them than it actually was, they might have been unlikely 
                        to find much.</p>

                    <p tid="11149412056683">Moreover, the criteria that proponents of the later tantra translations drew up
                        to determine “authenticity” were themselves a set of parameters partly determined by the
                        dialectic between the old and new traditions itself. Although in some respects objective and 
                        scholarly, they were not designed to take full account of 
                        the rather different approaches to textual and cultural adaptation that shaped the values
                        of the earlier translations, and indeed even those of the Indian tantric communities
                        from which the tantras, old and new, had been inherited.<note place="end" xml:id="O1JC114941JC20566-122">See

                        the early translators regarding all the textual genres other than the higher tantras; their reluctance to do the same 
                        regarding this category of tantra stands out in significant contrast. Overall, it would be difficult to conclude that 
                        their concerns were purely objective, and that they were not also influenced by partisan considerations, over-zealous reformist
                        ideals, and even politics. In the struggles of the post-imperial period,

                        (see above) materialized as a three volume section included as part of the 
                        Kangyur that was compiled and printed at Tshal Gungtang, of which the original is lost but which is known as 
                        the Tshalpa manuscript. When the Tshalpa Kangyur was completed in 1351, Butön himself consecrated it,
                        apparently raising no objections to the inclusion of these Nyingma tantras despite his own 
                        expressed preference for excluding them. </p>

                        The Nyingma tantra section was missing and is not mentioned at all in Situ Panchen’s <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar chag</foreign>

                        1762 the Nyingma section was left out. Only much later, at some point in the mid-eighteenth century—long 
                        after the death of both Situ Panchen and his successor—were these volumes added, 
                        apparently at the instigation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892).<note place="end" xml:id="O1JC114941JC20566-33">

                        in such obvious contrast to other existing Kangyurs, and for so long—especially in light of the fact that in 1794 the Degé printery had published 
                        a full, twenty-four volume Nyingma Gyübum collection (the only extant xylograph version, compiled and edited by Getsé Mahapandita

                    <p tid="22">The decision to publish tantra texts without restricted access has
                        been considered carefully. First of all, it should be noted that all the
                        original Tibetan texts of the Kangyur, including those in this Tantra
                        section, are in the public domain. Some of the texts in this section (but by
                        no means all of them) are nevertheless, according to some traditions, only
                        studied with authorization and after suitable preliminaries.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC20566-23"/>
                    <p tid="23">It is true, of course, that a translation makes the content
                        accessible to a far greater number of people; 84000 has therefore consulted
                        many senior Buddhist teachers on this question, and most of them felt that
                        to publish the texts openly is, on balance, the best solution. The
                        alternatives would be not to translate them at all (which would defeat the
                        purposes of the whole project), or to place some sort of restriction on
                        their access. Restricted access has been tried by some Buddhist book
                        publishers, and of course needs a system of administration, judgment, and
                        policing that is either a mere formality, or is very difficult to implement.
                        It would be even harder to implement in the case of electronic texts—and
                        even easier to circumvent. Indeed, nowadays practically the whole range of
                        traditionally restricted Tibetan Buddhist material is already available to
                        anyone who looks for it, and is all too often misrepresented, taken out of
                        context, or its secret and esoteric nature deliberately vaunted.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC20566-24"/>
                    <p tid="24">84000’s policy is to present carefully authenticated translations in
                        their proper setting of the whole body of Buddhist sacred literature, and to
                        trust the good sense of the vast majority of readers not to misuse or
                        misunderstand them. Readers are reminded that according to Vajrayāna
                        Buddhist tradition there are restrictions and commitments concerning tantra.
                        Practitioners who are not sure if they should read translations in this
                        section are advised to consult the authorities of their lineage. The
                        responsibility, and hence consequences, of reading these texts and/or
                        sharing them with others who may or may not fulfill the requirements lie in
                        the hands of readers.</p>

                    <p tid="25">The titles (as in all sections) have been translated on the basis of
                        the short Tibetan title given in the Degé Kangyur, taking into account the
                        Sanskrit.</p>

                    <p tid="26">The original Sanskrit titles of the various major tantras are well
                        attested and pose only a few problems here and there. However, in the case
                        of the many lesser known works, the Sanskrit, as given at the beginning of
                        the various Tibetan works in the Degé canon (D) and reproduced with some
                        corrections in the Tōhoku Catalogue (Toh), is often problematic. Not
                        infrequently it is a back translation from the Tibetan title, with Sanskrit
                        adjectives in the wrong places, compounds that are inverted, and other
                        evidence that it was composed following the Tibetan and adopting its word
                        order.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC20566-27"/>
                    <p tid="27">We have done our best to interpret such titles in the most likely
                        fashion, but that has often meant privileging the Tibetan rather than
                        following the Sanskrit word order. In rendering the Sanskrit titles, we have
                        added some word breaks and corrected simple and obvious mistakes such as
                        missing or wrong saṃdhi, wrong long and short vowels, missing retroflex
                        consonants, etc. Many, but not all, of the amendments made by the Tōhoku
                        Catalogue have been adopted. Where the title already contains one or more
                        words with case endings, we have added the case endings to the final words
                            (<term>kalpa</term>, <term>tantra</term>, etc.) in the interest of
                        consistency. We have not, however, attempted to rearrange odd Sanskrit word
                        order or make other such substantial changes. It seemed better to correct
                        only what was obviously wrong in the Sanskrit and leave the rest more or
                        less as it was, not attempting what would, in effect, be a
                        retranslation.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="O1JC114941JC20566-28"/>
                    <p tid="28">For attested proper names we have used the Sanskrit; the rest
                        (including obscure cases) we have translated. In general, the difficulties
                        involved in translating the tantra titles are in many respects much greater
                        than in the case of the sūtras. That said, we consider this a needed start,
                        even if certainly not a final result. In short, what we present here is
                        provisional and should be taken as such.</p>-->
