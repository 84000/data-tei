                    <p tid="3">The texts of the Vinaya, or Discipline (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’dul ba</foreign>) comprise the monastic code, its history, and commentaries on it. As well as
                        detailing all the rules to be kept by monks, nuns, male and female novices, and male and female lay practitioners, they include a wealth of history, biography, and narrative
                        recording the circumstances under which each rule was originally introduced by the Buddha.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="EFT-KB-DISCIPLINE-KANGYUR-SECTION-2"/>
                    <p tid="4">This section of the Kangyur corresponds approximately to the Vinayapiṭaka of the Pāli and Chinese Tripiṭakas. Since it was largely due to divergences in the details of
                        monastic code that early Buddhist groups differentiated into various schools, the vinaya literature of each school is quite different. The Pāli vinaya is that of the Theravāda
                        school, while translations of vinaya texts into Chinese include the more or less complete vinaya literature of five other Indian Buddhist schools.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="EFT-KB-DISCIPLINE-KANGYUR-SECTION-3"/>
                    <p tid="5">The works in this section of the Kangyur were translated into Tibetan from the Sanskrit texts of the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya, the vinaya tradition held by the first
                        monks to bring their ordination lineage to Tibet. Vinaya texts of other schools do not seem to have been translated into Tibetan. While scholars disagree about whether there
                        was a Mūlasarvāstivādin school as such, distinct from the Sarvāstivādin school, the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya is a distinct body of literature many times longer than any other
                        vinaya. It has survived in Tibetan, Chinese, and partially in Sanskrit in the form of manuscripts found in Gilgit. The Tibetan translations represent a more complete version
                        than the Chinese. The Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya literature is notable for its historical and narrative richness and contains material duplicated in, or paralleled by, a
                        considerable number of sūtras, avadānas, and other works and passages elsewhere in the Kangyur; it almost constitutes a canonical collection in its own right.</p>

                                amplified explanations of the monastic code and its history. Two versions of the Uttaragrantha have been preserved in Tibetan translation (here numbered Toh 7 and 7A),
                                of which the second is more complete, the first consisting only of the <title xml:lang="en">Questions of Upāli</title> while the second contains the same text along
                                with a number of others. The colophons and the catalogue of the Degé Kangyur suggest that both versions were retained because of different levels of authentication
                                concerning their respective contents.</p>
