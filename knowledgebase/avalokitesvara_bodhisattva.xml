                    <p tid="2">One of the eight “close sons” of the Buddha, the bodhisattva embodying compassion. He first appeared as a bodhisattva beside Amitābha in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sukhāvatī­vyūha Sūtra</title> (<title xml:lang="en">

                        </title>, Toh 115). In the early tantras, he was one of the lords of the three families, as the embodiment of the compassion of the buddhas.
                        The Potalaka Mountain in South India became important in South Indian Buddhism as his residence in this world, but Potalaka does not feature in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāraṇḍa­vyūha Sūtra</title> (<title xml:lang="en">

                        </title>, Toh 116), which is the most important sūtra dedicated to Avalokiteśvara. Among all bodhisattvas, he attained great significance in Tibet as
                        special protector of the religious life of the country, and in China, in female form, as Kwanyin, protectress of women, children, and animals. The name has been variously
                        interpreted. In its meaning as “the lord of avalokita,” <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avalokita</foreign> has been interpreted as “seeing,” although, as a
                        past passive participle, it is literally “lord of what has been seen.” This has been interpreted in the sense that what Avalokiteśvara has seen is the suffering of sentient
                        beings. One of the principal sūtras in the Mahāsāṃghika tradition was the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Avalokita Sūtra</title>, which has not been translated into
                        Tibetan, in which the word is a synonym for awakening, as it is “that which has been seen” by the buddhas. </p>
