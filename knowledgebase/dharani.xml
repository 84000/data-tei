                                <p tid="945">Regarding this [topic), what are the bodhisattvas' forms of [mental] retention?'119
                    In brief, they should be regarded as being of four types: (1) retention of the Dharma, (2) retention of meaning, (3) retention by means of spells, and (4) the retention that is directed toward attainment of a bodhisattva's forbearance.
                    Regarding this [topic), what is retention of the Dharma?
                    Here a bodhisattva attains a development of power"20 consisting of wisdom and recollection such that by means of it he or she can retain [in the mind] for an immeasurable period of time immeasurable numbers of scriptures containing collections of words, assertions, and syllables that were not committed to memory and were not recited aloud, in the order that they were created and in the order that they were arranged, merely by having listened to them.
                    Regarding this [topic), what is retention of meaning?
                    The description] is the same as before, but in this case there is this differ-ence. [A bodhisattva] retains [in the mind] for an immeasurable period of time immeasurable numbers of meanings relating to the very same Dharma teachings [contained in those scriptures, without having committed them to memory and without having reviewed them in the mind.
                    Regarding this topic, what is retention by means of spells?
                    Here a bodhisattva attains a power of one-pointed concentration such that by means of it those mantra spells that [have the potential to] spiritually influence beings and cure their infectious diseases are rendered effective, supremely effective, and unfailing [in their ability] to cure many different kinds of infectious diseases. This [quality] is called a bodhisattva's "reten-tion by means of spells."
                    Regarding this topic, what is a bodhisattva's [form of mental] retention that is directed toward attainment of a bodhisattva's forbearance? 6.	Here a bodhisattva who has him- or herself practiced the causes fully, 1122 who is possessed of wisdom, lives in solitude, who neither utters speech nor comes within the sight of anyone else, who likewise eats in moderation, does not eat in a haphazard manner, 123 and eats only one kind of food,1124 who is dedicated to meditation, sleeps only a little at night, and maintains a high degree of alertness contemplates, ponders, and examines the meaning of those mantra spells that the Tathagata uttered for the sake of attaining forbearance, such as the one which states): iti miti kiti bhiksanti padani sva hà"S Having correctly undertaken the practice of] these mantra spells and without having heard their meaning from anyone else, he or she realizes it in the following manner: "There is no realization of the meaning of these mantra spells. They do not contain any meaning. Their meaning is that they have no meaning." Following that, he or she does not seek any further meaning. In this way, he or she gains a correct realization of the meanings of these mantra spells.
                    7.	Having gained a correct realization of the meanings of these mantra spells, he or she then gains a correct realization of the meanings of all entities that conforms with that very understanding of the mantra spells]. Without having heard (the meaning of all entities] from anyone else, he or she realizes it in the following manner: "No meaning that pertains to a [real] essence can be established by means of any expressions in relation to any entity.
                    8.	This ineffable essential nature is the meaning that represents their essential nature." After he or she has correctly realized the meaning that represents the essential nature of all entities in this way, [a bodhisattva] does not seek any other meaning. Through having gained a realization of that meaning, he or she attains a joyful rapture. What a bodhisattva attains on the strength of these mantra spells is called a "forbearance." Through having gained that [forbearance], a bodhisattva will before long attain the pur🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛🎛 his or her superior attitude. He or she has advanced to the great form of forbearance that occurs on the stage in which conduct is based upon devorion. This should be understood as the [form of mental] retention that is directed toward the attainment of a bodhisattva's forbearance.
                    Regarding this (topic], after having gone beyond the first span of time that is made up of countless kalpas," a bodhisattva who has entered the stage of a pure superior attitude"7 attains forms of the retention of the
                    Dharma and the retention of meanings that are sure, firm, and exalted. Prior to that time, they are attained on the strength of aspirational prayers or on the basis of meditative absorptions, but they are not sure, firm, or exalted.
                    As with the retentions of the Dharma and meanings, the same should be understood as being true for the retention by means of spells. However, the retention that is directed toward the attainment of a bodhisattva's forbear-ance is only attained in the manner that was just described.
                    Furthermore, a bodhisattva will artain all of these [forms of] retention if he or she possesses four qualities; he or she will not do so if any one of them is missing.
                    What are the four qualities?
                    (r) He or she does not have attachment for sensory pleasures. (2) He or
                    she does nor develop envy toward those who have attained an elevated status and he or she remains free of envy. (3) He or she is one who gives everything that is requested of him or her and is not a giver who regrets [acts of generos-ity] afterward. (4) He or she takes pleasure in the Dharma and is devoted to the Dharma that relates to the bodhisattva collection [of scriptures] or to
                    the manuals for that collection.</p>

                        </div><!--Perhaps the two most widespread senses in which the term is used are when it refers to a mantra-like formula that “encodes”
                        its meaning without necessarily expressing it in comprehensible speech, or when it describes the highly developed capacity of
                        advanced practitioners to memorize and accurately retain a set of detailed and profound instructions. But as well as
                        signifying the means by which such meanings or sets of instructions are retained (i.e., what holds them), it can also
                        designate a specific meaning or instruction itself (i.e., what is held). Furthermore, by extension from these senses of the term, a text that either <emph>contains</emph> a (mantra-like)
                        dhāraṇī, or is <emph>about</emph> a dhāraṇī in any of these senses, may itself be referred to <emph>as</emph> a dhāraṇī. This
                        is the basis for the term dhāraṇī having also come to designate a whole scriptural genre of Mahāyāna texts—well represented in
                        the Kangyur, which contains some two hundred fifty texts in that category. However, as a genre it is both quite diverse in its
                        composition and shares most of the texts it contains with other genres. It is often not entirely clear whether any one text is
                        labeled a dhāraṇī because the text itself <emph>is</emph> a dhāraṇī, <emph>contains</emph> a dhāraṇī, or is <emph>about</emph>
                        a dhāraṇī. For all these reasons, each text placed in this genre deserves its own analysis of what makes it “a dhāraṇī.”--><!--In the
                        case of the present text, mentions are made throughout to a “dhāraṇī of the jewel torch,” but it is difficult to determine
                        whether they all have the same reference, or whether they variously refer to a particular realization of bodhisattvas, to a
                        teaching on that realization, or to the text itself.</p>

                    <p tid="795">In the first chapter, there are four separate occasions on which the dhāraṇī seems to be taught. Although the
                        corresponding mentions could conceivably all be understood as referring to one and the same instance of the dhāraṇī, three of
                        the four occasions end with a statement that the dhāraṇī has now been taught, in the past tense. In the first of the four
                        instances, the exchange between Mañjuśrī, Samanta­bhadra, and the Buddha (starting at <ptr target="#eft-dharani-meaning-86"/>) is
                        termed an explanation of the dhāraṇī in the initial request. In the second instance, Dharma­mati’s long teaching on the ten
                        levels of bodhisattvas is also described as a dhāraṇī immediately afterward by Samanta­bhadra (<ptr target="#eft-dharani-meaning-320"/>). The third instance is a dialog between Mañjuśrī and Śāri­putra (starting at <ptr target="#eft-dharani-meaning-343"/>) in response to the latter’s request for an explanation of the dhāraṇī, which is lauded as
                        a teaching on that dhāraṇī afterward (<ptr target="#eft-dharani-meaning-359"/>). The fourth instance is when yet another request
                        is made to the Buddha, this time by Samanta­bhadra, to teach the dhāraṇī (<ptr target="#eft-dharani-meaning-365"/>); the Buddha
                        teaches what is described as a mantra, and in the discussions that follow it is made clear that the meaning it carries is that
                        of the ineffable ultimate nature of reality.<note place="end" xml:id="eft-dharani-meaning-1282">The four instances here come close
                            to covering, between them, the four types of dhāraṇī set out in the commentarial literature, notably the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bodhi­sattva­bhūmi</title>: the dhāraṇī (1) of Dharma (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharma­dhāraṇī</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">chos kyi gzungs</foreign>), sometimes also called dhāraṇī of

                            and (4) to attain the bodhisattvas’ acceptance (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bodhi­sattva­kṣānti­dhāraṇī</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">byang chub sems dpa’ bzod pa ’thob par byed pa’i

                        Nevertheless, this second instance, the long teaching on the ten levels of bodhisattvas, is clearly also seen as a teaching,
                        in the sense of presenting specific doctrinal content. The third instance is heralded by Śāriputra’s announcement that a sūtra
                        is to be taught, yet what happens turns out to be a short and somewhat cryptic dialog equating explanation with emptiness, and
                        demonstrating how neither can be taught. Only the fourth instance, the mantra, can be reasonably clearly placed in the
                        category of dhāraṇīs that are encoding formulae, and the meaning that the mantra can be assumed to express is linked to the
                        first and third instances in the teaching by Samanta­bhadra that follows it, on how the dhāraṇī should be “retained” and

                        signifiers” that represent their signified objects by virtue of  being similar to them.<note place="end" xml:id="eft-dharani-meaning-17">See Gyatso 1992, p. 179. </note> Noting 
                        common examples of iconic signifiers such as pictures, diagrams, and  metaphors, she argues that dhāraṇīs are analogous to these since—following  the explanation of
                        Dodrupchen—their lack of any conventional meaning is in  fact their meaning: “Again, as the mantric formula itself has no  linguistically expressible meaning, it resembles the
                        thusness that it is  signifying, and so it can be employed as an iconic sign.”<note place="end" xml:id="eft-dharani-meaning-18">Gyatso 1992, p. 191. </note> Here  the idea is that
                        dhāraṇī qua iconic signs can free practitioners from their  own deluded conventions, functioning as “reminders” of inexpressible  emptiness. The assumption is that deluded
                        sentient beings forget the  “profound situation” of emptiness, and gradually may become accustomed to  indexical and symbolic signs that come to be understood as “icons of

                        a/some/many previous buddhas, (5) assertives as benefit statements that  usually concern the dhāraṇī’s power to ward off disease, poison, possession,  or enemies, or that
                        affirm health, welfare, or soteriological efficacy, (6)  assertive hybrid warning statements, (7) ubiquitous expressives such as  praise, homage, confession, and condemnation,
                        (8) perlocutionary expressives  or assertives about the joy and amazement of the audience who received the  dhāraṇī under discussion, and (9) the mantradhāraṇī itself.<note place="end" xml:id="eft-dharani-meaning-29">See Davidson 2014, p. 11. </note>  By identifying these nine types of illocutionary acts across his source  texts, Davidson
