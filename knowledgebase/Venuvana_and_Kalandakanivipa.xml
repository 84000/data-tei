          <p tid="5">The Veṇuvana as a whole was the first offering of land (as an <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ārāma</foreign> or park) made to the Buddha as a place,
            at a suitable distance from the city of Rājaghṛa, in which he and his monks could
            reside. It was donated by King Bimbisāra, King of Magadha.</p>
          <p tid="6">Bimbisāra had met the Prince Siddhartha after the latter had renounced the world but
            before he had attained awakening; according to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvaṃsa</title> they even knew each other as children. </p>
          <p tid="7">Bimbisāra had requested Siddhartha that when he had achieved his spiritual goal he
            would visit Rājaghṛa and instruct him. After his awakening, the period during which he
            reflected alone, and his first teaching at Sarnath to “the five” (his former
            companions), the Buddha also converted “the five friends,” “the fifty brahmin youths,”
            “the sixty youths,” and at Uruvilvā and Gaya the “thousand matted-hair ascetics” under
            Mahākāśyapa. </p>
          <p tid="8">It was at this early point that Bimbisāra sent his soldiers to invite the Buddha to
            travel from Gayasīrsa to Rājaghṛa, and when the Buddha arrived with all these followers
            Bimbisāra offered him the Veṇuvana (as he had vowed to himself according to <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Pūrṇa</title>, see below).</p>
          <p tid="9">The offering formed the first occasion for the Vinaya rule to be defined allowing the
            saṅgha to accept offerings of land from laymen.</p>
          <p tid="10">This is where Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana first met the Buddha and went forth as monks,
            as recounted in <title xml:lang="en">
                            <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-001-001.html#UT22084-001-001-580">The Chapter on Going Forth</ref>

                        </title>.</p>
          <p tid="11">The Buddha spent his second, third, and fourth rains retreat there, and it is recorded
            as the site of many teachings. After the Buddha’s parinirvāṇa, Ānanda may have lived
            there.</p>

          <p tid="13">A particular site—perhaps a grove, or a platform, and later probably a vihāra—within
            the Veṇuvana near Rājaghṛa. It was probably the first place within the Veṇuvana where
            the Buddha stayed, and possibly the main vihara there.</p>
          <p tid="14">The name means “feeding place” (°<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nivāpa</foreign>) or “abode” (°<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nivāsa</foreign>) of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kalandaka</foreign>.</p>
          <p tid="15">What the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kalandaka</foreign> refers to
            remains unclear. According to Pali sources it may mean squirrels, but the Tibetan term
            refers to them being birds, maybe some kind of crow. The suggestion that they were
            flying squirrels may represent a compromise position, but it seems there is a species of
            Indian flying squirrel, <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">Petaurista
              philippensis</foreign>, that might have been in such a habitat. See dictionary entries
            and quote from Gendun Chopel <ref target="#Dict">below</ref>.</p>
          <p tid="16">There are two partly conflicting stories about the site before it was offered and how
            it obtained its name:</p>
          <list type="bullet">
            <item>
              <p tid="17">1) according to the story told in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṅghabhedavastu</title><!--Reference Toh 0001-17--> (Toh 1, ch.17, Degé Kangyur
                vol.4, F.77.b et seq.), the name is said to have arisen when, one day, King
                Bimbisāra fell asleep after a romantic liaison in the Bamboo Grove. While the king
                rested, his consort wandered off. A snake (the reincarnation of the park’s previous
                owner, who still resented the king’s acquisition of the park) approached with malign
                intentions. Through the king’s tremendous merit, a gathering of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kalandaka</foreign>—crows or other birds according
                to Tibetan renderings, but some Sanskrit and Pali sources suggest squirrels, maybe
                flying squirrels—miraculously appeared and began squawking. Their clamor alerted the
                king’s consort to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces,
                thereby saving the king’s life. King Bimbisāra then named the spot Kalandakanivāpa
                (“Kalandakas’ Feeding Place”), sometimes (though not in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>) given as Kalandakanivāsa (“Kalandakas’ Abode”) in their
                honor.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p tid="18">2) according to the story told in <title xml:lang="en">
                                    <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh61.html">The Questions of
                    Pūrṇa</ref>
                                </title> (Toh 61), as an intriguing twist to the story above, in <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh61.html#UT22084-042-002-445">chapter
                  5</ref> the Buddha says that Kalandaka and Veṇuvana are a special place where no
                desire, ignorance, or anger are felt:</p>
              <q source="Toh 61 #UT22084-042-002-445">
                                <p tid="19">“Ānanda, [F.207.a] thus-gone ones have
                  certainly resided in other temples, but those places do not have the same
                  qualities as this one. Why is it so? Because, Ānanda, when animals enter Kalandaka
                  Forest and Veṇuvana, they cease developing sexual desire; and when flocks of birds
                  enter this forest, they no longer sing at inappropriate times. Why is it so?
                  Because when Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, visited his kingdom for the first
                  time after being enthroned, he came to this forest, together with his retinue of
                  queens, to frolic together. However, as soon as he entered here, he felt that his
                  desire for passionate frolicking had disappeared. Everyone in the retinue of
                  queens also felt that any desire for passionate frolicking had disappeared. At
                  that moment, the king became utterly delighted and thought, ‘If a buddha appears
                  in the world and comes to my country, may I meet him face to face. Upon meeting
                  him, may I develop sincere trust in him. Having developed sincere trust, may I
                  worship him. I will offer this forest to that thus-gone one. May he reside in this
                  place, and may I hear the Dharma from him. Why? Because this forest is a place for
                  those who are to be worshiped, not for those who are bound by the five sense
                  desires.’</p>
                <p tid="20">“Ānanda, when King Bimbisāra entered this forest, he had such virtuous thoughts.
                  In the past, thus-gone ones resided in this forest and taught this discourse of
                  the bodhisattva collection. Therefore, none of the qualities associated with this
                  forest are found in other places, and all the worlds with their gods, humans, and
                  demigods are respectfully paying homage to it. Ānanda, in this forest, there are
                  no poisonous snakes, lizards, horseflies, mosquitos, or the like. Beings who
                  reside here do not entertain any evil thoughts: [F.207.b] this is also an
                  extraordinary quality of Veṇuvana. Even if I attempted to express the qualities of
                  this grove for one hundred years, this task would never come to an end. Why is it
                  so? Because, Ānanda, this perfumed chamber of Veṇuvana possesses all those
                  immeasurable qualities, while other places do not.”</p>
                <p tid="21">“Blessed One,” said the venerable Ānanda, “I did not know that Veṇuvana possessed
                  such qualities! Blessed One, I want to confess today my previous negative attitude
                  of not wanting to serve the Blessed One as his attendant.”</p>
                            </q>
              <p tid="22">This same text also describes the place, in the paragraph preceding the above, as a
                unique site for crucial teachings, and (mysteriously) as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">nam mkha’i sa mtshams</foreign> (the “border in space” or “edge of

              <q>
                                <p tid="23">“Therefore, Ānanda, you should remember this discourse of the bodhisattva
                  collection as <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">The Sūtra of Turning the Wheel of
                    Dharma</title>. It is with this teaching that I turned the wheel of Dharma for
                  the hearers in the Deer Park in Vārāṇasī. Ānanda, today, within Veṇuvana, I have
                  also turned this irreversible Dharma wheel, this discourse of the bodhisattva
                  collection, and the doubts of all sentient beings have been eliminated. Ānanda,
                  here, at the edge of space, the thus-gone ones of the past also taught this
                  discourse of the bodhisattva collection. The future thus-gone ones will also teach
                  this discourse of the bodhisattva collection here, at the edge of space. After
                  awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, I have also expounded this
                  discourse of the bodhisattva collection here, at the edge of space. For those
                  reasons, you should know that this place has become a great reliquary of the
                  thus-gone ones, which is to be worshiped by all the worlds with their gods and
                  humans. Ānanda, this is so because this is the only place that has the unique
                  quality of being the location where the thus-gone ones of the past have taught
                  this profound discourse. Ānanda, any sentient being afflicted by desire, anger,
                  and ignorance who enters Veṇuvana, will, without exception, no longer give rise to
                  desire, anger, and ignorance.”</p>

                  food (nivāpa) was regularly placed for the squirrels. It is said that once a
                  certain raja went there for a picnic and, having over-drunk, fell asleep. His
                  retinue, seeing him sleeping, wandered away, looking for flowers and fruits. A
                  snake, attracted by the smell of liquor, approached the king from a neighbouring
                  tree-trunk, and would have bitten him had not a tree-sprite, assuming the form of
                  a squirrel, awakened him by her chirping. In gratitude the rājā gave orders that
                  thenceforth the squirrels in that locality should be fed regularly. UdA.60;
                  SnA.ii.419. According to some, it was the gift of a merchant named Kalandaka
                  (Beal: Romantic Legend, p.315); Tibetan sources identify the rājā with Bimbisāra
                  and say that the snake was a reincarnation of the owner whose land the king had
                  confiscated. According to these same sources the name is Kalantaka and is
                  described as the name of a bird (Rockhill: op. cit., p.43). Kalandakanivāpa was
                  evidently a favourite resort of the Buddha and his monks.</p>

                  “creature” is just the name for a four-legged animal. However, in some instances
                  [of translation] the word is written also as “<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kalandaka</foreign> bird.” Actually, this is a squirrel [<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sre mong</foreign>]. Because it makes its nest in
                  treetops, it could be mistaken for a bird. People say that this [word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kalandaka</foreign>] is used in China as the name
                  of a bird. This creature has a groove on its back that is said to be the mark of
                  [lord] Rāma petting it with his hand because it had comforted Sītā when she was
                  carried off by the demon [Rāvaṇa]. In the Sanskrit synonyms, its name is given as
                  “striped back” [<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rgyab khra</foreign>],
                  which seems to refer to this [physical feature]. It is well known for screaming
                  when it sees a snake. I think there are a great many of them in the bamboo
                  groves.” [Tibetan terms inserted from source text.]</p>
