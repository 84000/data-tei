                            <p tid="50"> The four false views regarding causes (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rgyur lta ba bzhi</foreign>), namely: (i) the
                                false view of nature as a cause (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rang bzhin rgyur lta ba</foreign>); (ii) the false view
                                of a creator [Brahmā divinity] as a cause (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">byed po rgyur lta ba</foreign>); (iii) the
                                false view of Īśvara as a cause (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dbang phyug rgyur lta ba</foreign>); and (iv) the false
                                view of time as a cause (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dus rgyur lta ba</foreign>). These four are established as such
                                because they derive from the false view of eternalism.</p>

                                namely Śaṅkara (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dung ’dzin</foreign>), the master of the eternalists; and Bṛhaspati, the
                                master of the nihilists. These two are respectively the primary [exponents] of eternalism and nihilism.</p>

                        incidental false views (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">zhar byung gi bzhi</foreign>), six exponents of sophistry (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">tarka sde drug</foreign>), four false views regarding causes (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rgyur lta ba bzhi</foreign>), two [primary] preceptors (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mkhan po gnyis</foreign>), and the
                        Aupaniṣadika (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gsang ba pa</foreign>). Together these comprise the three hundred [false views]
                        which depend on the limit of present time.<note place="end" xml:id="EFT-KB-ERRONEOUS-VIEWS-13"> This calculation of three hundred and sixty omits the fifth of the eleven
                            categories, comprising the six teachers who espouse nihilism and their thirty-two views. That same group is also excluded from the
                            list found in the source text, <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">Padma dkar po</title>, p. 361, presumably because the immediately following
                            list of the thirty-six ministers is reckoned to subsume both. </note>
