                    <p tid="5">The Veṇuvana as a whole was the first offering of land (as an <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ārāma</foreign> or park) made to the Buddha as a place, at a suitable distance
                        from the city of Rājaghṛa, in which he and his monks could reside. It was donated by King Bimbisāra, King of Magadha.</p>
                    <p tid="6">Bimbisāra had met the Prince Siddhartha after the latter had renounced the world but before he had attained awakening; according to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvaṃsa</title> they even knew each other as children. </p>
                    <p tid="7">Bimbisāra had requested Siddhartha that when he had achieved his spiritual goal he would visit Rājaghṛa and instruct him. After his awakening, the period during which he
                        reflected alone, and his first teaching at Sarnath to “the five” (his former companions), the Buddha also converted “the five friends,” “the fifty brahmin youths,” “the sixty
                        youths,” and at Uruvilvā and Gaya the “thousand matted-hair ascetics” under Mahākāśyapa. </p>
                    <p tid="8">It was at this early point that Bimbisāra sent his soldiers to invite the Buddha to travel from Gayasīrsa to Rājaghṛa, and when the Buddha arrived with all these
                        followers Bimbisāra offered him the Veṇuvana (as he had vowed to himself according to <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Pūrṇa</title>, see below).</p>
                    <p tid="9">The offering formed the first occasion for the Vinaya rule to be defined allowing the saṅgha to accept offerings of land from laymen.</p>
                    <p tid="10">This is where Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana first met the Buddha and went forth as monks, as recounted in <title xml:lang="en">

                                wandered off. A snake (the reincarnation of the park’s previous owner, who still resented the king’s acquisition of the park) approached with malign intentions. Through

                                and Veṇuvana are a special place where no desire, ignorance, or anger are felt:</p>
                            <q source="Toh 61 #UT22084-042-002-445">
                                <p tid="19">“Ānanda, [F.207.a] thus-gone ones have certainly resided in other temples, but those places do not have the same qualities as this one. Why is it so?
                                    Because, Ānanda, when animals enter Kalandaka Forest and Veṇuvana, they cease developing sexual desire; and when flocks of birds enter this forest, they no longer
                                    sing at inappropriate times. Why is it so? Because when Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, visited his kingdom for the first time after being enthroned, he came to
                                    this forest, together with his retinue of queens, to frolic together. However, as soon as he entered here, he felt that his desire for passionate frolicking had
                                    disappeared. Everyone in the retinue of queens also felt that any desire for passionate frolicking had disappeared. At that moment, the king became utterly
                                    delighted and thought, ‘If a buddha appears in the world and comes to my country, may I meet him face to face. Upon meeting him, may I develop sincere trust in him.
                                    Having developed sincere trust, may I worship him. I will offer this forest to that thus-gone one. May he reside in this place, and may I hear the Dharma from him.
                                    Why? Because this forest is a place for those who are to be worshiped, not for those who are bound by the five sense desires.’</p>
                                <p tid="20">“Ānanda, when King Bimbisāra entered this forest, he had such virtuous thoughts. In the past, thus-gone ones resided in this forest and taught this
                                    discourse of the bodhisattva collection. Therefore, none of the qualities associated with this forest are found in other places, and all the worlds with their gods,
                                    humans, and demigods are respectfully paying homage to it. Ānanda, in this forest, there are no poisonous snakes, lizards, horseflies, mosquitos, or the like.
                                    Beings who reside here do not entertain any evil thoughts: [F.207.b] this is also an extraordinary quality of Veṇuvana. Even if I attempted to express the qualities
                                    of this grove for one hundred years, this task would never come to an end. Why is it so? Because, Ānanda, this perfumed chamber of Veṇuvana possesses all those
                                    immeasurable qualities, while other places do not.”</p>
                                <p tid="21">“Blessed One,” said the venerable Ānanda, “I did not know that Veṇuvana possessed such qualities! Blessed One, I want to confess today my previous negative
                                    attitude of not wanting to serve the Blessed One as his attendant.”</p>

                                <p tid="23">“Therefore, Ānanda, you should remember this discourse of the bodhisattva collection as <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">The Sūtra of Turning the Wheel of
                                        Dharma</title>. It is with this teaching that I turned the wheel of Dharma for the hearers in the Deer Park in Vārāṇasī. Ānanda, today, within Veṇuvana, I have
                                    also turned this irreversible Dharma wheel, this discourse of the bodhisattva collection, and the doubts of all sentient beings have been eliminated. Ānanda, here,
                                    at the edge of space, the thus-gone ones of the past also taught this discourse of the bodhisattva collection. The future thus-gone ones will also teach this
                                    discourse of the bodhisattva collection here, at the edge of space. After awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, I have also expounded this discourse of
                                    the bodhisattva collection here, at the edge of space. For those reasons, you should know that this place has become a great reliquary of the thus-gone ones, which
                                    is to be worshiped by all the worlds with their gods and humans. Ānanda, this is so because this is the only place that has the unique quality of being the location
                                    where the thus-gone ones of the past have taught this profound discourse. Ānanda, any sentient being afflicted by desire, anger, and ignorance who enters Veṇuvana,
                                    will, without exception, no longer give rise to desire, anger, and ignorance.”</p>

                                <p tid="33">“Regarding <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalandaka</foreign>, in many passages in the vinaya, the word is translated as “<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalandaka</foreign> creature,” [<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">srog chags ka lan da ka</foreign>] and in everyday Tibetan, “creature” is just the name for a
                                    four-legged animal. However, in some instances [of translation] the word is written also as “<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalandaka</foreign> bird.” Actually, this is
                                    a squirrel [<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sre mong</foreign>]. Because it makes its nest in treetops, it could be mistaken for a bird. People say that this [word
                                        <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kalandaka</foreign>] is used in China as the name of a bird. This creature has a groove on its back that is said to be the mark of
                                    [lord] Rāma petting it with his hand because it had comforted Sītā when she was carried off by the demon [Rāvaṇa]. In the Sanskrit synonyms, its name is given as
                                    “striped back” [<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rgyab khra</foreign>], which seems to refer to this [physical feature]. It is well known for screaming when it sees a
                                    snake. I think there are a great many of them in the bamboo groves.” [Tibetan terms inserted from source text.]</p>

                                    (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">srog chags ka lan da ka</foreign>) in either the Vinaya section, or elsewhere, in the Kangyur. In almost all references to the
                                Kalandakanivāpa, the word <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ka lan da ka</foreign> is prefixed by “bird” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bya</foreign>). In other contexts, the

                        Kalandaka,” who figures especially in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavibhaṅga</title> (Toh 3) but also in other Vinaya texts as the monk whose actions led to the
