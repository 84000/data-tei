        <head>General Remarks</head>
        <p>Here is the complete documentation for 84000 TEI Documents. In the body there is a list of all the specifications for element, model classes,
          attribute classes, macros, and datatypes. The back matter contains first a set of guidelines for our own markup editors showing the process for the
          markup stage of our texts, which is then followed by some other appendices with further topics and instructions for markup editors. All of these
          sections are accessible through links in the table of contents.</p>
        <p>NOTE FOR UPDATING THE SCHEMA: This ODD contains some content models that are written directly with RELAX NG in order to shape and restrict the form
          for published 84000 texts. If these need to be updated in the ODD, these content models, which outline the whole of the <gi>text</gi> are primarily to
          be found in the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, and <gi>back</gi> elementsSome RELAX NG content
          models are also defined in the a few <gi>macroSpec</gi> elements that are pointed to from within the content models of these four mentioned
            <gi>elementSpec</gi>s. All the the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s have been placed at the beginning of the ODD's XML after the <gi>moduleRef</gi>s and
            <gi>classSpec</gi>s, these are then followed by the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s. See Appendix: <ptr target="#GUIDE_UPDATE_SCHEMA-1"/> for more details on
          proceedures for updating the schema.</p>

            <p>For 84000 texts, the <gi>bibl</gi> element is used for each bibliographic entry in the bibliography within the <gi>back</gi> section of the text.
              However, in each 84000 text the <gi>bibl</gi> element is also used once in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> to describe the bibliographic information for
              the 84000 text itelf; in this case the <gi>bibl</gi> is more elaborate and contains several child elements, see the second example below:</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>
              <gi>body</gi> (text body) contains the whole body of a single unitary text, excluding any front or back matter. So in an 84000 TEI encoded
              document, the body contains the whole translated text. It does not material written by the translator or editors, but just the original text in
              translation. It is part of the <gi>text</gi>, coming after <gi>front</gi> and before <gi>back</gi>. The body section opens approximately the same
              way in every document. The front closing tag precedes the body opening tag. That is followed by the div tag with the type attribute containing the
              "translation" value. This is followed by the head elements, with type values first of "translation" and then "titleMain", and then "titleHon" as
              shown below. After this comes the chapter or section div's, and so on. Even if there is no chapter division in the body of the translated text,
              there is minimally one section or chapter div, containing then the whole of the translation, and closing before the "colophon". Structurally the
              colophon section is equivalent to a chapter, and colophon is a value of a type attribute of a div element. The colophon div closes and then comes
              the closing div tag of the translation, and then the closing body tag. </p>

            <exemplum>
            <p>If a single cell needs to span multiple rows or columns, then this may be done by adding a <att>rows</att>

              see <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh361.html#UT22084-077-002-50">Toh 381 at i.20</ref>.
              The markup for this table is as follows; notice that an empty <gi>cell</gi> element is used in the corresponding spaces over
              which the spanning cell, "day yoga," spans:</p>

              the category of foreign text (tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element) should be marked up either with the <gi>distinct</gi> or <gi>emph</gi>
              element. <gi>distinct</gi> indicates that the italics identify any word or phrase that is not foreign, but is regarded as linguistically distinct,
              for example as archaic, technical, dialectal, non-preferred, etc., or as forming part of a sublanguage. <gi>emph</gi> indicates that the
              italicized words are not in a foreign language but are stressed or emphasized for linguistic or rhetorical effect.</p>

            <p>Occasionally, for whatever reason the chapter numbers may need to be altered. <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">For example in Toh 543</tei:ref>, many chapters are skipped since a
              Sanskrit source was matched to the chapters in the Kangyur. The number needs to be displayed as such in the header but also needs to have the
              proper number prefixed in the table of contents and all the milestones contained within the chapter, all of which will be diverging from the
              number that is automatically generated by the parser. This can be done by adding a single @prefix attribute to the appropriate chapter's
                <gi>div</gi> element. e.g.: </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <div type="chapter" prefix="24">
                <!--...-->
              </div>
            </egXML>
            <p>So <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">this chapter and all its milestones will now display the "24"
                prefix in the reading room</tei:ref> even though it isn't the 24th "chapter" division in the TEI file. </p>
          </exemplum>
          <remarks>
            <p>
              <gi>div</gi> (text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text. All three subsections of the Front are designated by a
              div tag, which includes a type attribute that holds a value reflecting which subsection it is, for example: <tag>div type="acknowledgment"</tag>.
              Likewise the body has a div tag marking the translation, and within the translation, at least two div's, making the main part of the translation
              and the colophon. Any further subdivisions of the translation, into chapters or sections require additional div tags. All of the tags also contain
              the type attribute and translation, chapter, section or colophon values. This works the same way for the back section, with four div tags, at
              least. Each again has the type attribute and values of notes, listBibl (within listBible at least one div with type section) and glossary. </p>
            <p> Note that a prologue<!--, epilogue, dedication,--> or colophon section should be marked as such, e.g., type="prologue" and not be labeled as
              "section". </p>
            <p> The following is the <gi>div</gi> structure of 22084-089-001, Toh 544. It shows only and all of the div tags in the "text", since there are no
              div tags in the teiHeader. <gi>text</gi>

          <remarks>
            <p>Because of the particularities of electronic publishing, P5 Guidelines says that "the term edition may be used for a particular state of a
              machine-readable text at which substantive changes are made and fixed. The words revision and update, by contrast, are used for minor changes to a
              file which do not amount to a new edition. No simple rule can specify how ‘substantive’ changes have to be before they are regarded as producing a
              new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change
              in the intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. " For 84000 texts, the element should include a version number or
              name and can include the <gi>date</gi> element. </p>

              element. <gi>distinct</gi> indicates that the italics identify any word or phrase that is not foreign, but is regarded as linguistically distinct,

              provides a title and statements of responsibility together with details of the publication or distribution of the file, of any series to which it
              belongs, and detailed bibliographic notes for matters not addressed elsewhere in the header. It also contains a full bibliographic description for

            <p>Currently, in 84000 texts the <gi>fileDesc</gi> contains the following elements in this order: a title statement (<gi>titleStmt</gi>), a edition

                <p>Note that sometimes there may be some overlap between what distinguishes the italics tag used for a “term” vs. a “quote.” In such cases you
                  can use your own discretion, but in general italics used for a “term” are for specific a word or phrase that is left untranslated usually
                  because it is technical, untranslatable, or for some other reason. In contrast the italics used for a “quote” are for italics used for a word
                  or phrase citing a specific instance in a source text either to corroborate the English translation, or to note some difference between two or
                  more sources. Both tags are rendered the same in the end, so this isn’t a critical call to make. There is no need spend time looking up
                  italics to determine whether or not they are found in sources, but just keep this general principle in mind when distinguishing the proper tag
                  for italics. </p>

            <p>84000 uses this element to tag foreign words throughout documents with exception for the titles of texts, which should be tagged with the
                <gi>title</gi> element. All instances of the <gi>foreign</gi> element must contain the <att>xml:lang</att> with its value following the <tei:ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1 codes</tei:ref>; however, for any language that is not usually written in a
              Roman script (i.e., Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Pali, etc...), if the language is written in a Romanized script then the first letter should be
              capitalized and "-Ltn" should be added to the value. For example Sanskrit "sa" becomes "Sa-Ltn", Tibetan "bo" becomes "Bo-Ltn", Chinese "zh"
              becomes "Zh-Ltn" and so forth. But use, the regular ISO 639-1 code if the native script is used (usually this should only be the case with Tibetan
              "bo" or Chinese "zh"). Most instances of the <gi>foreign</gi> element should include the <att>type</att> attribute detailed above, although there
              are a few exceptions when foreign text will not fall into the "term" or "quote" category and this attribute is not needed, for instance, the case
              of Tibetan Wylie transliteration given in parenthesis after the phonetic rendering of a Tibetan name. However, in general romanized foreign names
              should not be tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element. This tag should only be used for foreign text that are to be italicized according to
              84000's style guidelines, as our parser will italicize all instances of foreign text in the web display. There is one exception to this, in that
              text in the Tibetan and Chinese script should be tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element, but will not be italicized in the parser.</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>The <gi>front</gi> (front matter) contains any prefatory matter. It is the first section of the <gi>text</gi> structure, so it comes after the
                <gi>teiHeader</gi>, which is outside of the <gi>text</gi> itself, and before the <gi>body</gi>, which is the second part of the <gi>text</gi>
              proper. The front matter of an encoded text should not be confused with the TEI header. The TEI Header, serves as a kind of front matter for the
              computer file itself, not the text it encodes. The <gi>front</gi> contains the written material that does not form part of the translated text,
              including the summary, acknowledgement and introduction (in that order). These three sections in the <gi>front</gi> are nested within <gi>div</gi>
              elements which each are appropriately labeled by the value of their <att>type</att> attribute, as in the following example: </p>

          <remarks>
            <p>In the glossary found in the back material of each 84000 text, the <gi>gloss</gi> element wraps each glossary term with its variations in Tibetan
              and Sanskrit along with a definition. The <gi>gloss</gi> element is requires the <att>xml:id</att> attribute, and the <att>type</att> attribute
              declaring whether it is a "term", "person", "place", or "text". The first <gi>term</gi> element (which has no attributes and presents the English
              translation of the term) will create a link to the glossary in the reading room for each instance of that term as it appears as a string in the
              text. However, in some cases it may be inappropriate to link certain strings of text that match this term and so optionally the <att>mode</att>
              attribute may be added with the values of "marked" or "match". A <gi>gloss</gi> element with the mode "match" will match with all instances of
              that string in the text unless they are marked with &lt;term rend="ignore"&gt;. A term in the glossary with the mode "marked" will only link to
              terms with the <gi>term</gi> element. of the term, that are marked also by <gi>term</gi> tags the type attribute with the value of
              "alternate".</p>
          </remarks>
          <remarks>
            <p>There also may be occasions were the translator has used alternate translations for the same term, or different variations for the spelling of a
              string that correspond to the same glossary entry. In this case an additional <gi>term</gi> element should be added with the value "translationAlternative".
              This will cause the parser to link these alternate string instances of the text in 84000's reading room.</p>

            <p> Unlike the div tags, the text between the opening and closing head tags are visible to the reader. So any major section of the front, body or
              back parts of the text that has a title, wraps that title in a head tag. Head tags need to follow directly after a div tag, or another head tag.
              Head tags have type attributes with values that often match the text between the tags. You can see this in the following snippet, from the front
              part of UT22084-060-008.</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>In 84000 texts the <gi>hi</gi> element is used to render formating including (1) "small-caps", (2) "subscript", and (3) other formating such as "superscript", "bold", "line-through", and "underline". Generally these will
              be used as follows: (1) "small-caps" Latin capital letters are to be used in the abbreviations for Current Era (CE) and Before Current Era (BCE).
              (2) According to <tei:ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">the Vienna Kangyur sigla system </tei:ref>, the second letter
              sometimes uses a subscript letters. (3) Other formatting used as is necessary. </p>
            <p>Note, for "small-caps" in the XML markup, use the lowercase letters, e.g. "ce", they will be rendered
              as uppercase in the display. However the "subscript" and "superscript" should use lower case or upper case according to the proper sigla or text.

              elements within each <gi>lg</gi>. Like the paragraph, <gi>p</gi> element, each <gi>lg</gi> should be preceded by a milestone and itself be
              identified with the <att>tid</att> attribute. However, the markup editors do not need to enter these manually as the <att>tid</att> will be
              automatically applied when the file is saved to the database and the <gi>milestones</gi> will be created by the script.</p>

              <desc>These "type" values are used to identify the types of lists used in various places throughout the text: "glossary" is applied to the main
                list in the glossary, "abbreviation" is applied to the list of abbreviations within the notes section of the text. In addition to these two
                standard lists, the <gi>list</gi> element is also used for any outlines, bulleted lists, or other lists that appear with the actual text itself.
                In this case, the type attribute with the value "section" or "bullet" should be used, and this will effect how the list is displayed by the
                parser. The type value "section" will render a list of sections, with some vertical spacing between each item in the list; this is ideal for
                lists where each item is a paragraph or longer. The type value "bullet" will render the list with indentation but without vertical spacing; this
                is ideal for short items with identifiers (it isn't necessary that there be an actual "bullet" before each item, this is just the name we are
                using to distinguish the type). The latter two list types may also be used in combination to create an outline. For instance, see the sample of
                XML markup below for <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh116.html#UT22084-051-004-45">Toh. 116</tei:ref>. Note, that an
                additionally the attribute @rend="dots", "numbers", or "letters" maybe used to create a list with an automatically generated prefix (bullet,
                numbers, or letters respectively) and a hanging indent(see example below). This can be done in combination with a @type="section" list or a
                @type="bullet" list. For further information on outlines see Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#OUTLINES_LISTS-1"/>. </desc>

                    bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment. Bodhisattvas do perceive such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative level; in an

          <remarks>
            <p>In general <gi>list</gi> elements may be used to demarcate a formal list anywhere in the text. As a standard, <gi>lists</gi> are used in the
              "notes" section to list the source material abbreviations key and used in the "glossary" section to list individual glossary entries.
              Additionally, lists may be used to create outlines or formal lists within the text. Each list must contain <gi>item</gi>s, which contain the
              individual items on a list. When creating an outline or formal list within the text, the <att>type</att>="section" or <att>type</att>="bullet"
              must be used. In the web display, <att>type</att>="section" will render items with some vertical spacing between each item,
              <att>type</att>="bullet" will not have vertical spacing, but will be indented. Multiple <gi>list</gi> elements in combination with these types to
              format an outline. <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh116.html#UT22084-051-004-45">For example see this outline in Toh.
                116</tei:ref> and the XML markup in the example below. For further details on creating outlines see Appendix B Topics <ptr target="#OUTLINES_LISTS-1"/>. <lb/>
                        </p>
            <p>A list may contain a &lt;head type="list"&gt; element to create a bold heading at the beginning before the first <gi>item</gi> in the list.
              Within each <gi>item</gi>, a <gi>label</gi> element can be used to the same effect. See in the XML example below from <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-46">Toh. 11</tei:ref>
              <lb/>
                        </p>
            <p>Note that <gi>list</gi>s along with their <gi>item</gi>s can be generated from the template .docx passed through our XSLT script. In MS Word,
              lists are auto-generated either by clicking the list icons on the menu bar or by entering a "1" or "*" and on a new line and hitting the space
              key. These lists will be rendered by the XSLT script with nested <gi>list</gi> and <gi>item</gi> tags. It can render multi-leveled lists or
              outlines, however they need to be auto-generated list in MS Word for them to pass through the script; you can determine that they are
              auto-generated when in MS Word the cursor will skip over the bullet point or numbered prefix of the list when passed across with the arrow keys.
              The first level <gi>list</gi> will be tagged type="bullet" by default, but second level lists and beyond will need the type attribute to be
              entered manually.</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>The mantra element is used to document any instance of a mantra string. Note that the parser will italicize mantra elements in dependence upon
              its <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. It will be italicized for any language value other than "en" (English) or "mixed". If the mantra is "mixed",
              that is to say fragments of it are represented in more than one language, then those fragments should be further distinguished within the
                <gi>mantra</gi> element with child <gi>foreign</gi> elements (except for English, which is the default). In this scenario, the italics will then
              be rendered according to these child <gi>foreign</gi> elements rather then the <gi>mantra</gi> element itself.</p>
            <p>Note, that the <gi>mantra</gi> element is also used to wrap single or multiple seed syllables referenced in the text and should be labeled
                <att>type</att>="syllable" in such cases.</p>
            <p>If the text ever clearly defines a string as a "dharani", "vidya", "vidyamantra", or "secret mantra", etc... then this should be indicated by a
                <att>type</att> ="dharani", "etc." attribute.</p>
            <p>Because mantras are presented in many different styles and scenarios a guide for how to mark them up is documented in the appendix. Please see
              Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#MANTRAS-1"/> for further details about marking up mantras. </p>

              a text in a somewhat standardized manner. Because there are no consistent natural break points in the original Tibetan texts, the 84000 team
              decided to use milestone tags. They represent small amounts of texts that are in someway semantically cohesive. They are not tied to a specific
              text length, but they are not more than a few paragraphs. See the instructions for entering milestones into the text in the Appendix <ptr target="#GUIDELINES_MILESTONES-1"/>. <lb/>

            <p>Occasionally you may need to display a note differently for two duplicate texts with distinct Toh numbers as there may be content or differences
              that affect one but not the other. It is important that we keep the same index of milestones and notes the same in these parallel versions of
              duplicate texts. However we may differentiate the content of the notes by using separate <gi>p</gi> elements with <att>key</att> attributes to
              distinguish the text contained in each file. See for example note 6 in Toh 725/1001: </p>

                  located in volume 101 of the Degé Kangyur by the Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). However, several other Kangyur databases—including
                  the eKangyur that supplies the digital input version displayed by the 84000 Reading Room—list this work as being located in volume 102. This
                  discrepancy is partly due to the fact that the two volumes of the <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gzungs ’dus</foreign> section are an added
                  supplement not mentioned in the original catalog, and also hinges on the fact that the compilers of the Tōhoku catalog placed another
                  text—which forms a whole, very large volume—the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vimala­prabhā­nāma­kālacakra­tantra­ṭīkā</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dus ’khor ’grel bshad dri med ’od</title>, Toh 845), before the volume 100 of the Degé Kangyur, numbering it as vol. 100,
                  although it is almost certainly intended to come right at the end of the Degé Kangyur texts as volume 102; indeed its final fifth chapter is
                  often carried over and wrapped in the same volume as the Kangyur <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar chags</foreign> (catalog). Please note this
                  discrepancy when using the eKangyur viewer in this translation.</p>

                monks and a great multitude of bodhisatvas. The Buddha then addresses the bodhisatva Jayamati, instructs him on nineteen moral prescriptions,
                and indicates the corresponding effects of practicing these prescriptions when they are cultivated. </p>

          <remarks>
            <p>Most of the <gi>p</gi> elements should be preceded by a <gi>milestone</gi> element. These will be automatically created by the XSLT script, but
              markup editors should go through and delete some of them according to the guidelines for entering in milestones.</p>

                <p>If it has the value "hidden" it will not be displayed in the reading room. This is useful if these references are unnecessary and would be
                  excessive for the typical reader, but should be embedded in the text for the purposes of research. For example, some of the folio refs for the
                  Sanskrit in Toh. 11 are hidden in this way, but there is a note about their availability in the text's introduction. See the example
                  below.</p>
                <p>The value "pending" is only used for references to be linked to other 84000 texts that are not yet published. The URL to the page of the
                  unpublished texts should still be applied to the @target attribute of the <gi>ref</gi>, e.g.,
                  target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh9999.html" But the link will not become active until the @rend="pending" is removed. This @target
                  needs to be added so that the ref will be flagged at the time the unpublished text is published. Furthermore, if the reference points to a
                  particular page in the unpublished text, e.g., a folio number, this should be added as an <att>inst</att> attribute so that the appropriate
                  milestone can be located and added to the URL at the time the text is published. See example below.</p>
                <p>The value "blank" is used if the corresponding folio in the eKangyur is blank. This should not be linked in the Reading Room view, and a note
                  should be added to the grayed out reference, e.g., "This folio of the Degé Kangyur is blank." See <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh287.html#UT22084-068-021-26">for example Toh 287</tei:ref>.</p>

            <p>First, most commonly, the <gi>ref</gi> element is used to mark all folio references and bampo references in the text that correspond to the
              physical Dege pages. The actual reference number should be placed in the <att>cRef</att> attribute. This should always follow the format: F.[folio
              number].["a" for the recto (front) side or "b" for the verso (back) side], for example "F.82.b". Bampo references should be accompanied by the
                <att>type</att> attribute with the value "bampo" and follow the format "B[bampo number]", for example:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <p tid="81">
                <ref cRef="F.1.b" type="folio"/>
                <ref cRef="B1" type="bampo"/> I pay homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas. <!--...-->
              </p>
            </egXML>
          </exemplum>
          <exemplum>
            <p>Folio/page reference numbers referring to additional language sources should be marked as such with the @type attribute. If there are a lot of
              these in order to distinguish these from the square brackets of the Tibetan refs, curly brackets will need to be used instead. since the @cRef
              attribute will automatically display square ones, the reference should be placed with in the node and the @cRef should not be used:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <p tid="81">
                <ref cRef="F.1.b" type="folio"/>
                <ref type="sanskrit">{S1}</ref>
                <ref type="chinese">{C1}</ref> I pay homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas. <!--...-->

          </exemplum>
          <exemplum>
            <p>Note, there are some texts that are duplicated in multiple sections of the Kangyur. For example The Prophecy of Sri_Mahadevi is found twice in
              the Kangyur as Toh. 193 and 739. Theses are both word for word exactly the same, but the folio references are going to be different for each
              duplicate version of the text. So in this situation we just use one TEI file, "061-014_toh193,739" but the folio references are differentiated
              with the <att>key</att> attribute which will relate each individual <gi>ref</gi> to the corresponding <att>key</att> that is declared within that
              version's <gi>bibl</gi> element found in the TEI's initial <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. For example, in 061-014_toh193,739's <gi>sourceDesc</gi>:</p>

            <p>The <gi>ref</gi> element is also used to create links in the Reading Room to other 84000 published texts or other websites. The web address
              entered in to the value of the <att>target</att> attribute. Note that in-text links should not be made with <gi>ref</gi>s but with the
                <gi>ptr</gi> element instead. Any links to 84000 that are not yet published can be made with a coded comment <code>&lt;!--Reference Toh
                ####--&gt;</code>, which will be retrieved and applied when the future text is published. See Appendix <ptr target="#CROSS_REFERENCES_LINKS-1"/>
              for more details. </p>

            HTML but causes problems for the ebook publication. If spanning cells become necessary in the future, let's talk with 
            Dom about the best markup and method for doing this:
          <exemplum>
            <p>If a single <gi>cell</gi> needs to span multiple rows or columns, then this may be done by adding a <att>rows</att>
              or <att>cols</att> attribute respectively to that specific <gi>cell</gi> with the numeric value for how many rows/columns to span, for example
              see <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh361.html#UT22084-077-002-50">Toh 381 at i.20</ref>.
              The markup for this table is as follows; notice that an empty <gi>cell</gi> element is used in the corresponding spaces over
              which the spanning cell, "day yoga," spans:</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>Tables contains an optional heading and a series of <gi>row</gi>s. Generally the style of the table will be generated automatically by the parser
              and the width of each column and row will be determined by the longest string of text in that column or row; however if the default table is
              rendered ineloquently in the HTML, as an option the <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to define the width of the first column:
              @rend="firstcol-30pc" will set the width of the first column to 30% of the width of the full table, "firstcol-40pc" and "firstcol-50pc" will set
              it to 40% and 50% respectively. This was used, for example, in the <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh307.html#appendix">appendix of Toh 307</tei:ref> to display the tables there with a consistent column width in relation to each other.</p>
            <p>Currently no <att>type</att> is being used, but this may be added to the schema and documentation when it becomes necessary. Cells and rows
              should be assigned <att>role</att>="label" if they are considered to be the label or heading in which the subsequent <gi>cell</gi>s are considered
              to be data relevant to that label. If a <gi>row</gi> contains the <att>role</att>="label" attribute, then all of its child <gi>cell</gi>s will be
              considered to be "label"s as well. </p>
            <p>Note, when marking up <gi>table</gi>s the markup editor should check that the table renders properly in the reading room's web display. In
              addition, the table needs to be checked in the ebook display as well. This can be done by adding the code: <code>?viewmode=epub</code> to the very
              end of the url address on the utilities page. In truth, the tables are not compatible with the ebook format, so the parser will instead display
              them as a bulleted list. The information in this list should be presented in a complete and eloquently readable way, otherwise the parser should
              be updated.</p>

            <p> The following description from the University of Michigan is available as part of a PDF at <tei:ref target="http://www.lib.umich.edu/files/departments/dpp/20101113_06.pdf">http://www.lib.umich.edu/files/departments/dpp/20101113_06.pdf</tei:ref>
              "The TEI header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>) is the ‘virtual title page’ of a TEI document. It contains meta data (information about the TEI document).
                <gi>teiHeader</gi> is the first, mandatory child element of the root <gi>TEI</gi> element; therefore, it appears at the top (‘at the head’) of
              every TEI document. The header meta data provides: 1. bibliographic record of the electronic text as well as the source from which the electronic
              text is derived 2. documentation of the encoding and editorial principles used in tagging the electronic text 3. terms for indexing, searching,
              and retrieval 4. a record of changes made to the electronic document. The header contains many specialised elements not found anywhere in the
              ‘body’ of a TEI document (that is, everything after the close of <gi>teiHeader</gi>). These elements allow for highly structured descriptions of
              the document. Many parts of the header allow free-form prose descriptions as an alternative to the highly structured descriptions. Few header
              elements are required, so a header can be quite minimal." </p>

            <p>Primarily the <gi>term</gi> element is used to list glossary terms in the back matter of a text. For each individual <gi>gloss</gi> element,
              which constitutes a single glossary entry, a list of several <gi>term</gi> elements are used (see the example below). The first <gi>term</gi>
              element, which should have no attritutes, shows the English translation of the term or the string used in for that term as it is found in the
              text. This first <gi>term</gi> element indicates to the parser which word or string of text to link to the glossary entry, and it will create a
              link for every instance of that term that is found in the text. The next <gi>term</gi> elements that follow within the <gi>gloss</gi> list the
              Wylie, Tibetan, and Sanskrit for that term, all indicated by the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute with the appropriate value. After that a definition
              is given in its own <gi>term</gi> element with the type="definition" attribute. Finally, if there are any alternate translations used for the term
              within the text that should be linked to this gloss, they are listed last each marked by type="translationAlternative". These instances of alternative
              strings of text will also be linked to the glossary entry wherever they are found in the text. All of this can be seen in the first example below.
              For further notes about the glossary see Appendix: <ptr target="#GUIDELINES_GLOSSARY-1"/>.</p>

          <exemplum>
            <p>The <gi>term</gi> element may also be used in the text itself to alter the way a string of text is to be linked to the glossary. For example, a
              string of text can bypass being linked if it is placed within a <tag>term rend="ignore"</tag> as like the following example. Alternatively, if the
              parent <gi>gloss</gi> element for an entry is given the attribute mode="marked" then it will only link to instances in the text that are contained
              within a <gi>term</gi> element. If there are three or more glossary entries of the same string, then these may be more precisely distinguished
              within the body of text by adding a @ref attribute pointing to the specific glossary entry to which they refer (In this situations the
                <gi>gloss</gi> entry should be <att>mode</att>="marked"). For more details on how the glossary functions on the web page see Appendix: <ptr target="#GUIDELINES_GLOSSARY-1"/>.</p>

              in the web display. All <gi>title</gi> should have a <att>xml:lan</att> attribute with the value appropriate to the language used. Below is an
              example from Toh 544, from the introduction. </p>

              Chinese. In the case of the header appearance, title denotes the title of the translated work.</p>

        <head>Checklist for 84000 TEI Markup Editors</head>
        <p>Following below are complete step-by-step guidelines for marking up 84000 TEI. To reference how the markup stage is integrated with the entire 84000
          workflow, here is link to the <tei:ref target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XtNBnI-RDWZ2KepY2R2mXPuada3-8xOVSCRTcB6B9Q/edit?usp=sharing">Editorial
            and Publications Workflow</tei:ref> document.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Check the MS Word Document from Project Management</head>
          <p>According to our current workflow, when a text is passed to markup it should be already uploaded to <tei:ref target="https://projects.84000-translate.org/index.html">project management</tei:ref>. First click on the "Search" tab and locate the file using the
            Toh number. Once you have found the text click on "edit headers", from there you can expand the "submissions" section (The TEI will be generated
            from this same screen as well, see below). From here you may click on the document and download it in order to check the document from MS Word. The
            copyeditors will have entered most of the proper style tags for foreign terms, verses, some of the mantra markup, and so forth. However, when you
            begin a text it is important to double check the work and make sure the text has been entered properly into the template. Also, sometimes you may be
            asked to apply the style tags into the template yourself, so as you continue to edit TEI markup, you should occasionally read the instructions in
            the copy editor's template and try to become familiar with them <tei:ref target="http://translator-tools.84000-translate.org/index.html?tab=copy-editors">(The latest version of the copy editor's template may be
              downloaded here)</tei:ref>. A lot of the tags are set up to be tagged with character and paragraph styles from the template and automatically
            converted by a script into to correct markup. However, the copy editors may occasionally make some mistakes, and being familiar with the template
            will help you correct them and inform the copy editors of any issues. Remember, sections can always be corrected from the template, passed through
            the script again, and pasted into the final TEI so keep the original word document open for reference while you work.</p>
          <p>When checking the document please follow check that the following is applied in the DOCX:</p>
          <list>
            <item>In general you can corraborate with the instructions written in the template.</item>
            <item>Check that the text has tagged the appropriate sections using the "Heading 1, 2, 3, etc" headings. The "Heading 1 and 2" styles should be
              embedded in the template, but the copy editor will add more headings as is needed. All of these headings will trigger the script to generate
              section divisions in the TEI. MS Word has heading styles up to "Heading 9". In the rare case that more are needed, hard tags will be used e.g.
              "&lt;level 10 header&gt;", which will need to be applied manually from Oxygen. If the editors have removed one of the default headings by accident
              it may cause a section to be missing in the converted TEI. One way to check is to look in under the view tab in MS word and check the box that
              says "Navigation Pane". This should show you an outline of the text from a side window, which should follow a layout according to the heading
              styles. "The Introduction" and "The Translation" should either be filled with subsections or just one default subsection that says "Main
              Section".</item>
            <item>All the italics have been applied with the various character styles, "foreign-", "title-", etc. (don't worry though, if you miss some, those
              italics will be given a &lt;fix&gt; tag by the script).</item>
            <item>Because the markup for mantras has become a bit complicated, we have provided the copy editors an "Option Two" for applying style tags to all
              the mantras. This instruction was given in case differentiating the different "mantra" styles becomes too distracting from the actual copy editing
              work. Under "Option Two," the copy editor will tag all of the mantra italics with the character style "Mantra-Other" and you will need to
              distinguish and apply the appropriate markup to the mantras. You can do this either now, while you are checking the template, or you can pass the
              template through the script as it is and all the mantras will be tagged &lt;mantra type="input type" xml:lang="input language"&gt; and you can
              mark them up in the XML. However, I recommend doing this from the template as it will be faster. You can quickly find all the "Mantra-Other" tags
              by doing an "advanced find and replace" and click on the Format --&gt; "Style" in the search dialog box. Leave the search bar empty and you can
              quickly go through all the "Mantra-Other" styles in the entire template and apply the correct style from the style pane. See instructions for the
              mantra markup in the template II. MANTRAS, pp 3–5, or see the full documentation for the mantra markup here in Appendix B Topics <ptr target="#MANTRAS-1"/>.</item>
            <item>All the verses have the "verse" paragraph style applied, and they are formatted correctly with line breaks between lines and paragraph breaks
              between stanzas (change the display settings to show paragraph marks and line breaks so you can see more clearly whether they are formatted
              correctly).</item>
            <item>In some cases the copy editors may have left comments for the markup editors with the MS Word comments feature. The script will convert these
              into <gi>note</gi> elements that will have the "place" attribute with the value of "comment_from_copyeditor_to_markup_editor." I have
              intentionally set this up to be highlighted by the schema as an error, so that the copy editors may highlight any unusual formatting or other
              issues that need to be addressed by the markup editors. You may leave these in and address them as you work on the XML or alternatively keep a
              backup of the .docx and reference the comments from there. If you don't want to see them in the XML, make a backup of the .docx and select "Delete
              All Comments in the Document" from the review pane in Word before sending the document through the conversion script.</item>

Convert the file to a "TEI P5 XML Document" and run our own .xslt script on the document. The .xslt script is in

            </head>
            <item>This should create a file that is closer to what we want. However, the script is definitely not perfect, and many sections will need some
              reworking.</item>
            <item>If the "verse" styles were applied appropriately in the template, then the script should put them correctly into <gi>lg</gi> and <gi>l</gi>
              elements. It should also preserve and convert any italic markup within the verses. The script is able to do both because in MS Word the "verse" is
              a paragraph style and all the italic markups are character styles. However, for the script to work properly the individual lines of verse need to
              be separated by line breaks, and the stanzas themselves need to be separated by paragraph breaks. There are instructions for how to do this in the
              template, but this process can be a bit finicky, so you should double check some of the verses to make sure the conversion has worked properly.
              Refer to the section on the <gi>lg</gi> element to see how verses need to be formatted. </item>
            <item>Another note about the script to keep in mind is that the script is designed to automatically create divisions with <gi>div</gi> elements in
              the markup whenever the copy editors use the "heading 1," "heading 2," etc. styles in the template (up to "heading 9"). This will create the
              proper levels of <gi>div</gi>s. Any tenth level <gi>div</gi>s or further should be placed into tags by the copy editor and you will need to create
              the <gi>div</gi>s manually when you edit the XML. Occasionally, the copy editor will put a heading into the "heading 1" or "heading 2" style but
              they will mistakenly leave the paragraph break at the end of the heading's text in the "normal" style. The script generates the <gi>div</gi>
              elements according to these paragraph breaks, so in this case, it will not create the proper division. Usually it is easy enough to correct these
              in either the template .docx or in the .xml, but in some cases it may save you some time if you can identify and fix them before the conversion.
              For example, this happened in the bibliography of a text, and because the bibliography entries were nested with one <gi>div</gi> instead of two,
              the script rendered them into <gi>p</gi> elements instead of <gi>bibl</gi> elements as is required. </item>
            <item>The script has a section for making appendices, which should appear in the <gi>back</gi> after the bibliography. However, since not all the
              texts have appendices, and since appendices could appear in many different forms such as lists, outlines, Sanskrit sources, etc., the script only
              converts these into the minimal default paragraphs or verses. You may need to reformat the markup in the section extensively or paste it in from
              the word file and mark it up from there. If there are more appendices in the future, or a particularly large appendix that needs to be extensively
              edited, we will develop the script to convert the appendices in a more detailed way.</item>
            <item>If there is some unusual formatting or other issue that is preventing the script from converting the text properly, one strategy for isolating
              the problem is to divide the text into three pieces (front material, body, and back material), convert each section one be one, and then paste
              them into the final .xml. In this case do the conversion through <tei:ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/#">oxGarage</tei:ref> (Instructions for this
              are found in the Appendix: <ptr target="#GUIDE_XSLT_SCRIPT-1"/>).

              <hi rend="bold">Merge the Converted XML into the Placeholder File:</hi>
            </head>
            <item> When you have finished converting the document into an TEI-XML file, it is time to transfer it into the translations folder. There should
              already be a placeholder file for each of the Kangyur and Tengyur texts. Go to 84000 Collaboration &gt; apps &gt; 84000-data &gt; tei &gt;
              translations, and you will see the "kangyur" and "tengyur" folders. Each of these folders in turn contain a "placeholders" folder and a
              "translations" folder. Find the placeholder file right click and select "cut" then move it into the sibling "translations" folder by right and
              select "paste" (don't use "copy" and "paste" as this will reset the files permissions). </item>
            <item> Now please change the file name to reflect what has been given as an English title by the translator. The previous title was translated
              before the project, so we want the filename to be consistent with what the translator has given. ***Important: please don't use any apostrophes or
              diacritics in the filename and remove any that happen to be there, as these will create problems for the server.</item>
            <item> You can then begin pasting the text from the XML you just converted into the placeholder text. The placeholder files usually just contain the
                <gi>teiHeader</gi>, however, most of this is important information and should not be overwritten. The converted XML will have directions in the
              form of comments, which will tell you specifically what elements within the teiHeader need to be added to the placeholder, and which to be left as
              is. In general, try to preserve all pertinent information from both sources, and if there is any data that seems to be contradictory, comment out
              the additional data and make a note of this in your final list of notes and issues.</item>
            <item xml:id="Title-Statement-1"> The placeholder's <gi>titleStmt</gi> will require some extra attention; this contains the original collection of
              titles given to texts when the 84000 project first begin. However, when translations for these texts are made there will likely be many changes
              that need to be applied to the various titles. There may be additional alternative titles discovered through the translator's research, but there
              may be some alternative titles found in the placeholder file that the translator did not notice. So when merging the <gi>titleStmt</gi> in the
              converted XML with the placehoder please use the following protocol: <list>
                <item>Update any English title to the one used by the translator found in the converted XML.</item>
                <item>Preserve any alternative titles found in either the converted XML or the placeholder file. Alternative titles should be labeled
                  type="otherTitle"</item>
                <item>Make sure that the Sanskrit and Tibetan short titles, i.e., "otherTitles", are consistent with the English title in terms of the prensense
                  of the final "འི་མདོ།" or"-sūtra". These should be removed if the word "Sūtra" isn't also found in the corresponding short English title. This
                  presence or absence of "Sūtra" is not significant enough to warrant adding an additional "alternativeTitle"</item>
                <item>Sanskrit Titles should have the first letter capitalized.</item>
                <item>There should be a minimum of nine titles: 4 Main Titles (Sanskrit, Tibetan, Wylie, English), 4 Long Titles (Sanskrit, Tibetan, Wylie,
                  English), and 1 Chinese. Any additional variant <gi>title</gi>s (whether coming from the converted file or already present in the placeholder)
                  should be added after this as type="otherTitle". The actual order of the titles doesn't matter because the parser will display them in the
                  same order no matter what order the XML is in, but if one or more of the nine default titles are not present, leave an empty element there as
                  a place holder, e.g., &lt;title type="otherTitle" xml:lang="zh"/&gt;. Here is an example of the nine titles from Toh 65: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            </head>
            <list>
              <item>The schema should already be applied to the placeholder file, but if you need to apply the schema directly it is located in “84000
                Collaboration &gt; apps &gt; 84000-data &gt; schema &gt; current &gt; translation.rng.” You will see any schema errors as red bars on the right
                column in the oXygen window. Checking the schema is the best way to see if the XML is going to work correctly in the parser. If later on you
                have trouble saving to the database, or if you can save to the database but the web page does not display the text, then start by checking for
                schema errors in oXygen. If it says that there is an error where you don’t think there is really an error, but you need to check the XML on the
                web display, you can comment-out that section with comment tags:<lb/> &lt;!-- --&gt; (or highlight and press Ctrl-Shift “,” on PC or
                Command-Shift "m" on mac). Then you will be able to temporarily block all the seeming schema errors to help identify the problem. </item>
              <item>You will initially see many schema errors for some missing attributes such as "xml:id"s and "tid"s. Note that all "xml:id" attributes, "tid"
                attributes in the <gi>p</gi> elements, and "index" attributes in the <gi>note</gi> elements will be added automatically when you save and reload
                the XML, so you don't need to worry about adding these. However, in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> within the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> there is an
                element for the id number for the text, <gi>idno</gi>. This should have been already present in the placeholder folder, however if it is missing
                retrieve it from your manager and enter it in manually as this is needed to generate all the xml:id attributes in the text.</item>
              <item>In case there is an error in any of the "xml:id" or "tid" attributes due to duplicates, then you can regenerate them by deleting any
                problematic ones, saving the file, and then re-opening. The "xml:id" and "tid" will be generated wherever they are missing. If not, email the
                lead technician and they will make sure they are regenerated. It is fine if the "xml:id" attributes are not in order as long as they each have a
                unique value.</item>

            </head>
            <list>
              <item>While editing the XML, I usually use a previously edited and published TEI document as a model to make sure everything is formatted in the
                same way. This can be helpful, especially if this is your first time marking up a text or if you haven't done the markup for some time. Toh 83
                is our go to as the standard for markup. This is a simple text, one of our earliest publications, and the first place we look when assuring that
                our markup is consistent. Toh 83 is a good standard, although because it is a simple text it may not have references for how to deal with the
                markup used in special cases. Here are some other texts with published TEI, which you may refer to for specific markup situations: <list>
                  <item>For a text containing a lot of mantras: see Toh 431</item>
                  <item>For a text with a complex outline (containing 6+ levels of <gi>div</gi>s): see Toh 1-1</item>
                  <item>For a text with extensive Chinese quotations in the notes: see Toh 61</item>
                </list> Also, if you are looking for a specific element try right clicking on the published "translations" folder and searching for a specific
                example to reference, e.g., "&lt;table" to find a reference of the <gi>table</gi> element. </item>
              <item>In general, while going through the text, it is important to periodically refer back to the .docx you received from the copy editor. If the
                document has an unusually formatted outline, some portions of text may be lost in the XSLT conversion. A good way to check this is to open the
                original .docx and look at the outline of the text (on PC go to “View” and check the box that says “Show Navigation Pane”; on Mac go to “View”
                &gt; “Sidebar” &gt; “Document Map Pane”; this might be different for other versions of Word). For example, if there are any fourth-level headers
                or extra divisions in the summary or acknowledgements, these sections may disappear. It is particularly good to check the front material and the
                bibliography for anything unusual.</item>
              <item>The template should generate a placeholder for sponsorship in the Acknowledgements section (e.g. "[Sponsored by XXXXX.]"), this is just a
                placeholder for the sponsor so the editors and Line remember to check the sponsorship with Jing Rui before publication. Please leave it as is
                unless instructions from management say otherwise.</item>
              <item xml:id="acknowledgements-guide-1">The acknowledgements section should be formatted in the following manner: <list>

                    <div type="translation">

                  </body>
                </egXML> The reason for this, is the script has a safeguard to display any text within the first main <gi>div</gi> but not included in the first
                second level <gi>div</gi>. A not ideal consequence of this safeguard results in this repetition of the first two lines, which simply needed to
                be deleted manually. So the above example should be edited to look as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <body>
                    <div type="translation">

              <item>If there were any italics that were missed in the copy editing phase, they will appear with a schema error in an element called "fix." You

                <gi>distinct</gi>, <gi>mantra</gi> etc. Sometimes these may be just italicized punctuation that the copy editor or author made by mistake, in
                which case you can go ahead and remove these tags.</item>
              <item>Any <gi>foreign</gi> or <gi>title</gi> tags that are not tagged as English, Sanskrit, or Tibetan language, will need to have their @xml:lang
                tag entered in manually. These will all be highlighted by a schema error for the value of @xml:lang="Input_Language". In each case please apply
                the appropriate language code (the list of language codes can be referenced in the documentation for the <gi>foreign</gi> element.</item>
              <item>Check that all mantras have been properly tagged. Note, that any mantras that have fragments of them written in more than one
                languages--usually English with Sanskrit seed syllables but this may also include Sanskrit/Tibetan mixed mantras--will be marked as such in the
                template and be converted to &lt;foreign type="Fragment-in-MixedMantra"&gt;. They will appear as errors in the schema which is a signal for you
                to wrap the complete mantra in a &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt; element. Then the @type="Fragment-in-MixedMantra" can be removed with the
                refactoring tool once they are all wrapped. <gi>mantra</gi>s need to be tagged in precise way, please see Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#MANTRAS-1"/> for details on how to markup the mantras. </item>
              <item>Double check that the tag &lt;hi rend="small-caps"&gt; is used for any small capital letters in the text. This includes any abbreviations
                for CE ("Common Era") or BCE ("Before Common Era") in dates. Note that the lowercase letter needs to be used for small-caps, for example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> In the year 2000 <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi>
                </egXML> Then the parser will render this as small capital "BCE".<lb/> (If for some reason you ever need to add diacritics to small-caps, see
                details about this in the documentation for the <gi>hi</gi> element).</item>
              <item>Note that some of the Kangyur sigla in the abbreviations and notes use subscript letters. For Kangyur sigla we use the Vienna system, which
                  <tei:ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">you can check the spelling here.</tei:ref> Most of the sigla use a Capital
                letter followed by a lowercase one, but the sigla from the Peking Group, Mongolian, and Nyingma Kangyurs use a capital letter followed by
                subscript letters, and these second letters should have the &lt;hi rend="subscript"&gt; tag. Here either the lowercase or uppercase letter
                should be used according to the definitive sigla, for example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Peking 1737 PK = K<hi rend="subscript">Q</hi>, rnying rgyud bris ma = G<hi rend="subscript">bm</hi>. </egXML> Do not use any unicode for the small caps or
                subscript such as "ʙᴄᴇ" or "ᵥ" as this won't display consistently in the reading room for all browsers. The script should convert all small-caps
                and subscript from the template with the proper tag, if "small-caps" and "subscript" were applied in the template using MS Words Font dialog
                (Format &gt; Font), but these should be double checked in the XML.</item>
              <!--<item>Typically there will be many left over "<gi>hi</gi>" elements after the script has
              converted the text. With the one exception of rendering small capital and subscript
              letters (as shown in the example above) we don't really don't use any of these
                <gi>hi</gi> elements in our mark up. Most of these are just remnants of formatting
              from the word document, and the script should convert all of these to
              type="wordfile-remnant". The refactoring tool is very helpful for removing them. In
              the oXygen menu go to "Tools" > XML Refactoring, and then select "unwrap element."
              This operation removes the "<gi>hi</gi>" tags but leave the text within them
              untouched, however we only want to remove the <hi type="wordfile-remnant">
              elements but not the <hi rend="small-caps"> and <hi
              rend="subscript">elements. To do this, after selecting the "unwrap element"
              operation, it will ask us for the Target Elements (XPath). For this we should enter
              the XPath: <code>hi[@type="wordfile-remnant"]</code> This will only remove the
                <gi>hi</gi> elements with this attribute. Now you can click on "Next" and then
              "Preview". Note that it will ask you to save all opened editors, so be sure to close
              any editor windows that you don't want saved. The Refactoring tool is very useful for
              removing or changing other unwanted markup as well. However, use some caution when
              making global changes like this. You will want to make sure you aren't removing any
              important data. Using the preview mode, you can see how a command is going to effect
              the text. In most cases, we will want to remove all the "<hi
              type="wordfile-remnant">" tags, but before using the refactoring tool to remove
              them, be sure to take a quick glance through the text and make sure the <gi>hi</gi>
              tags are not being used for a significant markup that may have been missed or
              unrepresented in the copy editing phase. If you are unsure, or if the <gi>hi</gi> tags
              are too messy to tell, save a backup copy of the markup before removing them with the
              refactoring tool, then you can check them once more after you finish marking up the
              text.</item>-->

            <list>
              <item>All the references such as [F.100.a], etc. need to be entered into <gi>ref</gi> elements with the "cRef" attribute, thus [F.100.a] should
                look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <ref cRef="F.100.a" type="folio"/>
                </egXML> Note that this is the standard we are using for all folio references: it should be an "F" followed by a period, a number, another
                period, and the letter "a" or "b." To put the bracketed folios into the <gi>ref</gi> element I usually use a search and replace with regular
                expressions. To do this open a find and replace box, check the "Regular Expressions" box and search for: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">\[(F\.\d+\.[ab])\]</egXML> Replace with: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                    <ref cRef="$1" type="folio"/>
                                </egXML> Or if they forgot to add the second period before that "a" or "b," like "[F.100a]", then search for: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">\[(F\.\d+)([ab])\]</egXML> And replace with: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                    <ref cRef="$1.$2" type="folio"/>
                                </egXML> Another situation you might see is double folios for duplicate Toh versions such as, "[(Toh 674)
                F.212.a] [(Toh 849) F.58.a]". Since you need to copy over the Toh # as the key, you can do that with a regular expression like this, search:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">\[\(Toh (\d+)\) (F\.\d+\.[ab])\]</egXML> And replace: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                    <ref key="toh$1" cRef="$2" type="folio"/>
                                </egXML> Regular expressions are very useful for such tasks,
                just be careful not to search and replace any text or markup you did not intend to. For example, the introduction of a text might quote a folio
                reference number in the same format in which it was applied in the body of the text, say "[F.100.a]". We definitely don't want this instance
                placed into a <gi>ref</gi> element, so be careful not to inadvertently replace it with a "replace all" command. If you aren't familiar with
                regular expressions <tei:ref target="https://regexr.com/"> this is a good reference website</tei:ref>, and there are a lot of tutorials on youtube too. </item>
              <item>Sometimes there are other reference numbers used within the texts such as bampo numbers or page numbers referencing another source. All of
                these should also be placed in <gi>ref</gi> elements using the following conventions: <list>
                  <item>Bampo references should be accompanied by the type attribute with the value "bampo" and follow the format "B[bampo number]", for
                    example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                      <ref cRef="B1" type="bampo"/>
                    </egXML>
                  </item>
                  <item xml:id="Sanskrit-folio-1">References to a Sanskrit, Chinese, or other source should be accompanied by the type attribute with the value
                    "sanskrit", "chinese" etc. Typically curly brackets should be used to differentiate the Sanskrit or Chinese references from the Tibetan
                    ones. Because the parser automatically generates square brackets around the cRef attribute, the inner node of the <gi>ref</gi> element
                    should be used with typed curly brackets, for example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                      <ref type="sanskrit">{S1}</ref>
                    </egXML>
                  </item>
                  <item>Note that whatever is placed in the @cRef attribute, will appear in square brackets in the reading room. Occasionally the author or
                    editors may wish to hide a certain of reference number if they are deemed to be unnecessary for the general readership. In this case they
                    may be given the attribute @rend="hidden", which will hide the reference in the reading room while still being marked in the TEI. For
                    example this is done with some Sanskrit <gi>ref</gi>s in Toh 11: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                      <ref cRef="1" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>
                    </egXML>
                    <p>Note, here it doesn't matter whether the cRef is used or the inner node is used since it will be rendered invisible in the Reading
                      Room.</p>
                  </item>
                </list>
              </item>
              <item>When a <gi>ref</gi> comes between two paragraphs, it is better to place it at the end of the preceding paragraph rather than the beginning
                of proceeding one, as this will be less distracting for the reader. The very first <gi>ref</gi>, however, must be placed at the beginning of the
                paragraph as there is no other choice.</item>
              <item>When a large text spans multiple volumes a volume reference should be added at the beginning of the new volume just before the first folio
                reference of the new volume using the following format: <code>&lt;ref type="volume" cRef="V__"&gt;</code>. For example in Toh 11, it spans to
                volume 32 at F.92.b: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <ref type="volume" cRef="V32"/>
                  <ref cRef="F.92.b" type="folio"/>
                </egXML>
                <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh11.html#UT22084-031-002-1029">See how this is displayed in Reading Room</tei:ref>
                                <lb/> *
                Usually the new volume will reset to F.1.b, but Toh 11 is a special case and continues with the numbering "F.92.b" on the first page of volume
                32. The volumes for the text will be marked in the <gi>location</gi>/<gi>volume</gi> element(s) in the located in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. </item>
              <item>There are some texts that are duplicated in multiple sections of the Kangyur. For example The Prophecy of Sri_Mahadevi is found twice in the
                Kangyur as Toh. 193 and 739. Theses are both word for word exactly the same, but the folio references are going to be different for each
                duplicate version of the text. So in this situation we just use one TEI file, "061-014_toh193,739" but the folio references are differentiated
                with the <att>key</att> attribute which will relate each individual <gi>ref</gi> to the corresponding <att>key</att> that is declared within
                that version's <gi>bibl</gi> element found in the TEI's initial <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. For example, in 061-014_toh193,739's <gi>sourceDesc</gi>:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <sourceDesc>
                    <bibl key="toh193" type="text">
                      <ref>Toh 193</ref>
                      <biblScope>Degé Kangyur, vol. 61 (mdo sde, tsa), folios 246.a–250.b</biblScope>
                      <author role="translatorTib">Unknown</author>
                      <location work="UT4CZ5369" count-pages="10">

                  </sourceDesc>
                </egXML> Then if you look at each individual folio references they will be differentiated by the <att>key</att> like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... <p tid="9">
                    <ref cRef="F.246.a" key="toh193" type="folio"/>
                    <ref cRef="F.230.a" key="toh739" type="folio"/> Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas. </p>
                </egXML> Now the parser will only display the appropriate folio references, e.g., when you click on Toh. 193 it will show the references for
                Toh. 193 but not those for 739 and vice-versa. Sometimes the page breaks between the folios will be in the same place in the eKangyur but often
                they are different so you may need to go in and find them all manually if they were not written in by the translator.</item>
              <item>As a final note on the subject of folio references, on rare occasions there are blank folio pages in the Degé appearing in the middle of
                texts. These blank pages will be matched with blank pages in the eKangyur; however, the reader generates a segment of preceding and following
                text from the nearest folio pages and this may be confusing to the reader when the folio reference is clicked in the web display. Therefore it
                is preferable to add a @rend="blank" attribute to any blank folios, which will suppress the link, and then add a note simply explaining that the
                page is blank. For example here is such a case in Toh 287: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> What difference is there <ref cRef="F.82.b" rend="blank" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-068-021-100028"/>
                                    <note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-068-021-102194">This folio of the
                    Degé Kangyur is blank.</note> ... </egXML>

                </list> In each of these cases, in order to avoid nesting errors the angular brackets will be transformed by the script into their escape codes

                  <item>1) modular passages, for now should just be replaced with comments, although just the tags themselves not their content, e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ＆lt;module starts＆gt;Knowing and seeing all,＆lt;module ends＆gt; </egXML> should be changed to

                any abbreviations section in the original docx. you can delete the abbreviations header but leave the section for notes. It should just look
                like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <div type="notes">
                    <head type="notes">Notes</head>
                  </div>
                </egXML>
              </item>
              <item>If the translator used Kangyur sigla in the notes but didn't create an abbreviations section, you may need to add one. See details for this
                in Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#ABBREVIATIONS-1"/>.</item>
              <item>Any formal lists or outlines within the text should be marked up with the <gi>list</gi> element, which must also have the <att>type</att>
                attribute with the value "section" or "bullet." "Section" should be used for longer items of text, and it will render them with some vertical
                spacing between each item. "Bullet" should be used for shorter items and will create some horizontal indentation (it isn't necessary for there
                to be actual "bullets" in the list, this is just what we have named it). These types can be used in any combination to create an outline. For
                further details on outlines and some examples see Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#OUTLINES_LISTS-1"/>. </item>
              <item>There may be times when a stanza of verse was missed and not placed into "verse" tags when being copy edited in the MS Word template. If
                that is the case you will notice each line of verse appearing in <gi>p</gi> tags rather than <gi>l</gi> tags. It is good to refer back to the
                original Word doc if you are in doubt, from there it should be clear according to the line breaks whether or not a stanza of verse was intended
                or not. </item>
              <item>Occasionally there may be tables in a document. For instructions on how to markup tables see Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#TABLES-1"/>.</item>
              <item>Check that all the <gi>div</gi> elements are marked up with the proper <att>type</att> attributes. See the documentation for the
                  <gi>div</gi> element to see the list of acceptable values. Note that a "prologue" or "colophon" should be marked as such and not as a
                "section." Also, each <gi>div</gi> should be accompanied by a <gi>head</gi> that has its own matching <att>type</att> attribute; however, there
                is one exception to this, &lt;div type="section"&gt; may be left without a <gi>head</gi> if the author did not provide one, this will usually be
                the case in the Introduction, Main Translation, or Bibliography whenever there is just one section and by default it is placed into a second
                level &lt;div type="section"&gt; wrapped within a first level &lt;div type="introduction"&gt; or &lt;div type="translation"&gt;. In this case
                the parser will read the <gi>head</gi>s from the main first level <gi>div</gi> and the second level &lt;div type="section"&gt; will not require
                an additional <gi>head</gi>.</item>
              <item>The script doesn't distinguish between chapters and sections, so the type value for all the "chapters" needs to be applied manually. Also,
                "chapter"s should contain a <gi>head</gi> type="chapter" element with some kind of enumeration, i.e., "chapter one," "chapter two," etc. If
                there is a formal title it should be contained in a <gi>head</gi> type="chapterHead" element following the first <gi>head</gi>. For example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <div type="chapter">

                    <head type="chapterTitle">The Teaching on the Nature of All Phenomena</head>

              </item>
              <item>Some texts have <gi>trailer</gi>s at the end of each chapter, for example in Toh. 11: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-031-002-1980"/>
                  <trailer tid="3216">This completes the twenty-second chapter from the <title xml:lang="en">Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand
                      Lines</title>, entitled “Cultivation.”</trailer>
                </egXML> Be default the script will convert every paragraph into a <gi>p</gi> element, so these <gi>trailer</gi>s should be manually applied if
                they appear at the end of each chapter. Please give each <gi>trailer</gi> its own milestone. </item>
              <item>All of the trailers will be separated by a space and italicized in their entirety by the parser, so any <gi>title</gi>s that appear in the
                trailer should be giving curled quotations marks. You will probably need to add these as the italicization could likely have been unnoticed in
                the copy editing phase. e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <trailer tid="1938">This concludes the first chapter, the introduction to the tantra, in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called “<title xml:lang="en">The Sole Hero</title>.”</trailer>
                </egXML>
              </item>
              <item>Some texts contain appendices. These will be located in the <att>back</att> section of the text. Usually the markup can be applied in the
                same way as in the main section, however, for Sanskrit Appendices (those that contain a Sanskrit edition of the text)see Appendix B Topics: <ptr target="#SANSKRIT_APPENDICES"/> for some further notes about marking up these sections.</item>
              <item>As you are working with the TEI texts, you may encounter various problems that require you to search for specific pieces of code or text
                within the markup. The XQuery/XPath Builder is a useful tool for searching for specific instances of text. See Appendix: <ptr target="#XPATH_SEARCH-1"/>, for further details on how to use the XQuery/XPath Builder. </item>

          <p>Milestones should be generated automatically by the script before every <gi>p</gi> element and <gi>lg</gi> element; however, we don't use
            milestones as uniformly as this, and many of the milestones will need to be taken out (For instructions on how to do this see Appendix: <ptr target="#GUIDELINES_MILESTONES-1"/>). It is important to do an actual visual check of the milestones as they appear in the web display. From the
            Reading Room, take the perspective of the reader; there should be enough milestones to map out the text, but they should not be distracting to the
            actual narrative of the text.</p>

            <label>
              <hi rend="bold">Web Display:</hi>
            </label>
            <p>First, we need to check to make sure the Folio References displayed on the web page are in alignment with the eKangyur. This require some minimal
              knowledge of Tibetan, so please have another editor check this for you if you don't know how to read Tibetan.</p>
            <p>When you check the web display, go to the main translation and click on a folio reference, e.g., "[F.100.a]." This should cause the eKangyur text
              to pop up. Make sure that the eKangyur page that pops up is the correct page that corresponds to the English translation. You don't need to go
              through every folio in the text, just check the first two folio refs and the very last one.</p>
            <p>Most likely they will already be aligned from the original placeholder data and a correction will not be needed. However, due to a blank page or
              error in the eKangyur the alignment of the pages might be off by one or more pages. The alignment may be adjusted in the
                <gi>location</gi>/<gi>volume</gi> element found in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>; here the <att>start-page</att> and <att>end-page</att> define the
              span of the folio alignment according to the pages numbers of the eKangyur.</p>
            <p>For texts that span two or more volumes, this will be defined by multiple <gi>volume</gi> elements and you should individual check the first and
              last folio for each volume. Then a &lt;ref type="volume" cRef="V_"/&gt; element needs to be added just before the first folio reference of the new
              volume. For example, Toh 11 spans two volumes: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <location work="UT4CZ5369" count-pages="788">
                  <volume number="31" start-page="414" end-page="593"/>
                  <volume number="32" start-page="2" end-page="611"/>
                </location>
              </egXML> and it jumps to volume 32 at F.92.b which is marked up as follows in the TEI: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <ref type="volume" cRef="V32"/>
                <ref cRef="F.92.b" type="folio"/>
              </egXML>

                            <lb/> *
              Note, usually the new volume will reset to F.1.b, but Toh 11 is a special case and continues with the numbering "F.92.b" on the first page of
              volume 32. </p>

              flag any anomalies. The anomalies will usually include the following: <list>
                <item> Occasionally there may be a missing folio reference. It could be that the translator missed it or due to some formatting error the
                  references were commented out or removed. </item>

                  there may be pagination differences between the Dege print the eKangyur is based on, <tei:ref target="https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W4CZ5369">W4CZ5369</tei:ref>, and the official Dege print we use and reference in our <gi>biblScope</gi>, <tei:ref target="https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W22084">W22084</tei:ref> (<tei:ref target="https://github.com/Esukhia/derge-kangyur#volume-numbers">Although the eKangyur uses the volume order from

                <item> Occasionally there may be anomalies reproduced from the original printed Dege, and <tei:ref target="https://github.com/Esukhia/derge-kangyur#page-numbering-issues">certain page numbers may have been skipped or duplicated for various

                <item> Occasionally there may be an error in the pagination found in the eKangyur. (These can be corrected in the source files. Ask Celso about
                  this). </item>
              </list> Any missing or erroneous folio references should be corrected (these flags should be in red). However, some of the flags will just not
              that the page number is logically out of alignment with the digital page order; e.g. the message, "Logically F.XXX.a/b" appearing next to the
              reference. This isn't necessarily a problem (which is why these flags are in yellow); it indicates that there is an anomaly between the logical
              page index in the digital file and the referenced folio number (the latter of which should correspond to the one displayed on the physical scan of
              the Tibetan source); usually because a folio number was skipped or there was a blank page in the Degé folio. Often the anomaly will originate on
              an earlier text in the same volume. So if you see these yellow flags, it's not necessarily a problem, but you should check to see if it originates
              in your text, and if so, that folios are aligned and displayed correctly with regards to that anomaly. For example, all the texts in vol. 90 are
              logically off by 1 page because there is a skipped folio page number on the first Tibetan folio of Toh 558. If you need to refer to the original
              scans, use the <tei:ref target="https://github.com/Celso-Scott/Glossary_Checker/blob/main/dege_kangyur_scan_checker-v3.html">scan checker</tei:ref> or

            you need to adjust, and the "page-offset" will adjust the alignment up with a positive
            integer or down with a negative one. It should only need to be adjusted by one or two
            pages, but if you need to reference the eKangyur it can be found in apps > eKangyur

                            <hi rend="bold">***Special Case for Volumes 81, 83, and 88 of the Degé Kangyur/eKangyur***</hi> There is a variation due to the addition of texts
              in the post <hi rend="italic">par phud</hi> printings, which includes our eKangyur in volumes 81, 83 and 88, which are not in the <hi rend="italic">par phud</hi> printing such as W22084. In volumes 81 and 83, this only concerns some texts added to the very end of the volume,
              but for volume 88 the Bodhimaṇḍasyālaṃkāralakṣadhāraṇī (byang chub snying po’i rgyan ’bum gyi gzungs) has the same Tibetan title as Toh 509, but a
              different Sanskrit title (Toh 509 is Bodhigarbhālaṃkāralakṣadhāraṇī). While this is confusing, it is also presumably the reason why the extra text
              was inserted at this point. If the orginal translator used a par phud printing this then off sets Volume 88 by 17 folios for all texts after Toh.
              508. Some points to address that should be addressed:</p>
            <p>(1) First be sure that both versions are stated in the <gi>biblscope</gi>. See this example from <tei:ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh526.html">Toh 526</tei:ref> this is the style that should be used as a template:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <biblScope>Degé Kangyur, vol. 88 (rgyud, na), folios 54.a–54.b (in <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">par phud</foreign> printings), 71.a–71.b (in later
                printings) </biblScope>
            </egXML>
            <p>(2) In this situation, because the folio references will not match up with those in the eKangyur, our solution has been to use both folio
              references. The one that links to the eKanyur will be the default <gi>ref</gi> element and the <gi>ref</gi> that refers to the alternate printing
              (likely W22084) should have this stated by a <att>work</att> attribute within the <gi>ref</gi> element. See for example from toh. 520: </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <ref cRef="F.41.a" work="W22084" key="toh520"/>
              <ref cRef="F.58.a" key="toh520" type="folio"/>
            </egXML>
            <p>Here in the web display both references will be visible but only the one without the "work" attribute will have a clickable link to the
              eKangyur.</p>
            <p>Please add a note after the first folio instance that explains this issue to the reader. If the text includes duplicates at different Toh
              numbers, then the note will need alternate messages, which are applied by <tei:ref target="https://exist-db.84000-translate.org/exist/webdav/db/apps/84000-data/tei/schema/current/84000_ODD.html#KEYS-1">using the @key

          <p>Typically the glossary should be included as a set of tables in the 84000 .docx template, and it will be converted into TEI through the main

          <p>Note that for the glossary to be converted properly the tables need to be labeled correctly and the columns of the glossary placed in the correct order;
            this should all be set up in the template, however, if you get weird results, double check that the tables were set up properly and make any corrections

              sheets aren't spelled exactly like this, then the script won't apply the correct <att>type</att> to the <gi>gloss</gi> elements.</item> 
                  <item>Each sheet/table needs to have seven columns that are to be exactly arranged as follows: (A) Tibetan Wylie, (B) Sanskrit, (C) Skt Source, (D) Chinese (optional), (E) Translation, (F)Definition, and (G) Alternatives.

            <list>
              <item>Edit the glossary. Note that when you save the file to the database it will add the “xml:id” automatically so you don’t need to worry about
                adding these. You will probably need to remove several empty <gi>item</gi> elements that were converted from empty cells at the bottom of each
                sheet. Also remove entries that were converted from the spreadsheet's headings i.e., Tibetan, Sanskrit, Translation, Definition, etc.</item>
              <item>If Chinese terms were in the fourth column of the table, those Chinese terms will be assumed to be Chinese characters and will be set to
                xml:lang="zh" by default. If they are actually romanized transliteration of Chinese then the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute should ="Zh-Ltn" </item>
              <item>Note that the database will also automatically generate Tibetan script and add it as a &lt;term xml:lang="bo"/&gt; element based on the
                Wylie glossary entries. The code should look within the glossary for any &lt;term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn"/&gt; and create the matching "bo" term
                wherever there isn't one. So be sure to save the file, close it, reopen, and check that the Tibetan entries have been properly added. </item>
              <item>Check for errors and make sure the tags are nested properly. Use a previously-edited 84000 TEI XML as a model. You might want to save it
                first so that it automatically adds all the attributes and so forth.</item>
              <item>If you used the spreadsheet, then by default the script will place all italics found in the definitions column into &lt;fix&gt; tags, and
                you will need to go in and change these into the proper tags and add the proper <att>type</att> and <att>xml:lang</att> attributes as needed.
                For the template these tags should all be generated according to the styles used within the template (or it will tag them with &lt;fix&gt; if
                any italics were missed).</item>
              <item>When it is documented, we are now documenting the source of the Sanskrit term (whether it came from a dictionary, source text, etc.) with a
                @type attribute. If these were noted in the glossaries 3rd column correctly, the type should be automatically be generated by the script. For
                further details see "Appendix C.2 <ptr target="#SANSKRIT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE-1"/>." </item>

              </item>
              <item>Often many spelling typos can slip through into the glossaries without even the editors being aware. The markup provides a final check to
                assure that spelling errors don't fall through and contaminate the cumulative glossary. You are in an apt position to do this because the script
                will generate Tibetan Unicode from the Wylie input and spelling errors are much easier to spot in the Tibetan script displayed from the reading
                room or glossary editing app. You can either check the entries Tibetan spelling now, or if you prefer do it when you look through the final web
                display (Step A.11), just please be sure to make a thorough check at some point in the markup process. There are two methods for checking the
                Tibetan spelling:</item>

            <list>
              <item>
                <label rend="bold">Method 1: The Glossary App</label>
              </item>
              <item>The Glossary App from Project Management is very helpful, and for shorter texts this is the easiest way to check that the terms are spelled
                correctly, by seeing their direct correspondence in the eKangyur. To open the Glossary App go to <tei:ref target="https://projects.84000-translate.org/index.html">Project Management</tei:ref> and select the "Edit Glossary" link next to the text.</item>
              <item>Unfortunately the Glossary App currently has a lot of lag and will not be efficient for larger texts. For larger texts, I suggest
                downloading the eKangyur text and searching it with a fast text editor that displays Tibetan Unicode (Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++). To obtain
                a digital eKangyur version of any text for searching in the text editor, go to <tei:ref target="https://utilities.84000-translate.org">Utilities</tei:ref> and click on the version that says "...bo.txt" for example, "toh83-bo.txt". I prefer to search the files with a line break at
                each folio ref and simplify the confusing tags. To do this enable regex search-and-replace in your text editor and use the following
                regex:</item>
              <item>
                <p>SEARCH:</p>
                <p>
                                    <code>{{page:{number:\d+,folio:(\d+[ab]),volume:\d+}}}</code>
                                </p>
                <p>REPLACE:</p>
                <p>
                                    <code>\n[f$1]</code>
                                </p>
              </item>
              <item>Go through every glossary item, if anything looks like it could be misspelled, or if you are not certain about the spelling of that term,
                check it against the eKangyur.</item>
              <item>
                                <hi rend="bold">Particles:</hi> Beware of misspelled particles; very often an incorrect case particle (དུ་ཏུ་སུ་-ར་ -- ཀྱི་གྱི་གི་-འི་),
                these are very easy for the editors to miss, and if they slip through they will create problems for the cumulative glossary, so if anything
                looks suspicious please double check it against the eKangyur.</item>
              <item>
                                <hi rend="bold">Archaic Spelling Forms:</hi> Occasionally there are archaic spellings or alternate spelling preserved in the eKangyur, so if
                something looks misspelled, please confer first with the Kangyur, as it does contain many unusual spelling forms that I assume we want to
                preserve. If the translator entered a more standard spelling in the Tibetan field, but only the archaic form appears in the Degé Kangyur, then
                you can add the archaic form as a second alternate Tibetan field. </item>
              <item>
                                <hi rend="bold">Tibetan Transliterated Sanskrit:</hi> It is very important to always check terms containing transliterated Sanskrit, as very
                often these will not have been entered with correct extended Wylie. As extended-Wylie is very precise, if anything is entered incorrectly, it
                will create gobbledygook in the Tibetan Unicode field. Often the translator has not used proper Wylie at all, and so all of the transliterated
                terms will need to be re-entered from the eKangyur. (By the way, this is not ideal, the translator may have consulted the Pedurma or other
                Kangyur editions when corroborating the spelling of glossary terms; if they did this but did not use proper extended-Wylie then that
                corroborative research will have to be thrown out and we will need to fall back on the eKangyur--either that or ask the translator to redo it.)
                Note that the easiest and laziest way to assure the extended-Wylie is correct is to paste the Tibetan Unicode into the <tei:ref target="http://www.thlib.org/reference/transliteration/wyconverter.php">THLib transliteration app</tei:ref>. It's good to forward this to any
                translators or editors that may be unaware.</item>

              </item>
              <item>Particularly with a large glossary, you might not have time to check every instance in the Glossary Editor, especially if there is lag.
                Another option is to use this python script which will check every &lt;term xml:lang="bo"&gt; against the Degé eKangyur and give you a list of
                any string that doesn't match anywhere in that specific eKangyur text.</item>
              <item>To run this script please follow the instructions in the following github repository: <tei:ref target="https://github.com/Celso-Scott/Glossary_Checker">Glossary Checker</tei:ref>
                            </item>
              <item>This python script is useful but it is not fail proof. Some terms may not match because an alternate Kangyur recension was used for the
                glossary field. Be vigilant against terms that are missing a letter at the very beginning or end of a string; for instance "སྐལ་བཟང" will not be
                flagged if it is actually "སྐལ་བཟངས" and just missing the final ས letter.</item>

            <list>
              <item>We have just begun the step of marking the glossary as "verified" if we have completely checked all the Tibetan spellings in the glossary.
                If you have done this with the python script, or by checking each and every entry in the Glossary Editor, go ahead and add @status="verified" to
                each and every &lt;term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn"&gt; field e.g. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" status="verified">shA ri’i bu</term>
                </egXML> Apply this to the Wylie field. You can do this by searching for: <code>&lt;term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn"&gt;</code> and replacing with
                  <code>&lt;term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" status="verified"&gt;</code>
              </item>
              <item>It is not absolutely necessary that the glossary be verified during markup. If because of time or other reasons a complete verification
                process could not be completed then forgo adding this "status" tag and move on to the next step.</item>

            <p>At this point all the basic editing for the Glossary should be complete. However, there is still some work to be done regarding how the glossary

              for in-text references or references to other 84000 texts are created with the <gi>ptr</gi> element and external references to other web pages are
              created with the <gi>ref</gi> element. However, links to Kangyur/Tangyur texts that are not yet published should be marked with a <gi>ref</gi> tag

            <item>It is also important to check the introduction and endnotes for any intext references to chapters or sections and add <gi>ptr</gi> tags

              folio references; unless these mentions are specifically referring to the Tibetan source text or the structure thereof, these folio references
              should be changed to the milestone numbers generated in the Reading Room -- according to what can be referenced most conveniently by the

            <item>The translator may have requested for some glossary entries to "use the standard definition" in the definition field. If this is the case
              apply the following: <list>
                <item>(1) Match the entry to the shared entity</item>
                <item>(2) Delete the definition field in the TEI or make sure it is completely blank (empty definitions will automatically display matched

                <item>(4) If the standard definition is requested but there is also contextual information to be included before the standard definition, both
                  may be displayed by opening the entry in the glossary editor, linking the entry to the appropriate entity and selecting as the definition
                  status "Compatible".</item>

                            <hi rend="bold">List Definitions to be Updated:</hi> While going through the glossary and assigning
              entities, make a running list of glossary entries with definitions that could be better updated to use the standard definition. There are such
              cases where a there is a low quality definition like, "The Blessed One -- An epithet of the Buddha." which could be updated to the standard one
              which provides more detail and explanation. Then list these entries in the Reading Room Worksheet to be reviewed by the editor at the end.
              Alternatively, the list could be placed in a google doc and sent to the editor separately if the list is long and that is deemed to be more
              convenient. </item>
          </list>
          <p>Note that we are trying to limit the proliferation of redundant definitions in the cumulative glossary, so if you spot that the translator has copy
            and pasted the standard definition, it would be best to delete the definition and simply link to the standard one. Occasionally, the translator may
            have copied the standard definition but reworded some terminology. If this is the case, use your own judgement to determine if it is
            possible/appropriate to reduce this to contextual information as a supplement the standard definition.</p>

              <p>Keep an Eye Out for Unwanted Blank Spaces. This is unfortunately an issue that occasionally occurs through the conversion scripts. It typically
                happens when multiple tags are set next to each other, such as the spaces between <gi>mantra</gi> tags and <gi>note</gi>s. Occasionally this
                will create an unwanted space that was not in the original Word doc. We are currently working on improving the scripts to resolve this and
                prevent these unwanted spaces from being generated, but in the meantime keep an eye out for extra spaces, particularly ones that appear after a
                  <gi>foreign</gi> or <gi>mantra</gi> tag and before a note or punctuation. </p>
              <p>For example see the unwanted spaces after the foreign term "mthong", and the ones before and after "khums" in the following example:</p>
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Here the imperative thong (“admit / release”), however, could easily be a scribal error for
                  <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mthong</foreign> , “behold.” KY, K, and N have the imperative “subsume!” ( <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khums</foreign> ). </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>It is helpful at this point to put the web page in “editor mode.” This underlines the linked glossary terms for you. Otherwise, in the regular
              display, it underlines them but then they will disappear after a few seconds, which will be frustrating when your are checking the links. An
              additional benefit of editor mode is that all of the collapsed sections of the text (Intro, Translation, Notes, etc...) will be expanded by
              default, so that you can more easily search for terms in the web display with CTRL-F. To put the page in editor mode, simply add the following
              text to the end of the URL web address: <code>?view-mode=editor</code>
            </item>
            <item>At this point you should check to see that the glossary is linking to the right terms. In the summary and introduction in particular there may
              be many instances of a word linking to the glossary when it shouldn’t, for example in the phrase “in terms of…” the word “term” might link to the
              glossary for the technical meaning of “term”; or to take another example, in the phrase “with respect to…” the word “respect” might link to
              “respect” as in devotion (these are just two out of many examples). Note, the translator guidelines [G4] instructs translators to flag instances
              of glossary terms that are only relevant to specific passages with the “†” symbol. They are also instructed to specify glossary entries as verbs
              (vb), nouns (n), or adjectives (adj) in cases where the glossary entry is only intended to link to one form of the word and not others, for
              example "play" or "appropriate". If they have done so then, don't leave these markers in the text, but replace them with the markup described in
              the following section. However, it is likely that a lot of these terms will be missed so you should also scan through the text in editor mode for
              any of these improperly linked terms.</item>
            <item>Also check that the highlighted terms correspond to their definition given in the Glossary. For example, although term ཁམས་ can refer to the
              18 dhatus, it can also sometimes refer to the 4 or 5 elements (earth, air, fire, water and space--although usually the term འབྱུང་པ་/པོ་ is used
              for this set). Both cases may be translated by the English word "element," but if the definition only mentions the 18 dhatus, then instances of
              the latter case of the 4 or 5 elements should not be linked.</item>
            <item>To fix these instances add the <tag>term rend="ignore"</tag> tag to the ones that should not be linked. Optionally the <att>mode</att>
              attribute may be added to the <gi>gloss</gi> element in the glossary. If the mode is set to mode="match" (this is the default mode, by the way),
              you will be able to block strings in the text you don't want to link by marking them with this <tag>term rend="ignore"</tag> tag. If you change it
              to mode="marked", it will only link with strings in the text that are tagged with the <gi>term</gi> element (you will need to mark each instance
              of the term individually in this case).</item>
            <item>In these cases you can save yourself some time when choosing between the "marked" or "match" modes. It is good to think about which mode will
              require the least amount of tags. Usually this will be the default "match" mode, but it varies from case to case.</item>
            <item>In some cases there may be three or more glossary entries with the same word. For example, if three people in the text have the same name. In
              this case, the instances may be distinguished using mode="marked" and adding @ref ids to all the instances of that name marked with a
                <gi>term</gi> element. <tei:ref target="84000_ODD.html#GUIDELINES_GLOSSARY-1">Please see Appendix C for details and examples of this.</tei:ref>
                        </item>
            <item>If there are any instances in the web display where there is a term in the glossary that is showing "0 instances in this text" (in the
              right-hand column of the glossary), you should find out if that term is actually in the text. There may be a spelling error, a diacritic error, or
              some other reason why it isn't linking to the glossary entry. Sometimes there is a glossary term that really isn't in the text (possibly because
              it was in the introduction and later removed). If this is the case make a note about it in the final list of questions and issues to address when
              you have finished the text.</item>
            <item>There are several subtle points for polishing the final glossary. In some cases alternatives may need to be added to link particular terms and
              in some cases the glossary terms will need to be checked against the original Tibetan. So we have created a separate Appendix C that explains how
              the glossary works, along with a few further tips for editing it. <tei:ref target="84000_ODD.html#GUIDELINES_GLOSSARY-1">Please take a look at

              In the colophon, <hi rend="italic">mkhan po</hi> should be translated as "preceptor" or "upādhyāya", but not as "teacher," "scholar," or "paṇḍita" 
              (although careful, sometimes it does say <hi rend="italic">paNDi ta</hi> in the source, in which case it is okay). Note that the translators often

                            <p>Make sure links aren't missing. Sometimes if the hashtag "#" is missing or misplaced in the "target" attribute in the <gi>ptr</gi>s then the
              reference won't appear at all and you will see text like "(see above, .)" without anything coming after it. Search for any instance of these using the regex pattern:</p>

                            <p>Check folio <gi>ref</gi>s inside <gi>mantra</gi>s. There is currently a rare bug where if there is a folio reference, e.g., &lt;ref
              type="folio"/&gt; inside a <gi>mantra</gi> element and that element is flush with the preceding <gi>p</gi> element, then the folio ref will not
              link in the reading room. For example:</p>
              <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;mantra&gt;This is a mantra. &lt;ref cRef="F.102.a" type="folio"/&gt;&lt;/mantra&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              <p>In this example the folio reference F.102.a will not display the eKangyur when it is clicked in the reading room. In this rare situation
                where they are directly next to each other (if there is any characters between them like a quote mark, space, or letter this problem doesn't
                occur), the fix for this is to simply put a single line break between the <gi>p</gi> and <gi>mantra</gi>. So from the example above: </p>
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <p>
                  <!--A line break is placed here in the XML-->
                  <mantra>This is a mantra. <ref cRef="F.102.a" type="folio"/>
                                    </mantra>
                                </p>
              </egXML> 
              <p>(This is a line break in the XML itself NOT an <gi>lb</gi> element). This will not alter the text in anyway as it appears in the reading
                room but it will fix the broken link for F.102.a to the eKangyur. To search for this issue you can simple search with this regular expression:</p>
              <p>
                                <code>&lt;p[^&gt;]+?&gt;&lt;mantra</code>
                            </p> 
              <p>This will find any <gi>mantra</gi>s flush against the <gi>p</gi> element, and you can add the line
                break or just ignore it if there is no <gi>ref</gi>s inside the mantra. This is an issue that you should check if there are any formatted mantras
                in the text. Eventually we will bring this up with eXist to fix this bug, but in the meantime this should be checked like this at the end of
                markup.</p>

            <item>
                            <p>For any links created with the <gi>ref</gi> element be sure that none of the links were accidentally set to forward the reader to a page on
              collaboration or in one of the editor view modes. This can be checked by doing a simple search for "view-mode" and
              "read.84000-translate.org":</p>

                <head>Search through the text and correct any erroneous straight apostrophes and quote marks. Note that the translator guidelines says to use
                  typographical apostrophes and quote marks (‘ ’ “ ”) not straight ones (' "). All Wylie Tibetan transliteration of the a-chung character should
                  use a right-curling apostrophe ’ not a left-curling one. One exception to this rule is for strings of Sanskrit transliteration which may use a
                  straight apostrophe ' to represent the avagraha character; this is allowed so long as it is done consistently. Otherwise straight apostrophes
                  should be avoided unless there is some pertinent reason to include them. These straight apostrophes and quotes are easy to miss and often can
                  slip unnoticed into our publications, so please run the following searches before submitting your final markup:</head>
                <item>(1) Check for straight apostrophes ' : This is easily done with a search-and-replace command for the ' character. Just make sure you check
                  each one, most of them will need to be replaced with right-curling apostrophes but some will need to be replaced with a left-curling
                  one.</item>
                <item>(2) Check for straight double quote marks " : This is a little trickier as straight quote marks are used in the XML tags. To find them in
                  the text and ignore all the tags open the CTRL/SHIFT/H, select "All open files" in the scope and search for the straight double quote " but in
                  the field that says "Restrict to XPath:" enter the code <code>//text()</code> this will search for the straight double quote only in the text
                  but not the tags.</item>

                <item>(4) Occasionally the unicode for a "modified word apostrophe" (U+02BC) may have been entered into the document. These look identical in
                  the Oxygen editor and in most fonts in general. However they display inconsistently with each other in the Reading Room and can interfere with
                  data searches in the Tibetan Wylie. Since this unicode has been depreciated in most word processors it is unlikely to occur, but you should
                  check for any (U+02BC)s by searching the following character: <code>ʼ</code> and all of these should be replaced with right curling single
                  quote marks (U+2019), which you can paste using this character here: <code>’</code> (They look the same but they are not. Notice with the
                  Unicode identifier at the bottom of the screen in Oxygen)</item>

              term in a language that hasn't been used in a published text yet, then that ISO 639-1 code may need to be added to the schema. In either case
              contact me about this (Celso) and I will add adjust the schema as needed.</item>
            <item>If the text is a large or complex text, it may be a good idea to check the original .DOCX for any "hidden" text. See Appendix <ptr target="#CHECK_FOR_HIDDEN_TEXT-1"/>.</item>

            <item>We have created a googlesheet to post and track any irregularities/inconsistencies between texts that may be a cause for concern. This is
              principally shared between the copy editors, but markup should feel free to report any issues that may be noticed in the markup process here: <tei:ref target="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16bOhdTBIhjrmaUnLgQAy30BkkT-AEdbbCXIy4AgqcVs/edit?usp=sharing">Irregularities in Published

                Tab on the Utilities Page</tei:ref>. You will find a link next to the text title that says "Run tests". Note these are the same tests that are
              performed from the "Tests" tab, but this "Run tests" link only performs them on the individual text (running tests on all the texts at once uses a
              lot of the server's resources so this should only be done when testing global updates). It the server will perform a series of tests and display
              the results. If any of the tests fail, click on that entry and it should display the explanation for the error. Most of these you should be able
              to resolve, but on occasion there may be an error that is difficult to diagnose or sometimes there is a unique anomaly causing the error and the
              test itself needs to be updated. In either case please notify the lead tech (dominic.latham@84000.co) about any of the test failures that can't be

            <p>At some point the glossary should be checked by an editor who has a qualified knowledge of Sanskrit. 
              Currently our go to is Wiesiek Mical (@wiesiek@84000.co) or Ryan Damron (@rdamron@84000.co).
              There are some project editors who are also sufficient with Sanskrit (David Fiordalis and Torston Gerloff) and a Sanskrit
              check will not be necessary if it is confirmed that the glossary has been checked by a qualified editor. 
              Otherwise, please send Wiesiek (or Ryan if Wiesiek is unavailable) an email asking them to review the Sanskrit terms 
              in the glossary once it is up on Collaboration. Please cc editorial and the project editor in this email, as they 
              should approve any changes that are needed to the Sanskrit glossary. That is to say send an email to the
              Sanskrit reviewer at the same time you request the project editor to review the outstanding issues in the RRWorksheet.</p>
            <p>
                            <hi rend="bold">Mark Sanskrit as Verified:</hi> If the Sanskrit is successfully verified, then as with the Tibetan terms, this should be marked
              in the TEI if time permits. Ideally, the Sanskrit check can be completed and all the terms can be updated at once with a search and replace
              searching for: <code>term xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"</code> and replacing with <code>term xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" status="verified"</code>

              <item>As you work on the text, make a running list of any problems or issues that you cannot fix yourself and make this into a final list of
                questions and issues. There are often a lot of things that come up: some of them should be addressed by the project editor. This list should be
                pasted into the <tei:ref target="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rcjhn4k4MixKAyogvAwxkxCVHG7avXn5W0WqhcYdkdw/edit?ts=5b802eba#gid=582485615">Reading Room Revisions spreadsheet, which you can access through this link</tei:ref>. There are several sheets within this document. Use the
                sheet entitled "Texts in Markup" and create a new heading for the text you are working on. There are also workflow instructions for how to post
                issues within the Reading Room Worksheet itself, at the very top of the first sheet under the "In Markup" tab.</item>
              <item>You may find solutions to these issues as you go, and if you just need your solutions or corrections to be checked by one of the editors,
                then assign the first "status" column with the orange label "check". Otherwise assign any new issues as "new".</item>
              <item>Most issues should be resolved by the project editor. However, should any technical or copyediting issues arise, then from the "Pending on"
                column you can assign this issue to the appropriate party to check: <list>
                  <item>Any copyeditor issues (spelling, grammar, and style issues) may be assigned to Laura (laura.goetz@84000.co), Konchog (konchog@84000.co),
                    or Dion (dionandon@gmail.com).</item>
                  <item>If the schema needs to be updated or there are markup issues, a new element or value (e.g., <att>xml:lang</att>) needs to be validated,
                    assign the issue to Celso (celso.wilkinson@84000.co).</item>
                  <item>For more technical issues to do with the parser or file generation, assign the problem to Dom (dominic.latham@84000.co)</item>
                  <item>In general we want to avoid burdening the editorial directors (John and Andreas), with editorial problems that could be resolved by the
                    project editors, but sometimes there may be some important issues that require a directorial decision. In such cases, first check with the
                    manager of publications, Mike (mike.engle@84000.co) and he will forward such issues to the directors as is necessary. </item>
                </list>
              </item>
              <item>When all the issues are listed in the RRWorksheet please email the project editor letting them know that the first round of markup is done,
                and you are ready for them to review the final issues in the worksheet. Please cc editorial@84000.co.</item>
              <item>At this point if you haven't had the Sanskrit glossary reviewed during step A.7.4, you should also send an email request to an editor with
                qualified Sanskrit expertise (Wiesiek or Ryan) to review the glossary. Please cc the project editor here as well for approval.</item>
              <item>As mentioned in the sheet's workflow instructions, you can assign issues to specific parties by making a comment and typing the "@" or "+"
                character, then selecting them from a drop down list. Or, if you prefer it's fine to just email that person directly. It's best to give a
                suggestion for how the issue may be resolved either from the "comments" column or by email if necessary.</item>
              <item>Occasionally, for issues that everyone may want to discuss, you can also notify or email one of the departments as a whole with the
                following groups: <list>
                  <item>84000-markup-editors@googlegroups.com -- address all markup.</item>
                  <item>84000-copyeditors@googlegroups.com -- all copyeditors.</item>
                  <item>all_editors@84000.co -- addresses all project editors (cc's John and Andreas for overview).</item>
                </list>
              </item>
              <item>As these issues are resolved please clean up your text's section in the review sheet. For anything that is fully resolved you can mark its
                status as "archive" and move it to the "resolved archive" sheet (or just delete it if it is inconsequential). If it seems to be an issue that
                may come up again and may be useful to reference in the future, you can also add it to the "reference archive" sheet.</item>
              <item>When all the final issues have been resolved or noted for the final review in the Reading Room Worksheet, notify the lead markup editor; the
                markup will be reviewed one more time them and then they will update the status to "2", ("Markup Completed, and awaiting final proofing before
                release").</item>
              <item>If there are any parts of this TEI editor's checklist that need to be clarified or updated you can contact Celso to make those updates. You

          <p>When it's time to publish the text:</p>
          <list>
            <item>The mark-up editor takes a final review of the text before pushing to distribution. Once they deem it is ready, they enter into "Edit Headers"
              in Project Management for the specific text. The mark-up editor then changes the text status to "1a" (it's been published, but not yet in the
              app); adds the correct publication date to the current date; changes the version number to 1.0.0; adds “First published version” under the “Note
              about this version”; and under “Progress Notes” writes “First published November 11 2021” for example. The markup editor then presses update to
              save all of those changes.</item>
            <item>Markup should now run the automated tests from utilities (just for that single text, don't run the tests for all the texts)</item>
            <item>Be sure the cache is updated to the latest version, otherwise click on "generate new cache (glossary tool)" from project management. This is
              important for the epub and pdf to cache the glossary and notes properly.</item>
            <item>The markup editor then selects the option in Project Management “Generate associated files” to generate the pdf and ebook files subsequently
              checking they were properly generated notifying Dom of any issues. This involves manually checking each file generated to make sure they layout
              and formatting is correct. They also regenerate the cache using the link in Edit Headers.</item>
            <item>Once the files are correctly generated the markup editor should go to the utilities app on the distribution server
              (https://utilities.84000.co/translations.html). Search for the text by Toh number. Now click on "Get all updated files", this will push the
              publication to distribution.</item>
            <item>Take a look at the text on distribution and check to make sure the text is displaying correctly and is readable. For most texts this check can
              be pretty quick, but if there was any unusual formatting in the text, e.g. tables, irregular folio mapping, complex divisions; please check these
              as well in the reading room and various file formats to make sure that everything is generating properly. </item>
            <item>Announce that the text has been published on the Whatsapp group "84000 editorial team"--please also provide a link to the published text. The
              publication is now completed in terms of the markup editors responsibilities. From here, Line will see that the text has been published
              according to the whatsapp announcement and Line will prepare the text for public announcement. </item>
            <item>As a last step, on the Jira board, please move the card for that text from the "In Review" column to the "Pre-Release" column. Assign the card
            to the glossary lead (André) who will then proceed to do a final review of the integration of the text's glossary with the cumulative
            glossary. When the glossary is integrated, the glossary lead will remove the @status="excluded" from the glossary (<gi>div</gi> element) and update
            the version to activate the integration. The glossary lead will then move the Jira card to "Released".</item>

          <label rend="bold" xml:id="ITALICS-1">Italics</label>
          <p>In a given text, words or phrases may be italicized for different reasons. The need to express both presentation information (that text is
            italicized) as well as the semantic information about why it is italicized must be addressed. That is why instead of simply using the <gi>hi</gi>
            element, for example, the voices below form the markup menu for text that needs to be italicized: </p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <gi>distinct</gi> terms, words, or phrases singled out (in any language, but use this only when a "foreign" tag is not applicable).</item>
            <item>
              <gi>emph</gi> words or phrases italicized for emphasis or rhetorical effect. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign xml:lang=""</tag> foreign words or phrases in any language.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="term" xml:lang=""</tag> a foreign term or phrase other than a quote or title, such as a term or phrase in parentheses following
              its translation, or a foreign term or phrase left untranslated. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>title xml:lang=""</tag> title of a work (in any language). </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign xml:lang="__-Ltn"</tag> Wylie or other type of Roman transliteration (excluding European languages, which should not have the "-Ltn"
              appendage). </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="quote" xml:lang=""</tag> quotations from other texts. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>mantra</tag> should be used to italicize complete mantras, however this is a bit more complex because some parts of mantras maybe translated
              into English. See Appendix B.6 <ptr target="#MANTRAS-1"/> for more about how to markup mantras. </item>
          </list>
          <p>Note that sometimes there may be some overlap between what distinguishes the italics tag used for a “term” vs. a “quote.” In such cases you can use
            your own discretion, but in general italics used for a “term” are for specific a word or phrase that is left un-translated usually because it is
            technical, untranslatable, or for some other reason. In contrast the italics used for a “quote” are for italics used for a word or phrase citing a
            specific instance in a source text either to corroborate the English translation, or to note some difference between two or more sources. Both tags
            are rendered the same in the end, so this isn’t a critical call to make. There is no need spend time looking up italics to determine whether or not
            they are found in sources, but just keep this general principle in mind when distinguishing the proper tag for italics. </p>
          <p>Note that Tibetan script and Chinese characters should be given the xml:lang value of "bo" and "zh" respectively, while Tibetan, Chinese, and
            Sanskrit romanized transliteration should have the values of "Bo-Ltn," "Zh-Ltn," and "Sa-Ltn" respectively. For other languages use the list of <tei:ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1 codes</tei:ref> to find the appropriate xml:lang value. Most often an Asian
            language will be translated into the Roman script and, therefore, the first letter of the ISO 639-1 code should be capitalized followed by "-Ltn".
            Thus a Thai term "th" in Romanized script should be coded "Th-Ltn." If the term is a European language or the native script of that language is
            used, then use the two letter code as usual, e.g., "fr" (French), "la" (Latin), etc.</p>
          <p>For the most part, these tags should be added during the copy editing phase in the 84000 Template.docx. In this phase they will be added as styles
            in MS Word, but will be transformed into the appropriate tag by our scripts. However, as we can't add a style for every language in the template,
            the markup editor will need look up and edit the tags for any uncommon languages, which will be marked through the script as xml:lang="Input
            Language." The markup editor should also keep an eye out for errors, or italicized text that was missed. However, the script should render all
            unmarked italics with a "&lt;fix&gt;" tag, which will be highlighted as an error by the schema.</p>
          <label rend="bold" xml:id="BOLD-1">Bold, Underline, and Other Font Styles</label>
          <p>We typically don't use bold and underline very often, but they may be necessary for various semantic reasons:</p>
            <list>
              <item>The <gi>label</gi> element, will render text bold, but this should be used only for labels in lists or outlines. Otherwise,</item>
              <item>Use the <gi>hi</gi> element to add "bold", "underline", "line-through", "small-caps", "superscript", or "subscript" as the @rend value 
                to change the font style as needed.</item>
              <item>The <gi>emph</gi> element can also take a @rend attribute to add "bold", "underline", or "line-through" in combination with italics, 
              which <gi>emph</gi> renders by default.</item>
              <item>See examples in <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh00.html?view-mode=editor#UT22084-000-000-550">the layout checks here</ref>.</item>

              chapters by the translator. Section is used for equivalent level sectioning that has not been called a chapter. Examples for the latter are
              sectioned bibliographies, where the whole of the bibliography has multiple sections organized by source type. In that case <tag>div
                type="section"</tag> is used instead of <tag>div type="chapter"</tag>. From a structural point of view, however, they are the same.</p>

            <head>Changing the Chapter Numbers</head>
            <p>Occasionally, for whatever reason the chapter numbers may need to be altered. <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">For example in Toh 543</tei:ref>, many chapters are skipped since a
              Sanskrit source was matched to the chapters in the Kangyur. The number needs to be displayed as such in the header but also needs to have the
              proper number prefixed in the table of contents and all the milestones contained within the chapter, all of which will be diverging from the
              number that is automatically generated by the parser. This can be done by adding a single @prefix attribute to the appropriate chapter's
                <gi>div</gi> element. e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <div type="chapter" prefix="24">
                  <!--...-->
                </div>
              </egXML> So <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">this chapter and all its milestones will now display
                the "24" prefix in the reading room</tei:ref> even though it isn't the 24th "chapter" division in the TEI file. </p>

          <head xml:id="OUTLINES_LISTS-1">Outlines and Lists</head>
          <p>Sometimes the introduction of a text will provide an outline, particularly in the case of a longer or more complicated text. Within the TEI XML
            these outlines should be constructed using the <gi>list</gi> and <gi>item</gi> elements. For a complex outline with many levels of subsections, the
            outline itself should be contained in a list, and each section should be contained in an <gi>item</gi> within that list. Then, for each sub section,
            a new <gi>list</gi> element should be nested within those <gi>item</gi>s, which in turn contains its own subsections with <gi>item</gi> elements,
            and so forth for as many subsections as necessary. Note that if the <gi>list</gi> is marked up as type="bullet" it will be indented. A good way to
            render the outline in a clear way is to mark up the first list as type="section" and all subsequent lists as type="bullet"; then the major sections
            will be separated by vertical spacing and all the subsections will be indented. <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh116.html#UT22084-051-004-45">For an example see the following outline from "The Baskets

          <p>This will allow the outline to be properly displayed in the 84000 reading room. For more simple outlines that have a one-level list, use the

            the items are longer sections of text (<tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-031-002.html#UT22084-031-002-36">see also
              Toh. 11 here</tei:ref>). The "bullet" and "section" types can be used in alternation however they are needed, just note that "section" will have
            vertical spacing between each item, and "bullet" will be indented.</p>
          <p>The <gi>head</gi> element resting within the <gi>list</gi> tag, but outside of the <gi>item</gi> tag can be used to create a bold heading at the

                      bodhisattvas, all fruitional attributes manifested by buddhas, and all attainments up to and including omniscience. along with
                      unconditioned phenomena, such as the abiding nature of all things and the finality of existence, these are all attributes with respect to
                      which a great bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment. Bodhisattvas do perceive such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative
                      level; in an ultimate sense they consider them to be illusory, in the manner of a dream and so forth. </p>

                <p>Cross references in the text that refer to milestones will be added using a <gi>ptr</gi> element with the "target" attribute. The value of
                  the target should be a hashmark ("#") followed by the xml:id value of the milestone that is to be linked. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> See <ptr target="#UT22084-060-005-1"/><!--2.3-->. </egXML> The milestone number as it appears on
                  the web page may be listed as a comment afterwards, but it should not be entered as text as the parser will automatically show the milestone
                  number in the web display. This way even if the milestones shift around it will still display and link to the correct milestone on the web

                <p> One important point about adding references to the introduction: When you mark up introductions with internal <gi>ptr</gi> references to the
                  translation, replace any Degé folio references (e.g F.108.a) with milestone references. For most readers that will make much more sense. Of
                  course the translators have no choice, because at the time they put such cross-references in there are no milestones.</p>
                <p>If you can’t identify exactly the passage and its milestone, you can leave it as the folio reference, and ask the editors to make the change
                  during the final proofing. And, of course, if the reference is really all (and only) about a Tibetan passage in the source text, and the
                  translation is irrelevant, a folio reference makes more sense. </p>

                                    <gi>ptr</gi> links should be used to link to other 84000 texts as well. Previously we used <gi>ref</gi> tags, but in 1/1/2023 we updated the

                <p>If there is a link to an external website, then a <gi>ref</gi> tag should be used with the URL of that website indicated as the target. For
                  example:</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Kyoto: Educational Department of the West Hongwanji, 1924. <ref target="http://web.mit.edu/stclair/www/smaller.html">web.mit.edu</ref>
                </egXML>
                <p>Note that hyperlinks in the original MS Word .docx should go through the XSLT script and be outputted in this form.</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <p>Note, if there is an ampersand "&amp;" in the url address this will be read incorrectly in the TEI. The ampersand character itself should be
                  replaced by the ampersand character code "&amp;amp;". The link should now work properly.</p>
              </item>
              <item>Previously we used this tag for links citing other 84000 texts. This functionality is still active, however it is preferable to use
                  <gi>ptr</gi> tags because the displayed milestone will automatically updated if the numeration changes in the cited text. However, for any
                pending links to unpublished 84000 texts, the <gi>ref</gi> tag needs to used instead of the <gi>ptr</gi> tag (see below).</item>

              <item>
                <p> When another Kangyur/Tengyur text is referenced that has not yet been published, the editors have been instructed to enter a coded comment
                  in the form: <code>&lt;Reference Toh ####&gt;</code>, sometimes with the folio reference added when it is specified. Of course, you should
                  check to see if the text has been published in the meantime, but if it is still pending, then we should mark the link with a <gi>ref</gi> tag
                  containing the @rend="pending" attribute. This will suppress the link making it inactive, but it will be flagged by our apps when the text is
                  published. However it is important that the correct URL for the unpublished text is entered in the @target attribute so that our apps will
                  pick it up. The URL will follow this form <code>https://read.84000.co/translation/toh[ENTER TOH NUMBER HERE].html</code>. Here is an example
                  of a link to a Tengyur text found in the bibliography of Toh 185: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                <p>This is the format to use for all general links to unpublished texts, in which the link will eventually open to the title page of the texts.
                  However, in cases where a specific section of that text is mentioned, which should usually indicated by a folio page reference, the folio
                  reference or other instruction for locating the specitic citation should be added to the <gi>ref</gi> tag in an @inst attribute. For example:
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <note place="end">This sūtra is quoted by Nāgārjuna in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">

                  </egXML> Then when Toh 3934 is published. This <gi>ref</gi> tag will be called and the @inst attribute will instruct markup to locate the
                  appropriate milestone and add it with a hashtag to the URL. e.g.
                    <code>https://read.84000.co/translation/toh3934.html#UT22084-999-999-9999</code>.</p>

                <p>We don't need to be obsessive about these comments marking up every possible nuance of a reference to another text, but we should think from the

            <list>
              <item>Often texts will cite Dunhuang texts. These texts are referenced using the IDP's abbreviations, e.g."IOL Tib J 149", "IOL Tib J 705", etc...
                The page for the specific text can be found by <tei:ref target="http://idp.bl.uk/">entering the abbreviation directly into the IDP's search bar
                  here</tei:ref> (on the left side where it says "Search the IDP Database"). You should check that the page exists and if it is publicly available.
                However there is an issue with linking directly with this page. If you open the page it will use an URL with an id number in it such as
                  <code>http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_scroll_h.a4d?uid=1846009887;bst=1;recnum=5001;index=1;img=1</code> It seems the part of the URL "uid"
                shifts so this link will become dead. Instead this alternative URL should be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=[ENTER THE IDP ABBREVIATIION HERE];img=1 </egXML> So for example if you want to link to "IOL Tib J
                149", then use this URL <code>http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL Tib J 149;img=1</code>. This will ensure the link remains stable.
                For an example, see <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh196.html#link-to-UT22084-061-016-78">this note, n.35 from TOH

          <head xml:id="TABLES-1">Tables</head>
          <p>Occasionally translators may present a table in their translation. Tables can be used anywhere in the text or even contained within an endnote. The
            XSL script should be equipped to convert tables from the DOCX document to the TEI XML; however, attributes need to be applied to the
            <gi>table</gi>s, <gi>row</gi>s, and <gi>cell</gi>s manually (see for example the <att>role</att>="label" attributes found in the <gi>row</gi>s in
            the XML sample below). Also each table should be checked against the original DOCX to assure that there weren't any errors in the conversion
            process. So far there have note been many tables in 84000 publications but here is one example from <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh361.html#link-to-UT22084-077-002-623">TOH 361</tei:ref>: </p>

                        <tei:ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh361.html#link-to-UT22084-077-002-623">(See how this example is displayed in reading
              room.)</tei:ref>
                    </p>
          <p>As you can see a <gi>table</gi> contains an optional heading and a series of <gi>row</gi>s. Each <gi>row</gi> in turn contains a series of
              <gi>cells</gi> representing the way they are to be rendered from left to right. Add the very bottom of the table after the final <gi>row</gi>, any
              <gi>note</gi>s may be placed here regarding the table itself. In the example above there are three such <gi>note</gi>s marked by asterisks. These
            are not endnotes, as they do not have the <att>place</att>="end" attribute, so they will be rendered at the bottom of the table rather than becoming
            additional endnotes. Optionally, paragraphs <gi>p</gi> may be placed at the bottom of the table in a similar manner, still within the <gi>table</gi>
            but after the final <gi>row</gi>.</p>
          <p>Currently there is no need to distinguish how the table should be rendered, but as this becomes necessary, any rendition information should be
            supplied using the global <att>rend</att> attribute, at the table, row, or cell level as appropriate. Currently no <att>type</att> is being used,
            but this may be added to the schema and documentation when it becomes necessary. Cells and rows should be assigned <att>role</att>="label" if they
            are considered to be the label or heading in which the subsequent <gi>cell</gi>s are considered to be data relevant to that label. If a <gi>row</gi>
            contains the <att>role</att>="label" attribute, then all of its child <gi>cell</gi>s will be considered to be "label"s as well. These labels will be
            rendered in bold type in the HTML web display.</p>
          <p>Note, when marking up <gi>table</gi>s the markup editor should check that the table renders properly in the reading room's web display. In
            addition, the table needs to be checked in the ebook display as well. This can be done by adding the code: <code>?viewmode=epub</code> to the very
            end of the url address on the utilities page. In truth, the tables are not compatible with the ebook format, so the parser will instead display them
            as a bulleted list. The information in this list should be presented in a complete and eloquently readable way, otherwise the parser should be
            updated.</p>

          <head xml:id="MANTRAS-1">Mantras</head>
          <label rend="bold">Documenting all mantras with <gi>mantra</gi> tags.</label>
          <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">*** Important note: Every mantra should be tagged with a <gi>mantra</gi> tag. The @rend="manta" in the parent <gi>p</gi>
            or <gi>lg</gi> element does not count as a mantra tag; it only functions to indent the paragraph for a mantra that is set apart as its own paragraph.</hi>
                    </p> 
          <p>The purpose of the <gi>mantra</gi> tag itself is two-fold: (1) We want to document every complete instance of a mantra for our database, and (2)
            the mantra tag will create italics for mantras that are left in their original language and not translated into English.
            However, occasionally there will be mixed mantras (xml:lang="mixed"), which partially translated into English with leftover
            fragments of foreign italicized terms in the form of seed syllables or untranslatable words (Hung! Phet! etc...). 
            Therefore, the italics will be generated by the parser
            according to the <att>xml:lang</att> attributes in the mantra element: if the value is "en" or "mixed" the mantra won't be italicized, but with any
            other language value all the text within the <gi>mantra</gi> tag will be italicized. In the case of a mixed translated English/Sanskrit mantra, the
            Sanskrit fragments within the parent <gi>mantra</gi> need to be additionally marked up with &lt;foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"&gt; elements in order to
            render the italics. See examples below in "a. General Scenarios." </p>
          <label rend="bold">Tagging mantras with styles in MS Word</label>
          <p> To help stream line this process the mantras will be partially marked up by styles converted from the copyeditor template in MS Word, however
            because MS Word can't layer multiple character styles, we can't tag the foreign fragments and the mantras at the same time. To resolve this
            conundrum, we have come up with the following solution: If the mantra is full and complete in one language, it can be tagged with the appropriate
            style in the template, but if the mantra is mixed, then just the italicized fragments should be tagged with a "Fragment-in-MixedMantra" style. This
            will in turn create a <gi>foreign</gi> element that contains a <att>type</att>="FragmentinMixedMantra" attribute. Then since "FragmentinMixedMantra"
            is not a valid type value in our schema it will show up as an error, which will signal you to wrap the whole mantra in a &lt;mantra
            xml:lang="mixed"&gt; tag. Finally after these mixed mantras have been wrapped in &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt; tags from their beginning to end,
            all of the type="FragmentinMixedMantra" attributes can be removed with the refactoring tool: Within the Tools --&gt; XML Refactoring tool, use the
            "Delete Attribute" opperation, then for element enter in: <code>mantra/foreign[@type="FragmentinMixedMantra"]</code> and for the attribute enter in:
              <code>type</code> This will insure that only the <att>type</att> attributes will be removed that have the value "FragmentinMixedMantra" and it
            will also only remove those of <gi>foreign</gi> elements within <gi>mantra</gi>s, this way it will ensure that all of them have first been properly
            wrapped in &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt; elements. </p>
          <label rend="bold">Placing some mantras in indented blocks.</label>
          <p> In terms of style, whenever there is a formally declared mantra, it will often be placed into an indented block paragraph. This is not configured
            by the <gi>mantra</gi> tag, but rather by adding a <att>rend</att>="mantra" attribute to the parent <gi>p</gi> or <gi>lg</gi> element which is to be
            rendered as an indented block by the parser. However, this will not always the case, depending on the length, frequency, and context of the mantra,
            the translator and/or copy editors may wish to place the mantras in regular paragraphs or verses. This is a stylistic choice that will vary from
            case to case. All of the <att>rend</att>="mantra" attributes will be created by the script wherever the "Mantra-Block" or "Mantra-Block-Verse"
            paragraph style is used within the copyeditor's template. So in general, this will be dealt with in the copyediting phase and markup editors will
            not need to apply these <att>rend</att> attributes, but you should be aware how this markup works. </p>
          <label rend="bold">Dhāraṇis and seed syllables.</label>
          <p>Seed syllables that are mentioned in the text for the purposes of visualization or explanation should also be marked up as <gi>mantra</gi>s, but
            they need to be distinguished with the <att>type</att>="syllable" attribute (see example below a.iv).</p>
          <p> For all dhāraṇis, that is if a string or phrase is declared to be a dhāraṇi by either the text itself or the translator, then these should be
            tagged in the same way, but a <att>type</att>="dharani" attribute should be added to the <gi>mantra</gi> element. Currently "dhāraṇi" styles have
            not been added to the template, instead copy editors are informed to make a comment whenever dharanis are present. The markup editor need to add the
            appropriate <att>type</att>="dharani" so be sure to keep an eye out for this while going through the mantras in the XML. There are also some mantras
            self described as "vidyā", "vidyāmantra", "secret mantra", etc. in some texts (see Toh 270, 543) which can be tagged in the same way. </p>

                complete sentence and sometimes spans more than one sentences so it makes sense to include them for consistency. However, if the mantra is
                entirely in Sanskrit, then this punctuation should be excluded if possible. Quotations at the boundaries of the mantra should be excluded from
                the tag wherever possible.</p>

                  "vidyā mantra" "secret mantra" (only used the latter when it was distinguished in the same text from other "mantra"s). At some point we could
                  ask a specialist in the topic about which classifications are necessary or useful and update our markup as such.</p>

            leave such terms linked when the mantra has been translated into English. Know that in either case, @rend="ignoreGlossary" will block the entire

          <p>Typically, the homage preceding just before a mantra should not be included in the mantra tag nor the indented paragraph. This can sometimes be
            confusing since separate homages sometimes appear as part of the mantra proper. All of this should be worked out earlier in the workflow by the
            editors and copy editors, but in case you need to confirm this, here are some guidelines concerning the mantras and their homages given by Wiesiek
            Mical:</p>
          <p>Most of the time there is no ambiguity. There are three things to look for when deciding whether the homage is part of the mantra or not, each of
            the three usually sufficient on its own to decide:</p>
          <list>
            <item>1) The presence of tadyathā. If it is there, then the homage that precedes it is not part of the mantra, as in this mantra of Mahāśvetā (all
              examples quoted below are from the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa): <lb/>
              <hi rend="bold">Sanskrit Source:</hi>

            </item>
            <item>2) But the tadyathā is not always there, as in this heart mantra of Mañjuśrī: <lb/>
              <hi rend="bold">Sanskrit Source</hi>

                <p rend="mantra" tid="51">“<mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Oṁ maṁ</mantra>!”</p>
              </egXML>
              <p>
                                <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh52.html#UT22084-088-038-61">See in Reading Room</tei:ref>
                            </p> It is almost a rule
              (exceptions are few) that the homage begins with namaḥ, and the mantra that follows it begins with oṁ, so the oṁ will usually marks the beginning
              of the mantra. </item>
            <item>3) The third criterion to go by is that the homage addresses the buddhas (or the buddhas and bodhisattvas) in general, whereas the mantra
              addresses the deity—both examples given above make this clear, even though, in the second, Mañjuśrī is not addressed by name. <lb/> The above
              three criteria may be used to decide that the homage is not part of the mantra. So how to know when the homage is part of the mantra? <lb/> The
              main criterion is that the homage in such cases will typically begin with oṁ and address specifically the deity of the mantra (not the buddhas in
              general). This is illustrated by the example quoted by Celso—Oṁ, homage to Cakravartin, the invincible uṣṇīṣa of the tathāgatas, invisible at the
              top of their head, (oṁ namo • apratihata­tathāgatoṣṇīṣāya • anavalokita­mūrdhni cakra­varti)—where the homage addresses the uṣṇīṣa king
              Cakravartin, i.e. the deity that this mantra is invoking. The homage is therefore part of the mantra. <lb/> Even if the oṁ is missing (due to
              textual corruptions?), if the homage specifically addresses the deity, it still should be treated as part of the mantra: <lb/>
              <hi rend="bold">Sanskrit Source</hi>

          <head xml:id="ABBREVIATIONS-1">Abbreviations Section</head>
          <p>As for when Kangyur abbreviations should be used here is a note from John:</p>
          <p>I see this as needing an adapted approach, depending on the number and kind of notes, in several steps:</p>
          <list>
            <item>1) I think in texts where there aren’t many notes about variants in different Kangyurs — let’s say a maximum of about 10 notes — it's probably
              easier for our readers if we simply spell out “Degé Kangyur” or “Stok Palace Kangyur” each time.</item>
            <item>2) If there are more notes than that, but they almost all refer to one Kangyur, we could say “Degé Kangyur” the first time and just “Degé” in
              subsequent mentions, and an abbreviations list is unnecessary.</item>
            <item> 3) If there are quite a lot of notes and they refer to several different Kangyurs, or the Chinese, Sanskrit versions, etc., then we should
              definitely have an abbreviations list and use the sigla alone in all such notes. </item>
          </list>
          <p>This should be covered by the editors, but they may not have created an abbreviations section. If there are a lot for sigla used in the notes
            (situation 3 above), but there is not abbreviations section, then please create one modeled on other texts.</p>
          <p>When the abbreviations for alternative Kangyur editions are used, you should <tei:ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">follow the Vienna system</tei:ref>.</p>
          <p>Sigla with supscript letters should use the &lt;hi rend="subscript"&gt; tag, using the matching case used in the official sigla, e.g., <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">K<hi rend="subscript">Y</hi>
                        </egXML>. </p>

          <p>The headings, <gi>head</gi>, are used in the same manner as within the body of the text, and use the same possible @type attributes as is

          <list>
            <item>If it is a Sanskrit Appendix the initial heading should be labeled "Sanskrit Text" and then any sub headings may be labeled appropriately as
              chapters, sections, etc.</item>
            <item>To distinguish between the numbers in the appendix's chapter headers from those in the main translation add an "-A" to each number, e.g.,
              "Chapter A1", "Chapter A2"...</item>
            <item>Often the translator will have typed untagged milestones into the Sanskrit appendices. If possible we would like to arrange our own
                <att>milestones</att> so that the milestone index generated in the reading room by the parser match up with these, and then the original
              milestones from the word doc may be commented out. For example <tei:ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh437.html#UT22084-081-006-274">see
                Toh 437</tei:ref>, and if you look in the original TEI you will see the orginal milestones in the appendix have been commented out. However, there
              are some cases when this will not be possible because some complexity in the correlation. This was the case in <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh543.html#appendix">Toh 543</tei:ref> where the text was translated from a Sanskrit
              manuscript in which chapters omitted in the Tibetan were skipped. In this case the final milestones were left in as is, and an explanation was
              added in the appendix's prologue.</item>
            <item>Note, that often there will be entries in the glossary that may be Sanskrit names or terms that also appear in the Sanskrit appendix. However
              since these won't be linked consistently due to Sanskrit's complex spelling declinations, we generally want to avoid linking the Sanskrit body of
              the appendices all together. This can be done by adding an @rend="ignoreGlossary" attribute to either the <gi>p</gi> or <gi>div</gi> elements you
              would like to be blocked. Ostensibly there will be terms in the English prologue/introduction to the appendix that we would won't to link, so
              these @rend attributes can be applied and adjusted according to the need.</item>

The titles are distinguished with @keys in <gi>title</gi>s
                in the titleStmt, sometimes in the intro, and in the <gi>head</gi> of the body of the text. Note that the Kangyur catalog in the 84000 reader,
                under each Toh number, it will display any titles that are found in the <gi>titleStmt</gi> with non-matching @keys as alternative titles for

                <gi>mantra</gi>: Occasionally, there will be entirely different content or omitted content found between two versions that editorial has decided

Be mindful that any <gi>note</gi>
                inside a <gi>p</gi> that is excluded in one version will likewise be omitted in that version, but it can be replaced by adding a note to a
                separate <gi>p</gi> element matched to the other text(s). This was done for instance in <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh1777.html#UT22084-101-146-178">n.7 of Toh 1090/1777</tei:ref>; you can refer to the TEI of

                containing the @key. A single note can also be given child <gi>p</gi> elements that have separate @keys to make the note display something
                different in each version. This is commonly done for instance to state the Vol. 88 folio discrepancy for Vol. 88 texts with multiple
                versions:</p>

                It would be ideal to avoid this, especially in a text under a singular title (so they don't end up citing the note of one version that is a
                different index in another). This issue could be avoided by having parallel notes in respective versions that explain differences from the
                parallel version. Please be sure that editorial is aware of this issue if the final published text is going to have note numbering that doesn't
                match.</p>

          <head>Chinese and Other Foreign Scripts</head>
          <p>Chinese scripts need to always be tagged with a @xml:lang="zh" if they are in Chinese script, e.g. "漢語拼音", and be tagged @xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" if they
            are in pinyin or other Roman transliteration e.g. "Hànyǔ Pīnyīn". They may be tagged with the @xml:lang attribute either with a <gi>foreign</gi> or
              <gi>title</gi>, or a <gi>div</gi> element in the case of a Chinese Summary (Chinese summaries should be placed immediately after the English
            summary in its own separate <gi>div</gi> with an @xml:lang="zh" attribute. It will not be displayed in the English Reading Room but will on the
            Chinese site). If they are not tagged like this they will not be displayed correctly in a consistent font. The same goes for any Japanese text,
            which should be tagged "ja" or "Ja-Ltn" in the same manner. There is one exception where we don't need to worry about the tags and that is the
            Chinese names often found in the <gi>sponsor</gi> element in the TEI header, these aren't displayed anywhere so they do not need the @xml:lang
            attribute.</p>
          <p>Most of us not knowing Chinese and Japanese will sometimes need to guess according to the context whether the script is "zh" or "ja", however, this
            is not too important because the parser will display Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in the same CJK-pan. So it's not imperative that they are tagged
            100% correctly as long as each instance of CJK unicode is tagged with <hi rend="bold">one of the CJK attributes</hi>: either "zh" "ja" or "ko". </p>
          <p>The following search codes will allow you to easily locate miss-tagged or missing tags:</p>
          <list>
            <item>An XPath Query that will locate any CJK unicode character that does not have an ancestor element with @xml:lang="zh" or "ja":
                <code>//text()[matches(.,
                '&amp;#x4E00;-&amp;#x9FFF;&amp;#x3040;-&amp;#x309F;&amp;#x30A0;-&amp;#x30FF;&amp;#xAC00;-&amp;#xD7AF;')][not(ancestor::*[@xml:lang=('zh') or
                @xml:lang =('ja') or @xml:lang=('ko')])]</code>
            </item>
            <item>An XPath will locate any Roman letter "a-z" or letter "A-Z" that is mislabelled "zh" or "ja": <code>//text()[matches(.,
                '[a-zA-z]')][ancestor::*[@xml:lang = ('zh') or @xml:lang = ('ja')]]</code>
            </item>
            <item>Using the regular CTRL-F search in Oxygen you can also locate Chinese script with the regex pattern: <code>\p{script=Han}+</code>
                        </item>
            <item>And any Japanese script with: <code>[\p{script=Hiragana}\p{script=Katakana}]+</code>
                        </item>
            <item>Korean: <code>\p{script=Hangul}+</code>

          </p>
          <p>Keep an eye out for Chinese in the acknowledgements section and the bibliography where titles and names tend to be missed. Note that when a title
            is given in both Chinese script and pinyin, then two <gi>title</gi> tags are needed to separate the language codes: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                            <title xml:lang="Ja-Ltn">Shirukurōdo to kindai nihon no kaikō: sai’iki kodai shiryō to nihon kindai

                        </egXML> It's not indispensable to check for these every time since we will occasionally
            run these searches on the full TEI translation folder, but it might be a good idea to run the scripts on text that especially heavy in Chinese
            references in the notes and bibliography. </p>

          <p>In this first case, the re-cache can simply be done by going to Project Management for the particular text, select "Edit Headers", up the version
            number and give a note (e.g., "added an endnote") and hit update. It will give you a message "glossary locations may need re-caching" If you made
            any textual changes you'll need to open the glossary editor and check if any re-caching is needed there, but if you are certain that no textual
            changes have been made, then this will not be necessary.</p>
          <p>Now you can select "Generate new associated files." When you see that the version number of the "CACHE" matches that of the TEI, then you know that
            the new notes have been cached. The same applies to milestones, and folio references. </p>

          <p>The workflow for commentaries is to be further developed as we translate more of them and assess the needs of these publications, 
            but generally they will be entered by copy editors into the "<ref target="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10AIqlF1r6ase2yVtGfLHdxERwwK2rn1_/view?usp=drive_link">84000 
              Template for Commentaries</ref>," which only differs from the regular template with the inclusion of a few tags for quotes of the root text. 
            Then these quotes will then be manually matched by markup to the milestones of the root text.</p>
          <div>
            <head>84000 Template for Commentaries (MS Word)</head>
            <p>The template adds six styles that distinguish "Root text" quotes from "Subsidiary" quotes, and further distinguishes those two as either a "Block-Quote"
            "Inline-Quote" or "Block-Verse" (i.e. a quote of verse). These all export with a @type attribute that describes them as either "root" or "subsidiary". This
            @type distinction is arbitrary and not validated by the schema. If the distinction is not needed it can be removed (in the future if this distinction
            proves to be unproductive we'll remove it from the script). The quotes will all be converted with the appropriate <gi>q</gi> tags; otherwise, there is no
            difference from the regular template.</p>

              commentary layout checks</ref>, which has examples of block quotes which link to the primary layout checks (see examples from the documentation there).  
              To see examples of published commentary linked to its root, see <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh3808.html#UT23703-093-001-1535">Toh 
                3808</ref>, which links to Toh 8, Toh 9, and Toh 10. </p>
            <p>For detailed documentation read the commentary layout checks. But as a brief summary:</p>
            <list>
              <item>The commentary text needs to have a <gi>link</gi> element in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> declaring it is a commentary, and of which text. E.g.: <code>&lt;link type="isCommentaryOf" target="toh9"/&gt;</code>
                            </item>
              <item>The root text does not need such a declaration, but it does need a short code in it's &lt;titleStmt&gt;, which will appear as a link at the end of each block 
                quote (see <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh00c.html#UT23703-000-000-68">Toh00c 1.2</ref>)</item>
              <item>A commentary quote is linked to it's root text by adding the following tag inside the <gi>q</gi> tag: &lt;ptr type="quote-ref" rend="substring" target="#[MILESTONE 
                IN ROOT TEXT]"&gt;. This <gi>ptr</gi> tag should be inside any <gi>p</gi> child element. For example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <q>

                </q>
              </egXML>
                In this example at <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh3808.html#UT23703-093-001-16275">Toh 3808 1.3</ref>, it links to both Toh 9 and Toh 10,
                and the matching text is highlighted in the pop-up.
              </item>
              <item>However, if the root text differs from the commentary. A <gi>orig</gi> tag is needed to match what is found in the root text. The &lt;ptr&gt; tag must
                then go inside the &lt;orig&gt; tag. You may need to add tags from the root text's TEI as well in order to get the highlight to match. For example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <p tid="320">He dwelt at Rājagṛha </p>

                the English translation of Toh 10 matches "on Gṛdhrakūṭa Hill" but Toh 9 does not, so the &lt;orig&gt; was added for Toh 9.

              <item>There may be a lot of troubleshooting issues to get the highlighting to match. An ellipsis character … can be used to 
                jump the highlight across sections of text, but it should only be used if it is needed or for a very large quote. </item>
              <item>
                                <p>Highlighting some segments may be tricky. The highlighter often has an issue if a segment at the same milestone is quoted twice but has different start and end points. 
                For instance, if one quote is linked to:</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <q>
                    <p tid="10223">
                                            <ptr type="quote-ref"/>“Furthermore, Lord,
                      bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom should not stand in form,”</p>
                  </q>
                </egXML>
                <p>and another qoute late in the commentary is also linked to the same passage but quotes:</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <q>
                    <p tid="10223">
                                            <ptr type="quote-ref"/>
                      should not stand in form,”</p>
                  </q>
                </egXML>
                <p>The reader won't highlight the first quote properly until the overlap of the two strings is split by an ellipsis "…" break.
                Therefore the first quote should be changed to:</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <q>
                    <p tid="10223">
                                            <ptr type="quote-ref"/>“Furthermore, Lord,
                      bodhisattva great beings practicing the perfection of wisdom…should not stand in form,”</p>
                  </q>
                </egXML>
                <p>then it should highlight correctly.</p>

          <head>Partial Translations in Sections for Large Texts</head>
          <p>The precedent was set with the publication the 100,000 Line Perfection of Wisdom (Toh 8) to publish large texts in partial blocks:</p>
          <list>
            <item>
                            <p>The sectioned blocks should be declared in the //sourceDesc/bibl/<gi>citedRange</gi> element. For instance in Toh 8:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <sourceDesc>
                 <!--...-->
              <bibl type="translation-blocks">
                <citedRange unit="page" from="1" to="1941" status="2.a" xml:id="UT22084-014-001-BLOCK1"/>
                <!--Chapters 1-8-->
                <citedRange unit="page" from="1942" to="2937" status="3" xml:id="UT22084-014-001-BLOCK2"/>
                <!--Chapters 9-13-->
                <citedRange unit="page" from="2938" to="9420" status="3" xml:id="UT22084-014-001-BLOCK3"/>
                <!--Chapters 14-72-->
              </bibl>
              </sourceDesc>
            </egXML>
              <p>Each section can have a separate publication status. This status functions the same way as the status set from Projecct Management and
                appearing in the TEI in the <gi>availability</gi> element. Then only the status="2.a+" sections will be displayed in the reader; however,
              the grayed out chapter title will still be visible from the Table of Contents.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>Then the xml:id of each block should be declared with a @decls attribute in the <gi>div</gi> elements covering those chapters to be included in that block. Example from Toh 8:</p>
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <head xml:id="GUIDELINES_GLOSSARY-1">Guidelines for Glossary</head>

          <head>Some Notes About How the Glossary Works</head>
          <p>Note, also see the <tei:ref target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMr8x-kACoMB_O6ySU0IagoyFm6gTEGIJqgYi2Dx0rI/edit#bookmark=id.6skneq5uuzjw">Translator Guidelines V.G. Glossary</tei:ref>. There is a definitive explanation for translators on how to create their glossaries and these
            principles should be carried forward in to markup.</p>
          <label rend="bold">How Reader Handles Plurals:</label>
          <p>A term will be matched if it is followed by s, es, 's, or s' and then a non-word character, e.g. Maitreya, Maitreya's, Maitreyas. (Unfortunately,
            the general marker for non-word characters is not Sanskrit-aware. It handles Sanskrit diacritic characters as non-word characters. While we have
            handled most of the related issues in this case it can result in a few mistakes, e.g. Maitreyasāyana).</p>
          <label rend="bold">Capitalization</label>
          <p>The glossary is not case-sensitive and will link to names and terms regardless of capitalization. However, note that as a standard within the TEI
            proper names should be capitalized in the English and Sanskrit field but NOT in the Tibetan Wylie field. Although the parser will display all the
            English and Sanskrit entries in the Reading Room itself as capitalized regardless of the text found in the TEI.</p>
          <label rend="bold">Use of the <gi>term</gi> Tag to Mark the Same Word Used in Different Ways:</label>
          <p>Sometimes we will only want certain instances of a string of text to be marked as a glossary term. For example, perhaps we want the term
            "appropriate" to be linked to this term when it is used as verb but not when it used as an adjective. The translator guidelines [G4] instructs
            translators to flag instances of glossary terms that are only relevant to specific passages with the “†” symbol. They are also instructed to specify
            glossary entries as verbs (vb), nouns (n), or adjectives (adj) in cases where the glossary entry is only intended to link to one form of the word
            and not others, for example "play" or "appropriate" (These should not be left in the text but replaced with the markup described in the following
            section). However, many of these may be missed and so all the linked terms should be checked in markup. Note, that we are no longer using
            zero-width-non-joiners to resolve this issue. Instead, we now use the "mode" attribute within the <gi>gloss</gi> element. </p>
          <p>In the glossary, <gi>gloss</gi> nodes can be given the attributes mode="match|marked." Match mode will highlight any matches in the text except
            where they have been marked up with <tag>term rend="ignore"</tag>, e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">parse this <term rend="ignore">but not this</term>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>*Note that a term in the definition field of a glossary entry linking to itself is ignored automatically.</p>
          <p> Marked mode will only match terms that have been marked up with <gi>term</gi> e.g. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Ignore this
                <term>but match this</term>.</egXML>
          </p>
          <!--Currently we are not using priorities-->
          <!--<label>Use of priorities</label>
          <p>Some glossary terms overlap. If a word is found in more than one glossary item then the database will set a priority attribute on the related <gloss> items. Precedence is given to glossary items with a higher priority. By default the priority is derived from the number of words in the phrase. This can be manually overridden by setting the attribute as you wish and saving it. In the following example instances of the term "inconceivable liberation" will be given precedence over "inconceivable" when the text is glossarised.
            <gloss priority="1">
              <term>inconceivable</term>
            </gloss>
            <gloss priority="2">
              <term>inconceivable liberation</term>
            </gloss>
          </p>-->
          <label rend="bold">How Tibetan Is Created from Wylie:</label>
          <p>Where a glossary item has a Wylie term but no Tibetan the database will auto-generate the Tibetan. To re-create a Tibetan term simply remove the
            node, save, and refresh. The Wylie string will also have a trailing space enforced. These will produce the respective syllable separators in the
            Tibetan. Double underscores in Wylie will be replaced with a single space when output to the reader. </p>
          <p>If later you make a correction to a Tibetan entry, be sure to delete the term with Tibetan Unicode (the one with xml:lang="bo") this will trigger
            the database to auto-generate a new one from the corrected Wylie entry, but if you leave it as is the error will remain in the Tibetan Unicode.</p>
          <label rend="bold">Links to Paragraphs with Instances:</label>
          <p>The reader lists links to each paragraph that includes instances of a glossary term.</p>
          <label rend="bold">For Multiple Tibetan and Sanskrit Forms of Spelling for a Single Term:</label>
          <p>In some cases a single <gi>gloss</gi> entry may have multiple forms for spelling the Tibetan, the Sanskrit, or both. In this case each spelling of
            the term can be listed separately in its own <gi>term</gi> element. However, Tibetan should be listed first, followed by the Sanskrit, as in the
            following example for the term "karnikara" (note that a Tibetan "bo" term is auto-generated after each instance of Tibetan Wylie "Bo-Ltn"):</p>

          <p>Alternatives may be added for any related terms that should be linked to the entry such as: <list>
              <item>When a plural "-s" appears in the middle of the string in certain cases and is not linking (as in the XML example above), or not linking
                because the plural has an irregular spelling, e.g. "phenomena" and "phenomenon"; "birth-story" and "birth-stories"; etc...</item>
              <item>Alternate nominal or verbal uses of the same term: appropriate, appropriated, appropriation.</item>
              <item>Extended names such as "Mañjuśrī" and "Mañjuśrī the crown prince". In this last case only if the simple name is clearly represented in the
                extended one, otherwise a second <gi>gloss</gi> should be added referring to the primary one, e.g.: The Great Compassionate One -- See
                Avalokiteśvara.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>However, alternatives should not be used for two semantically different English words, even if they are translated from the same Tibetan term and
            have similar meaning. For example if "offering" and "worship" are both used for "mchod pa / pūjā". They should be given two different glossary
            entries.</p>
          <p>The 84000 translator's guidelines (G4) states this clearly:</p>
          <p>If the same Tibetan or Sanskrit word was translated in more than one way, include an entry for each, and place in the definition a reference to the
            other rendering, e.g. for the entry “Offering” (mchod pa / pūjā): “Also translated here as ‘worship,’ ” (and vice versa for the entry
            “Worship”).</p>
          <p>There are two reasons for this. (1) We don't want readers unfamiliar with Tibetan and Sanskrit clicking on a term like "worship" and having it link
            to "offering," and (2) Some readers may be reading the text in a PDF format or even someday in print and will need to look up terms alphabetically
            as the hyperlinks won't be available.</p>
          <p>Some of these alternatives may have been entered improperly and will need to be separated into separate entries. This should be handled by copy
            editors, but in some cases it may be missed and markup editors will be more capable of spotting inconsistencies or issues in the glossary since they
            will be able to actually click on the links and check them in the Reading Room. </p>
          <p>There has been some further discussion regarding whether alternatives should be used when the English words for a glossary entry are used in a
            different word order. So in the example above for "door of the dharma" one might ask, should this itself be used as an alternative linking to the
            entry for "dharma-door" or should it be in a separate entry? In this case it isn't such an issue that the reader would click on "door of the Dharma"
            and see the entry for "Dharma-door" but it is an issue for anyone reading the PDF. However it is quite sensible that the reader would simply search
            for the term under "dharma" if they did not find it in "door". If there are a just a few instances of these it makes sense to create separate
            entries, but if the amount of entries with alternate word order is becoming extensive then this could be an issue because it will muddy up the
            glossary, be difficult for reader to find all the instances of a term from the "passages contain this term" field, and also it could muddy up the
            cumulative glossary. When there are a lot of such alternatives it may be better to set such phrases as "door of the dharma" as an alternative
            provided that it would be sensible from the perspective of the reader and there aren't semantically distinct words (e.g., you wouldn't want to add
            "gateway of the dharma" as an alternative). If there are a lot of such instances, you should also check with the editors about changing the
            translation to be more consistent (make notes about such instances in the Reading Room Worksheet). This should be taken on a case by case basis and
            always thought of from the readers perspective.</p>
          <label rend="bold">Further Explanation on the Mode Attribute:</label>
          <p>The mode attribute is not required, but when present it can either be "match" or "marked." "Match" is the default (where this attribute is not
            specified). "Match" will behave in the normal way: the text is scanned for glossary matches and highlighted accordingly.</p>
          <p>"Marked," on the other hand, will only consider text strings that have been marked up with <gi>term</gi>. An example for "appropriate" is below: </p>

          <list>
            <item>Sometimes a term will appear in its own definition. By default the parser will block these from linking to themselves.</item>
            <item>If there are references in the definition to a term, such as "see also...", they can be placed into a second <tag>term type="definition"</tag>
              line, to create some visual lightness in the final webdisplay.</item>
            <item>If a word is not linking in the webdisplay, here are some common causes for instances not being detected by the parser: <list>
                <item>Plurals in the middle of strings of words (where the "s" doesn't come at the end).</item>
                <item>An extra space at the end of the term in the glossary.</item>
                <item>Sanskrit soft-hypens in the term not matching with the glossary entry.</item>
              </list>
            </item>
            <item>Occasionally you will see a word in the text that is similar to a glossary term but isn't linked because it takes as different form. For
              instance, "appropriate" is in the glossary, but you see "appropriation" in the text. If you see instances like this you can add an <tag>term
                type="translationAlternative"</tag> to that <gi>gloss</gi> item, but be sure that you are not then linking to other unwanted instances as well.</item>

          <p>Note that the glossary needs to be specifically re-cached from the Glossary Editor, while when endnotes, milestones, or folio references should be
            re-cached from project management (see Appendix B TOPICS: <ptr target="#RECACHE_PUBLICATIONS-1"/>).</p>
          <p>To re-cached from the Glossary Editor: Click on "Batch update options" and selecting "Re-cache location of all entries". This will re-cache the
            glossary according to the current matching and modes.</p>
          <p>Some large texts, particularly ones with extensive glossaries may take a long time to re-cache (the longest example of this is Toh 94 which
            currently takes about 6 hours), however most of texts should only take a few seconds. Note that the time it took previously to re-cache will be
            displayed by the editor.</p>
          <p>This re-cache function runs in the background, so you can work on other things or open other texts in the editor while it is running. It will
            continue to display the message "job running, please wait" until the re-cache is complete. (to check if it is done, run a new search, refreshing the
            page doesn't always work in this case).</p>
          <p>After re-caching the glossary editor will tell you: <list>
              <item>How many entries are cached behind the current version. It will display this in the header e.g. "63 Behind". This is the number of entries
                that were cached in the previous cache file. This can be searched as "Cached behind". </item>
              <item>How many entries have newly cached locations. This will display in the header e.g. "3 new". This is the number of entries with newly cached
                locations. This should be double checked to make sure they were intended to be cached. If they look fine, then no further actions are needed,
                however if there are some that shouldn't be cached, please correct them in the TEI and re-cache again.</item>
              <item>Any missing entries will be flagged as "missing". These locations have been lost for some reason and should be investigated/corrected in the
                TEI.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>If it is a large text and it will take an long time to re-cache, it is suitable to just cache glossary entries individually if you're certain that
            only a few glossary entries have changed. For example if you needed to add one glossary entry, "nāga" to Toh 94, instead of doing a full recache,
            you could instead add the entry, then search in the glossary editor for the entry "nāga" and click "cache locations". Then you would update the file
            version say from v1.0.1 to v1.0.2, but leave the cache as v1.0.1, then when you push the TEI for v1.0.2 it will properly link to the locations of
            the instance "nāga" because those locations have been added to v1.0.1 when you clicked "cache locations" of "nāga". Thus you have avoided the 6
            hours wait and CPU usage to cache just one entry.</p>

              <p>The issue is when the same term follows itself, with only whitespace between them. 
                Then the second term is not being picked up. It has to do with the way regular expressions 
                are implemented in xslt in exist (it doesn't recognise the start of the in memory remainder 
                string as a string start). We have a fix for this in xquery but the same fix doesn't work in 
                xslt, and the possible alternatives don't seem to solve the problem either.
                As this is such a rare case, we'll use a workaround for now:
                One option is to simply precede following isntances of a repeating string with zero length joiner. 
                For example, see <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh555.html?view-mode=editor#UT22084-089-012-1930">Toh 555 14.13</ref>:</p>

          <head rend="bold" xml:id="GLOSSARY_FROM_SPREADSHEET-1">Transform the Glossary from the Spreadsheet</head>
          <p>Typically, the glossaries are converted from tables in the 84000 .docx template, but if the glossary was instead entered into an .xslx spreadsheet, please follow 
          the instructions as follows:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Before transforming the glossary with the script, make sure that the tables are formatted properly. In Excel, there should be three or four
              sheets labeled "Terms", "People", "Places", and on occasion there will be a fourth sheet that should be labeled "Texts". If the labels of the
              sheets aren't spelled exactly like this, then the script won't apply the correct <att>type</att> to the <gi>gloss</gi> elements. Each
              sheet/table needs to have seven columns that are to be exactly arranged as follows: (A) Tibetan Wylie, (B) Sanskrit, (C) Skt Source, (D) Chinese (optional), (E) Translation, (F)
              Definition, and (G) Alternatives. (See also <tei:ref target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RWRbrjJH39xBtiquQnYzdoUGHokdhhg/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112365917895543430041&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">the template in the shared google drive</tei:ref>). Older templates will only have five columns and so the missing ones can be filled by right clicking and inserting blank ones from MS Word.</item>
            <!--<item>Note that occasionally you may get a glossary with an additional column of Chinese terms. If this is the case, add Chinese as a sixth column
                (F). If you need to edit the Chinese from the table side by side with the Tibetan and Sanskrit, that is fine just be sure to move the Chinese
                column into the sixth place before you convert the file or else the cells will be applied incorrectly by the script.</item>-->

              <label rend="bold">Using a Macro to Correct Initial Apostrophes:</label>
            </item>
            <item> When you receive a glossary file in an Excel spreadsheet format, it’s likely there will be hidden apostrophes in the wylie column. This
              happens when a straight apostrophe is typed at the beginning of the word, as in the case of an a-chung prefix, "འ". Excel uses straight
              apostrophes to override the cell's format when typing numbers so that it considers it as text. In the process it hides this initial apostrophe,
              although there actually is an apostrophe in the cell, i.e., it disappears unless one actually clicks on the cell and looks in the text box at
              the top of the screen. In some cases the translator may have entered two apostrophes by mistake, or put one where there shouldn't be one. In all
              cases, these will need to be corrected, as the translator should not use straight apostrophes in the wylie text at all, but only use left
              curving apostrophes (’) (otherwise the script will not display proper Tibetan Unicode below them). Interestingly, the invisible apostrophes are
              not carried over if you copy a table and paste it into the Glossary Template, However, these initial apostrophes still need to be checked
              because the author may have thought they had correctly placed one into the beginning of a cell, but then the apostrophe will have disappeared
              and won't get carried over to the Template. To make this check and fix any errors, you should run the following macro in Excel. This macro will
              convert each initial straight apostrophe. However, most often these are a spelling error in the wylie transliteration and will need to be
              corrected (each instance must be verified in a Tibetan dictionary). To make these instances easy to find, the macro also adds “111” so that it’s
              easy to make a search for these cells. The “111” is just a marker and will obviously need to be removed too.</item>
            <item>In case you don't know how to run a macro in Excel, there are many tutorials available on Youtube for both PC and Mac. There might be some
              differences depending on the version of your Excel software, but they should be pretty straightforward. You may be prevented from running a
              macro if the file is "shared"; you may have to go to the "Review" tab, click on "Share Workbook," and uncheck the box to share the file with
              other users (this might be slightly different on Mac). Then you should be able to run the macro without any problem. Here is the macro. Paste
              the following code into a module window and hit "run": <p> Sub AposChange()<lb/> Dim Rng As Range, Cell As Range<lb/> ThisWorkBook.Activate<lb/>
                Set Rng = Cells.SpecialCells(xlConstants)<lb/> Cells(Rows.Count, Columns.Count).Copy<lb/> For Each Cell In Rng<lb/> If Cell.PrefixCharacter =
                "'" Then<lb/> Cell.Value = "111 ’" + Cell.Value<lb/> Cell.PasteSpecial Operation:=xlPasteSpecialOperationAdd<lb/> End If<lb/> Next Cell<lb/>
                Application.CutCopyMode = False<lb/> End Sub</p>
            </item>
            <item> Here is an example. When you look at the spreadsheet you will see: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">’khor ba ’jig</egXML>
              But in the file there is actually a hidden apostrophe: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> '’khor ba ’jig</egXML>So after running
              the macro script it will become: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">111 ’’khor ba ’jig</egXML> In this example there should be no
              hesitation about what to remove, but in other cases you may need to check in the dictionary.</item>
            <item>Note this macro only runs on one sheet at a time, and it only works on the first sheet in a .xlsx document, so you will need to copy the
              second and third sheet into new spreadsheet files, open each sheet separately in Excel, and then run the macro separately for each. (Sorry this
              is such a long process, this is probably a good reason for us to do all the glossaries from an MS Word template in the future.)</item>

        <head xml:id="GUIDELINES_MILESTONES-1">Guidelines for Entering Milestones into the TEI Document</head>
        <p>Milestones are applied to the document with the “<tag>milestone unit="chunk"/</tag>” tag. Because the 84000 reading room does not have page numbers,
          milestones are particularly important for referencing sections or paragraphs in the text.</p>
        <p>Generally milestones should be placed at the beginning of every paragraph and at the beginning of every stanza of verse. However, in cases where
        paragraphs are exceptionally short--ones that only extend one or two lines across the reader on a typical computer screen--then one milestone may be 
        used for two short paragraphs. Note that by default, the TEI script will generate a milestone for every paragraph or stanza of verse and superflous milestones
        should be removed by the markup editor.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that earlier publications (up until mid-2023) had guidelines which placed milestones more sparsely apart. However, it was determined
        that it is better to have more milestones than less because it gives the ability to cite passages more precisely. Therefore, we have updated the guidelines
        to only require trimming milestones in the case of exceptionally short paragraphs as defined above.</p>
        <!--<p>Milestones should be applied to the text at places where there is a logical/thematic division in the text. Sometimes, milestones can be placed at the
          beginning of each paragraph of prose. In cases where paragraphs are very short (only one or two sentences) milestones can be placed one for every two
          or more paragraphs depending on the context, or a particularly short paragraph can share the milestone with that of a larger previous or later
          paragraph that shares the same “theme.”</p>
        <p>To a large degree the editor should use their own judgment: If the milestones are too frequent, then it will become distracting to the reader on the
          page. If they are too far apart, it will be difficult to cite particular passages of the text. It is helpful to check the display in the reading room
          after applying milestones to make sure they appear in a convenient way and to visually check there is general consistency throughout the text.</p>
        <p>Often there will be very short paragraphs used during sections of dialogue. A logical way to organize these sections is to allow one question and
          answer to be given a single milestone. For example, the following passage could be given one milestone: </p>-->
        <p>Here is an example of using a single milestone for two very short paragraphs of dialogue. Note, that if this is done, it is best to keep a question
        and it's answer within the same milestone if possible:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <milestone unit="chunk"/>
          <p tid="5578">“Blessed Lord, is enlightenment then attained by a path that arises?”</p>
          <p tid="5579">“No!” replied the Blessed One.</p>
        </egXML>

            Room).</tei:ref>
                </p>
        <!--<p>If either the question or the answer are very short paragraphs (one or two sentences), then they could be appended to the milestone along with their
          respective question and answer. However, if both the question and answer are long paragraphs in themselves, they should each be given their own
          milestone. Of course, there will always be unique situations such as questions being answered with another question and so forth. The editor should in
          general use their own discretion to decide what frequency of milestones would be the most useful and least distracting to the reader. They should to
          try to be consistent with their usage. </p>
        <p>When entering milestones for lines of verse, the editor should apply milestones in a consistent manner, which will typically be one milestone marker
          between every line group element <gi>lg</gi>. Usually this will be a verse of four lines in English. </p>-->

        <!--<p>Here the editor might place a milestone for each item in the list depending on the length of each paragraph. It might also be appropriate to place
          the milestones according to logical groupings in the list, for example place one milestone for the four immeasurables, one milestone for the six
          paramitas, etc. Finally, if the list becomes overburdened by milestones, the editor can add the milestones for every two or four items in the list. In
          this case it might be worthwhile to check how many items there are in the list then seek a reasonable way to divide it up evenly. </p>
        <p>If the editor is not sure about the frequency for applying milestones, he or she can refer to some of the other texts in the reader and see how
          frequently the milestones are used in other texts. For now, <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh131.html">Toh 131 is a good
            example.</ref></p>
        <p>While editing in oXygen, it can be easier to edit milestones while in "author mode" (go to "Author" in the menu bar and click on "Switch to Author
          Mode." This will show the layout of the text more clearly and you can remove the milestones by double clicking on them and hitting delete.) This is a
          useful way to quickly edit milestones, but should not be a substitute for checking visually in the Reading Room.</p>-->
        <p>There are a few places where we <hi rend="italic">always</hi> want to have a milestone: (1) trailers (both at the end of chapters and any concluding

        <head xml:id="SANSKRIT-SOFT-HYPHENS-1">Guidelines for Entering Soft Hyphens to Sanskrit</head>
        <p>Note that only editors with a basic understanding of the spelling and sandhi rules of Sanskrit should proceed with this step. You don't need to be an
          expert in Sanskrit, as most words can be looked up in online references, however, for this step editors will need to have a clear grasp on how the
          sandhi rules in Sanskrit work. If not please request that another editor with this skill to complete this task.</p>
        <list>
          <item>Look for long Sanskrit chains, and add optional soft-hyphens at points where there are chains that are 15+ characters long. Optional
            soft-hyphens are created with the character code: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">&amp;#173;</egXML> Or keep a copy of the character in 
            a text file for copy/pasting, sorry I can't paste it here because it will disappear in the HTML, but note that after you save the XML
            and refresh these will look like regular hyphens, but if you move the blinking cursor to the space just before the hyphen you will notice there is a different
            character code, "U+00AD" displayed at the bottom of the oXygen screen. You can then copy and paste the character into a text file for later use.</item>
          <item>The long Sanskrit chains can be found easily by going to Window &gt; Show View &gt; XPath/XQuery Builder, then in the XPath/XQuery Builder
            window type the following code and press the red play button:<code>//*[string-length(string()) &gt; 14 and @xml:lang ='Sa-Ltn']</code> You can save
            this query for later by clicking on the star and choosing "add to favourites."</item>
          <item xml:id="SANSKRIT-SOFT-HYPHENS-2">Note that texts that have Sanskrit appendixes will not be checked by the code above because these sections
            aren't marked with an @xml:lang attribute. Generally, the Sanskrit appendixes such as the one in <tei:ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh437.html#appendix">Toh 437</tei:ref> does not need soft hyphens because it is not anticipated
            that they will be read on small devices. However, occasionally there may be extremely long strings in the appendices that will fill the screen even
            on a regular web browser. For the appendices our current limit is any strings longer than 40 continuous characters without as space. To search the
            appendices, press CTRL/SHIFT/H to "search in files" then check the "regular expression" box, in the scope select "All open files", and in "Restrict
            to XPath:" enter the code: <code>//text()</code>. Finally, in the search field enter the following regex code:
              <code>(^|\s|-­)[^\s-­]{40,}($|\s|-­)</code>. This should give you a list of all the 40+ strings while ignoring tags, spaces, or hyphens.</item>
          <item>Be careful when adding the soft hyphens as they should only be placed at certain points in the words where they do not interfere with the
            Sanskrit rules of sandhi. When adding the soft hyphens please follow the following guidelines:</item>
          <item>
            <label>Guidelines for Adding Soft-Hyphens to Sanskrit:</label>
            <list>
              <item>
                <p>1. As we are not using full justification anyway, (a) most Sanskrit words don’t need hyphenation unless they are longer than 5 or 6
                  syllables, but (b) may be necessary for shorter words especially in text titles on the title page. I therefore tend to place soft hyphens in
                  all of the text titles, in verse passages, in the bibliography entries, and in notes and glossary entries (which require shorter lines in
                  general).</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <p>2. Place a soft hyphen (a) only between the words of a compound; (b) even then only when there are no changes brought about by sandhi
                  (because putting a hyphen would logically mean undoing the sandhi, and the hyphens we’re talking about may or may not appear); and (c)
                  avoiding confusing remnants.</p>
                <p>A couple of examples:</p>
                <p>Ratnagotravibhāgottaratantraśāstra would be Ratna-gotra-vibhāgottara-tantra-śāstra. If we divided the 5-syllable sequence in the middle, that
                  would have to undo the sandhi and become -vibhāga-uttara-, which only works in the presence of a hard hyphen. Theoretically we could put a
                  hyphen at vi-bhāga, but that would risk leaving us with -gotravi-, which would be potentially confusing to read.</p>
                <p>The maximum we could hyphenate antānantaḍṛṣṭivāsanābhisaṃdhisamuccedaka would be antānanta-ḍṛṣṭi-vāsanābhi-saṃdhi-sam-ucchedaka, because
                  antānanta and vāsanābhi-saṃdhi would become anta-ananta and vāsana-abhi-saṃdhi. In a case like that, I would also prefer to avoid ending up
                  with antānantaḍṛṣṭivāsanābhi-saṃdhisamuccedaka, because the abhi- really belongs with the saṃdhi; it’s a possible break but is confusing to
                  read.</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                                <p>One resource that is helpful for determining the breaks in Sanskrit chains in the online <tei:ref target="https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/simple-search/v1.0/list-0.2s.html">Cologne Sanskrit Dictionary</tei:ref>. This one is
                really helpful because it has a drop down menu of similarly spelled words when you hit the enter key. Then when you find a big word in the dictionary in the definition
                entry you will see * whenever there is sandhi, though this isn't 100% reliable. Sometimes it is missing for some reason, so be careful if the
                spelling looks weird.</p>
                            </item>
              <item xml:id="MAIN-TERM-SOFT-HYPHENS-1">
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="bold">***Important Note***</hi> 
                <hi rend="bold">Soft-hyphens are also needed for the "mainTranslation" field and matching strings the consist of long Sanskrit compounds</hi>. There are some "Persons" and "Places" that occasionally use the untranslated Sanskrit for the main translation, these will not be flagged by
                the XPath code because, as proper nouns, they aren't typically italicized and therefore aren't tagged with @xml:lang="Sa-Ltn". However, it is easy to identify these because they will match 
                the Sanskrit field in the glossary entry which will be flagged by the XPath. 
                For this reason I typically check the Sanskrit by going backwards through the TEI, and when the Sanskrit field in the glossary entries is flagged 
                I look at the “mainTranslation” field to see if it replicates the Sanskrit. If so, then soft hyphens should be applied in the same manner to the 
                "mainTranslation" field, and then a search and replace is needed throughout the text because these soft hyphens affect how strings are linked to the glossary. 
                However, be mindful of the capitalization, as the term may be contained as a sub-segment in a longer string, so it's better to do a step-through
                search and replace rather than replacing all at once. Changing these Sanskrit strings in the glossary are important because otherwise the "our translation"
                field will be cut off for long strings in the app or if read on the screen of a phone.</p>
                            </item>
              <item>
                                <p>In certain cases there may be long 15+ Sanskrit chains that cannot be broken due to the sandhi, or long Sanskrit compounds whose pieces
                cannot be easily determined with online resources. If this is the case make a list of problematic instances to note for the leading editors, and
                also check these instances to see if the pose any major difficultly for the web display. These instances are rare, but they do come up now and
                then.</p>
                            </item>
              <item>
                                <p>It is acceptable to add an optional hyphen at the end of "mahā-" as in "mahā-yāna" even though technically the long ā would be lost, as this
                is a well known word and unlikely to be misread.</p>

          <head xml:id="CHECK_FOR_HIDDEN_TEXT-1">Text Mysteriously Appearing in TEI from Hidden Text in the MS Word Document</head>
          <p>Occasionally you may see a string of gibberish mysteriously appears in the middle of the TEI file. This issue occurs when a string is applied as
            "hidden" through the Font menu in MS Word (Right-Click -&gt; Font -&gt; then check "Hidden"). The problem is that our TEI conversion scripts makes
            the string of text reappear when it is converted from DOCX to TEI. This reappearance is implemented in the initial OxGarage script, so I am unable
            to remedy it with our own XSLT script.</p>
          <p>A segment of “Hidden”text could be inadvertently contained inside a DOCX submitted for publication, it's very rare since it seems like one would
            need to do it intentionally, but it could possibly occur when a .DOCX file is edited from an alternate word processor in the translation process
            (this is just my theory). Since it is hidden in the document it goes unnoticed in our own copyediting phase, but reappears in the TEI.</p>
          <p>However, there is an easy way to check if a text has “Hidden” text: <list>
              <item>(1) On Windows, right click the DOCX file -&gt; “rename” the file, and change the file type from “.docx” to “.zip”. It will give you a
                warning, but just hit okay.</item>
              <item>(2) Then extract that “.zip” file with an archive extractor like WinZip, 7Zip, or whatever.</item>
              <item>(3) Then use a texteditor like Notepad++ or Oxygen that has a “Searchfolder” application and search the extracted archive for the tag:
                  <code>w:vanish</code> Any instance of the tag will show you "hidden" text which will appear in the TEI after the conversion; you should then
                evaluate whether those specific strings were intended to be in the text but were accidentally removed, or if they are remnant edits that
                shouldn't be there.</item>
            </list> An example can be found as follows: go to Project Management and download the last .docx for Toh 257
            "toh-257-quintessence-of-the-sun-for-markup-apr-18-2022.docx", performing the search method above will reveal a "&lt;w:vanish&gt;But
            h&lt;w:vanish/&gt;" tag). In this instance it was a remnant edit that seemed to be preserved from an earlier time (this led me to believe that some
            of these are saves from alternate word processors).</p>
          <p>This situation is pretty rare, so it's probably not necessary to check every time. But, do check if (A) you notice odd strings showing up in the
            middle of your markup, or (B) this check should be performed for any large complex text, especially if it was passed around a lot between different
            parties.</p>

        <p>Note that updating the schema and ODD is a bit more complicated, so this should be handled by the lead editors or technicians. Otherwise, if you are
          working on a markup and notice that the schema needs to be updated (i.e., there is some markup needed but you are getting a schema error for that
          markup), then make this a point to send to the lead editors in your final list of questions and issues for finalizing the text. Please disregard the
          following instructions unless you are a lead editor or technician.</p>
        <list>
          <item>This appendix gives a brief explanation and checklist for how to update the ODD. <tei:ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html">However, you may need to refer to the 22nd chapter of the TEI
              guidelines</tei:ref> for a more detailed explanation on how the elements in the ODD work. You may also need to refer to the <tei:ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html">23rd chapter of the TEI guidelines</tei:ref> which contains information on the
            content models, attribute customizations, and TEI conformance.</item>
          <item>Most of the restrictions in the ODD are defined in the element specifications. In order to create documentation, an <gi>elementSpec</gi> has
            been created for all of the elements we use. There are also some schema restrictions defined in class specifications, <gi>classSpec</gi>, and macro
            specifications, <gi>macroSpec</gi>. In our ODD's XML the <gi>classSpec</gi>s are listed first followed by the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s followed by the
              <gi>elementSpec</gi>s all in alphabetical order. If you need to jump to a specific element, they can easily be found by searching for their
              <att>ident</att> attribute. For example, to find the <gi>elementSpec</gi> for the "front", search for <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">c ident="front"</egXML> and this will take you to that section of the ODD.</item>
          <item>Adding new elements will require creating a new <gi>elementSpec</gi> and adding it to the ODD. Adding or modifying attributes can be done in
            that specific element's <gi>attList</gi>. For example here is the <gi>attList</gi> for the <gi>title</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <attList>
                <attDef ident="type" mode="change">
                  <desc>classifies the title according to the TBRC typology.</desc>
                  <desc>classifies the title according to the 84000 typology.</desc>
                  <valList type="closed" mode="replace">
                    <valItem ident="mainTitle"/>
                    <valItem ident="longTitle"/>
                    <valItem ident="otherTitle"/>
                  </valList>
                </attDef>
                <attDef ident="xml:id" mode="delete"/>
                <attDef ident="level" mode="delete"/>
                <attDef ident="xml:lang" mode="change" usage="req"/>
              </attList>
            </egXML> The <gi>attDef</gi> defines a particular attribute for <gi>title</gi>, along with a description <gi>desc</gi>. The <gi>valList</gi> defines
            what values are allowed in the "type" attribute. Since we don't use the default "xml:id" and "level" attributes in our <gi>title</gi>s they have
            been set to "delete" so they won't appear in our documentation. We want the "xml:lang" to be required for all <gi>title</gi>s so the usage has been
            set to "reg". More details should can be found in the TEI guidelines. </item>
          <item> When a language needs to be added to the schema, the language list is actually found in the class specification for "att.global" that defines
            the "xml:lang" attribute. It should be added here so it will apply to all the elements that use "xml:lang". To find this section search for <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> attDef ident="xml:lang" </egXML>

            stated then the default TEI content model will be used when the schema is generated in from Oxgarage. You can look up the default content model in
            the <tei:ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html">appendix of the TEI Guidelines</tei:ref> Because the 84000

            why you will see the prefix "rng:-" before many of the elements there. When the content model needs to be updated, that is the rules which govern
            how the elements are to be nested, look for the <gi>content</gi> element in the ODD for that element's <gi>elementSpec</gi>. If is a global rule for
            that element it will be found there. However, keep in mind if it is a rule specific to the order or structure found in the <gi>front</gi>,
              <gi>body</gi>, or <gi>back</gi>, then the content model will be found in those element's content models. </item>
          <item>To avoid writing repetitive code, there are also some content models declared in the <gi>marcroSpec</gi> these may be referred to in other
            content models, which will look something like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <rng:ref name="paragraph"/>
            </egXML> In this example the rng element points to the content model of our basic paragraph. And if that needs to be updated in can be done so in
            the <gi>macroSpec</gi> for "paragraph". </item>
          <item>Note there are also many descriptions, <gi>desc</gi>, as well as examples <gi>egXML</gi> contained in all the specifications. It is not required
            to update these for the generation of the schema, but when you make in update, it would be good to update these as well so that our documentation
            can be most up to date. Also consider whether an update is something that the markup editors need to be aware of during their work flow. If it is,
            please add some explanation and/or protocol for the markup editors in the "Checklist for 84000 TEI Markup Editors". This appendix is found in the
              <gi>back</gi> of the ODD.</item>
          <item>Occasionally, we may add a new element to our schema that is already included in one of the standard TEI modules. Note, that these standard
            elements are all declared at the beginning of the ODD in the <gi>moduleRef</gi>. This happened to me, I couldn't figure out why the <gi>hi</gi>
            element wasn't validating even though it was declared in an <gi>elementSpec</gi>. The reason was I had assumed it was declared as a part of the
            "core" module, but had forgotten to add it to the list within the <gi>moduleRef</gi>. </item>
          <item>If you can't figure out why an added element or attribute isn't validating properly for a schema update. A good technique is to paste that
            element into a TEI document apply the schema, and read the schema error message at the bottom of the oXygen window. It should tell you what the
            schema is expecting and based on that you can determine where and which content model needs to be updated. Also keep in mind that any element from
            the standard TEI modules will have the default content model if a new one isn't declared, so <tei:ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html">you may need to look up the element in the TEI guidelines</tei:ref> to
            find its default content model as well as its other parameters.</item>
          <item> To summarize here is a brief checklist for any updates for the ODD/schema. <list>
              <item>1) Make any changes to the element that needs update in that elements <gi>elementSpec</gi>
              </item>
              <item>2) Does this change need to be reflected in the content model? If so make the appropriate corrections to the <gi>content</gi> found within
                the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, <gi>back</gi>, or possibly one of the
                <gi>macroSpec</gi>s</item>
              <item>3) Update examples, <gi>egXML</gi> and/or descriptions <gi>desc</gi> if needed.</item>
              <item>4) Update the markup editor's checklist if needed.</item>

            </label>
            <list>
              <item> The Xpath/XQuery builder is a useful tool for searching for unwanted stuff in the glossaries like brackets, slashes and so on. To open, go
                to Window &gt; Show View &gt; XPath/XQuery Builder </item>
              <item>For example to search for a bracket withing the glossary use the following code: <code>//gloss/term[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(text(),
                  "(")]</code> The "(" at the end is what determines the bracket. Enter this into the XPath/XQuery Builder and press the play button to perform
                the search.</item>
              <item> To find an opening square bracket in the glossary use the following code: <code>//gloss/term[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(text(), "(") or
                  contains(text(), "[")]</code>
              </item>
              <item> By using backslashes and element names you can also look for specific terms within particular elements, for example to search for a certain
                "word" within the <gi>note</gi> elements, you could use this code: <code>//note[contains(data(), 'word')]</code> Here 'word' is what you are
                looking for. <code>//</code> means search everywhere, <code>//note</code> means search everywhere for <gi>note</gi>s. </item>

            <list>
              <item> You may notice that when you search for certain phrases in the XML, the phrase may not be found in the "Find/Replace" dialog. This is
                because the search tool is very precise so it will not find phrases with two or more words that are separated by a line break unless you specify
                it to do so. One way around this is to use the "Find in files" (click the second smaller magnifying glass in the ribbon or CTRL/SHIFT/H). Then
                select "All opened files" (It will ask you to save before it searches) and make sure "Ignore white spaces" is checked ("Regular expressions"
                must be unchecked for it to work). It will then ignore the line breaks. </item>
              <item> The method above doesn't work with regular expressions. If you need to search in this way with regular expressions, then try replacing the
                spaces in your code with: <code>\s+</code>, e.g. search "door of dharma" with "door\s+of\s+dharma" </item>
              <item>On occasion you may want to search the XML while ignoring all the tags. To do this, again use "find in files" CTRL/Shift/H and in the field
                that says "Restrict to XPath;" enter the code <code>//text()</code>
                            </item>
              <item>This will ignore the tags in your search results. Note, it will ignore the tags but it can't search over tags if a tag appears in the middle
                of a searched phrase, so for instance it won't fine "vidyā being" in the XML for <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                    <term>vidyā</term> being</egXML>

        <label>
          <hi rend="bold">Version Numbering:</hi>
        </label>
        <p>The three digit version numbering (e.g., "v 1.2.1") we are using here refer respectively to "major", "minor", and "revision" changes to the text
          (This emulates <tei:ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">software versioning standards</tei:ref>).</p>
        <p>Any changes in the third decimal relate to very minor textual updates that don't substantially affect the text (typos, minor markup/formatting
          consistencies, etc.). A change from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 signals to the reader that there is no need to download it. Any change in the second decimal
          relates to a minor, but more significant changes within the text itself as well as to significant markup changes. For example, a missing stanza has
          been added, or a misspelled term has been corrected throughout the text. A change from 1.2.1 to 1.3.0 indicates that readers should download the
          latest version to have an improved version of the text. Any change in the first decimal would be a major change to the text, so 1.3.1 to 2.0.0. would
          be a clear sign that it should be downloaded.</p>
        <p>To summarize:</p>
        <list>
          <item>Changes in the third decimal relate to very minor textual and markup changes, e.g., 1.3.4 to 1.3.5</item>
          <item>Changes in the second decimal relate to minor, but more significant textual and markup changes, e.g., 1.3.4 to 1.4.0</item>
          <item>Changes in first decimal relate to major text changes, e.g., 1.3.4 to 2.0.0</item>
        </list>
        <label>
          <hi rend="bold">Text Numbering Workflow</hi>
        </label>
        <p>Most texts that have not been started in the translation process have no version number. When a text receives its first update it will change to</p>
        <p>0.0.1</p>
        <p>When markup is started, the text gets an initial version number:</p>
        <p>0.1.1</p>
        <p>From that point on, version numbers will increase every time editors feel it’s necessary as they work on the text. As noted before, changes made to
          the second decimal point are reserved for more significant textual and markup edits, and changes made to the third decimal point are reserved for
          minor textual and markup edits. Theoretically, a text could go through many versions before it is ready for publication, eg</p>
        <p>0.0.1 to 0.0.2</p>
        <p>0.0.2 to 0.1.0</p>
        <p>0.1.0 to 0.1.1 etc</p>
        <p>When the text is ready for publication then the version number is set by the markup editor to</p>
        <p>1.0.0</p>
        <label>
          <hi rend="bold">When updating the TEI to a published translation please use the following procedure:</hi>
        </label>
        <list>
          <item> (1) Save your changes from Oxygen. </item>
          <item> (2) If you changed any of the markup, run the automated tests on the individual file by clicking on "run tests" next to the text title from
              <tei:ref target="http://utilities.84000-translate.org/translations.html">the Utilities page</tei:ref> (Note: don't run the automated tests from the
            "tests" tab unless it is necessary to check all the texts, as this will uses up a lot of the server's resources). Correct any issues related to
            failing test results or inform tech (Dom) about any test updates that may be needed. </item>
          <item> (3) Finally, after saving the TEI from Oxygen, the version number needs to be updated separately on <tei:ref target="https://projects.84000-translate.org/index.html">the project management page</tei:ref>. This is important to keep track of any changes we've
            made to the published text: From the project management page, find the text according to its "text status," then click on "edit headers." From here,
            update both the version number (as described in the guidelines above) and if necessary the version's date (entering for the date only a four digit
            year, e.g., "2019"). Note, the "Publication Date" refers to the date of the original publication, so please leave this unchanged. Please also add a
            brief note in the "Add a note about this version" field about what changes were made. Now, click the "Update" button. Updating the version number in
            this way will simultaneously update the <gi>editionStmt</gi>'s version and date within the TEI file, upload the latest version to the Github
            repository, and generate the newest version of the eBook and PDF (this last part of the update only occurs if it is status="1"). </item>
          <item> (4) Note that unless the change is urgent, you do not need to push the file to distribution. This will be handled in a weekly check by the
            revision lead (Martina). </item>
        </list>
        <lb/>
        <p>Note that there is a delay when pushing to distribution. It sometimes takes 6-8 hours to see changes updated. If you want to assure that the changes
          will be made change the URL on distribution from "...read" to "...direct-read" e.g.: change "https://read.84000.co/translation/toh83.html" to
          "https://direct-read.84000.co/translation/toh83.html". This will show you the pending updates.</p>
        <lb/>
        <label>
          <hi rend="bold">Global Changes:</hi>
        </label>
        <p>Occasionally, global changes will need to be made for all the texts, usually performed with a script or a search-and-replace in the translations
          folder (By the way if you make global search-and-replaces to a folder be sure that Oxygen's "Make back of files with extension" box is unchecked, as
          this will cause problems in the database). Since it would be time consuming to update each text manually, please follow this protocol for updating the
          texts manually: <list>
            <item>1.) Make the global change (using script or find and replace). Make sure that the operation has worked correctly.</item>
            <item>2.) Ask tech (Dominic) to run a script to update version numbers and add a descriptive note.</item>
            <item>3.) Take a snapshot to capture version history for git (This is on the Utilities page menu: "Make a Data Snapshot").</item>
            <item>4.) Assess whether pdfs, epubs, and html need to be republished immediately. If so, then do it manually using utilities. If not, then wait for
              the next change that warrants a republishing of the text. Especially minor changes may not warrant updating all the publications as texts will be
              updated periodically, and the change will be added eventually.</item>
          </list>
        </p>
        <lb/>

        <p>Whenever you make changes to a published text, you should always change the version number from project management. When you start working on a text
          in markup use a version number beginning with 0.1.1. Generally, we don't need a versioning history while the text is in the markup process, however,
          if the markup for a text is particularly complex, e.g., it is a very large text, it includes attributes that require us to come up with new markup
          language, it includes a complex outline structure, etc., you should occasionally update the version (e.g., 0.1.2) from project management as you
          processes different stages of the markup. In such cases, it would also be a good idea to occasionally save a backup locally to your computer. This way
          we can track the text, and especially have a way of knowing what version it is in case something goes wrong (which does happen from time to time).</p>

        <p>Sometimes there may have been an edition or correction that was made in an earlier version of a TEI file that was made in error or for some other
          reason we need to check that changes that were made in an earlier version of a document. In such cases, all the older versions of the XML are saved as
          snapshots in 84000's Github repository. To check older versions of the TEI please follow these steps below: </p>

          <item>Once you navigated to the file you need click on the "History" button. This will take you to a new screen showing you a history of all the
            snapshots of the file, called "commits" on Github.</item>
          <item>By clicking on each commit, it will show you all the additions and deletions that were made to the file at that time. The version number update
            should be close to the top of the page. From here, it is very convenient to see what changes have been made to the file for each version update. </item>
          <item>Or you can simply download that version of the TEI file by first clicking on the three dots ... to the right of the file name of that version,
            click "view file", the new screen click on the "download" button. (Note that some browsers will just open the XML on a new page, so you might need
            to right-click "Save Link As..." to download the actual file.</item>
        </list>
        <p>All the older versions of the files should be here since the time we begin syncing this Github repository. Note that sometimes there may have been a
          few version updates before a commit, but there should be a record of all the differences between the version at the time of the commit and the
