        <head>General Remarks</head>
        <p>Here is the complete documentation for 84000 TEI Documents. In the body there is a list
          of all the specifications for element, model classes, attribute classes, macros, and
          datatypes. The back matter contains first a set of guidelines for our own markup editors
          showing the process for the markup stage of our texts, which is then followed by some
          other appendices with further topics and instructions for markup editors. All of these
          sections are accessible through links in the table of contents.</p>
        <p>NOTE FOR UPDATING THE SCHEMA: This ODD contains some content models that are written
          directly with RELAX NG in order to shape and restrict the form for published 84000 texts.
          If these need to be updated in the ODD, these content models, which outline the whole of
          the <gi>text</gi> are primarily to be found in the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for the
            <gi>teiHeader</gi>, <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, and <gi>back</gi> elementsSome RELAX
          NG content models are also defined in the a few <gi>macroSpec</gi> elements that are
          pointed to from within the content models of these four mentioned <gi>elementSpec</gi>s.
          All the the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s have been placed at the beginning of the ODD's XML after
          the <gi>moduleRef</gi>s and <gi>classSpec</gi>s, these are then followed by the
            <gi>elementSpec</gi>s. See <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.9">Appendix
            I</ref> for more details on proceedures for updating the schema.</p>

              text. The former deals with those responsible for the English translation and the

          <remarks>
            <p>For 84000 texts, the <gi>bibl</gi> element is used for each bibliographic entry in
              the bibliography within the <gi>back</gi> section of the text. However, in each 84000
              text the <gi>bibl</gi> element is also used once in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> to
              describe the bibliographic information for the 84000 text itelf; in this case the
                <gi>bibl</gi> is more elaborate and contains several child elements, see the second
              example below:</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>
              <gi>body</gi> (text body) contains the whole body of a single unitary text, excluding
              any front or back matter. So in an 84000 TEI encoded document, the body contains the
              whole translated text. It does not material written by the translator or editors, but
              just the original text in translation. It is part of the <gi>text</gi>, coming after
                <gi>front</gi> and before <gi>back</gi>. The body section opens approximately the
              same way in every document. The front closing tag precedes the body opening tag. That
              is followed by the div tag with the type attribute containing the "translation" value.
              This is followed by the head elements, with type values first of "translation" and
              then "titleMain", and then "titleHon" as shown below. After this comes the chapter or
              section div's, and so on. Even if there is no chapter division in the body of the
              translated text, there is minimally one section or chapter div, containing then the
              whole of the translation, and closing before the "colophon". Structurally the colophon
              section is equivalent to a chapter, and colophon is a value of a type attribute of a
              div element. The colophon div closes and then comes the closing div tag of the
              translation, and then the closing body tag. </p>

              linguistically distinct, for example as archaic, technical, dialectal, non-preferred,
              etc., or as forming part of a sublanguage. <gi>emph</gi> indicates that the italicized
              words are not in a foreign language but are stressed or emphasized for linguistic or

            <p>Occasionally, for whatever reason the chapter numbers may need to be altered. <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">For example in Toh 543</ref>, many chapters 
              are skipped since a Sanskrit source was matched to the chapters in the Kangyur. The number needs to be displayed as such in the header but also needs to have the proper number prefixed in the table of contents and all the milestones contained
              within the chapter, all of which will be diverging from the number that is automatically generated by the parser. This can be done by adding a single @prefix attribute to the appropriate chapter's <gi>div</gi> element. e.g.:
              </p>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <div type="chapter" prefix="24">

                </div>
              </egXML>
              <p>So <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">this chapter and all its milestones will now display the "24" prefix in the reading room</ref> even though it isn't the 24th "chapter" division in the TEI file.

          <remarks>
            <p>
              <gi>div</gi> (text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a
              text. All three subsections of the Front are designated by a div tag, which includes a
              type attribute that holds a value reflecting which subsection it is, for example:
                <tag>div type="acknowledgment"</tag>. Likewise the body has a div tag marking the
              translation, and within the translation, at least two div's, making the main part of
              the translation and the colophon. Any further subdivisions of the translation, into
              chapters or sections require additional div tags. All of the tags also contain the
              type attribute and translation, chapter, section or colophon values. This works the
              same way for the back section, with four div tags, at least. Each again has the type
              attribute and values of notes, listBibl (within listBible at least one div with type
              section) and glossary. </p>
            <p> Note that a prologue<!--, epilogue, dedication,--> or colophon section should be marked as such, e.g., type="prologue" and not be labeled as "section". </p>
            <p> The following is the <gi>div</gi> structure of 22084-089-001, Toh 544. It shows only
              and all of the div tags in the "text", since there are no div tags in the teiHeader.

          <remarks>
            <p>Because of the particularities of electronic publishing, P5 Guidelines says that "the
              term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which
              substantive changes are made and fixed. The words revision and update, by contrast,
              are used for minor changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition. No simple
              rule can specify how ‘substantive’ changes have to be before they are regarded as
              producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed
              here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the
              intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. " For 84000
              texts, the element should include a version number or name and can include the
                <gi>date</gi> element. </p>

              second component of the fileDesc element and groups information relating to one
              edition of a text. It is an optional element, but recommended. It follows directly
              after the <tag>/titleStmt</tag>, and proceeds the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>. There are
              5 potential child elements that it can contain, but for 84000 texts, the only child
              element is the <gi>edition</gi> tag, and that element contains in turn the
                <gi>date</gi> element, the grandchild of the <gi>editionStmt</gi> element.</p>

            <p>For 84000 texts, our parser italicizes text within this element. In the mark-up
              process, text that should be italicized but does not fall into the category of foreign
              text (tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element) should be marked up either with the
                <gi>distinct</gi> or <gi>emph</gi> element. <gi>distinct</gi> indicates that the
              italics identify any word or phrase that is not foreign, but is regarded as
              linguistically distinct, for example as archaic, technical, dialectal, non-preferred,
              etc., or as forming part of a sublanguage. <gi>emph</gi> indicates that the italicized
              words are not in a foreign language but are stressed or emphasized for linguistic or
              rhetorical effect.</p>
            <p>
              <gi>emph</gi> is also used for the word "Warning" in the tantric restriction within
              the <gi>availability</gi> element, and here it should be given the <att>rend</att>

              <remarks>
                <p>Note that sometimes there may be some overlap between what distinguishes the italics tag used for a “term” vs. a “quote.” In such cases you can use your own discretion, but in general italics used for a “term” are for specific a word or phrase that is left untranslated usually because it is technical, untranslatable, or for some other reason. 
                  In contrast the italics used for a “quote” are for italics used for a word or phrase citing a specific instance in a source text either to corroborate the English translation, or to note some difference between two or more sources. 
                  Both tags are rendered the same in the end, so this isn’t a critical call to make. There is no need spend time looking up italics to determine whether or not they are found in sources, but just keep this general principle in mind when distinguishing the proper tag for italics.

          <remarks>
            <p>84000 uses this element to tag foreign words throughout documents with exception for
              the titles of texts, which should be tagged with the <gi>title</gi> element. All
              instances of the <gi>foreign</gi> element must contain the <att>xml:lang</att> with
              its value following the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1
              codes</ref>; however, for any language that is not usually written in a Roman script
              (i.e., Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Pali, etc...), if the language is written in a
              Romanized script then the first letter should be capitalized and "-Ltn" should be
              added to the value. For example Sanskrit "sa" becomes "Sa-Ltn", Tibetan "bo" becomes
              "Bo-Ltn", Chinese "zh" becomes "Zh-Ltn" and so forth. But use, the regular ISO 639-1
              code if the native script is used (usually this should only be the case with Tibetan
              "bo" or Chinese "zh"). Most instances of the <gi>foreign</gi> element should include
              the <att>type</att> attribute detailed above, although there are a few exceptions when
              foreign text will not fall into the "term" or "quote" category and this
              attribute is not needed, for instance, the case of Tibetan Wylie transliteration given
              in parenthesis after the phonetic rendering of a Tibetan name. However, in general
              romanized foreign names should not be tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element. This
              tag should only be used for foreign text that are to be italicized according to
              84000's style guidelines, as our parser will italicize all instances of foreign text
              in the web display. There is one exception to this, in that text in the Tibetan and
              Chinese script should be tagged with the <gi>foreign</gi> element, but will not be
              italicized in the parser.</p>

            <p>The <gi>front</gi> (front matter) contains any prefatory matter. It is the first
              section of the <gi>text</gi> structure, so it comes after the <gi>teiHeader</gi>,
              which is outside of the <gi>text</gi> itself, and before the <gi>body</gi>, which is
              the second part of the <gi>text</gi> proper. The front matter of an encoded text
              should not be confused with the TEI header. The TEI Header, serves as a kind of front
              matter for the computer file itself, not the text it encodes. The <gi>front</gi>
              contains the written material that does not form part of the translated text,
              including the summary, acknowledgement and introduction (in that order). These three
              sections in the <gi>front</gi> are nested within <gi>div</gi> elements which each are
              appropriately labeled by the value of their <att>type</att> attribute, as in the

          <remarks>
            <p>In the glossary found in the back material of each 84000 text, the <gi>gloss</gi>
              element wraps each glossary term with its variations in Tibetan and Sanskrit along
              with a definition. The <gi>gloss</gi> element is requires the <att>xml:id</att>
              attribute, and the <att>type</att> attribute declaring whether it is a "term",
              "person", "place", or "text". The first <gi>term</gi> element (which has no attributes
              and presents the English translation of the term) will create a link to the glossary
              in the reading room for each instance of that term as it appears as a string in the
              text. However, in some cases it may be inappropriate to link certain strings of text
              that match this term and so optionally the <att>mode</att> attribute may be added with
              the values of "marked" or "match". A <gi>gloss</gi> element with the mode "match" will
              match with all instances of that string in the text unless they are marked with
              &lt;term type="ignore"&gt;. A term in the glossary with the mode "marked" will only
              link to terms with the <gi>term</gi> element. of the term, that are marked also by
                <gi>term</gi> tags the type attribute with the value of "alternate".</p>
          </remarks>
          <remarks>
            <p>There also may be occasions were the translator has used alternate translations for
              the same term, or different variations for the spelling of a string that correspond to
              the same glossary entry. In this case an additional <gi>term </gi> element should be
              added with the value "alternative". This will cause the parser to link these alternate
              string instances of the text in 84000's reading room.</p>

            <p> Unlike the div tags, the text between the opening and closing head tags are visible
              to the reader. So any major section of the front, body or back parts of the text that
              has a title, wraps that title in a head tag. Head tags need to follow directly after a
              div tag, or another head tag. Head tags have type attributes with values that often
              match the text between the tags. You can see this in the following snippet, from the
              front part of UT22084-060-008.</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>In 84000 texts the <gi>hi</gi> element is only used to render (1) "small-caps", (2) "subscript", and (3) "superscript" text. 
              Generally these will be used as follows: (1) "small-caps" Latin capital
              letters are to be used in the abbreviations for Current Era (CE) and Before Current Era
              (BCE). (2) According to <ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">the Vienna Kangyur sigla system 
              </ref>, the second letter sometimes uses a subscript letters. (3) There isn't any regularized use for superscript (superscript
              footnotes are genrated by the parser and do not need to be entered in the TEI), but for miscellaneous reasons they might be needed,
              in which case a <gi>hi</gi> <att>rend</att>="superscript" may be used. 
              Note, for "small-caps" in the XML markup, use the lowercase letters, e.g. "ce", they will be rendered as uppercase in the display. 
              However the "subscript" and "superscript" should use lower case or upper case according to the proper sigla or text. See examples below:</p>

            <p>In 84000 documents the <gi>idno</gi> element is only used in publication statement.
              It is used to identify the document by supplying a <att>xml:id</att> attribute, and
              should be placed just after <gi>availability</gi> inside the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>.
              When the XML is saved to 84000's database, the <att>xml:id</att> attributes throughout

            <p> Unlike section or chapter tags, label tags do not result in a real structural

              label tag is a less obtrusive heading tag, labeling parts of texts, and not
              designating major sections. <gi>label</gi>s will appears in bold text in a slight
              larger type than the rest of the text, but the same color and same font. </p>

              <desc>These "type" values are used to identify the types of lists used in various
                places throughout the text: "glossary" is applied to the main list in the glossary,
                "abbreviation" is applied to the list of abbreviations within the notes section of
                the text. In addition to these two standard lists, the <gi>list</gi> element is also
                used for any outlines, bulleted lists, or other lists that appear with the actual
                text itself. In this case, the type attribute with the value "section" or "bullet"
                should be used, and this will effect how the list is displayed by the parser. The
                type value "section" will render a list of sections, with some vertical spacing
                between each item in the list; this is ideal for lists where each item is a
                paragraph or longer. The type value "bullet" will render the list with indentation
                but without vertical spacing; this is ideal for short items with identifiers (it
                isn't necessary that there be an actual "bullet" before each item, this is just the
                name we are using to distinguish the type). The latter two list types may also be
                used in combination to create an outline. For instance, see the sample of XML markup

                    absence of fixation with respect to all phenomena, all meditative experiences,
                    all causal attributes acquired by bodhisattvas, all fruitional attributes
                    manifested by buddhas, and all attainments up to and including omniscience.
                    along with unconditioned phenomena, such as the abiding nature of all things and
                    the finality of existence, these are all attributes with respect to which a
                    great bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment. Bodhisattvas do perceive
                    such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative level; in an ultimate sense
                    they consider them to be illusory, in the manner of a dream and so forth. </p>

                    bodhisattvas should train so as to understand that they are all
                    non-apprehensible—mere designations and conceptualizations. </p>

              the <att>type</att>="section" or <att>type</att>="bullet" must be used. In the web

          <remarks>
            <p>The mantra element is used to document any instance of a mantra string. Note that the parser will italicize
              mantra elements in dependence upon its <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. It will be italicized for any language 
              value other than "en" (English) or "mixed". If the mantra is "mixed", that is to say fragments of it are represented
              in more than one language, then those fragments should be further distinguished within the <gi>mantra</gi> 
              element with child <gi>foreign</gi> elements (except for English, which is the default). In this scenario,
              the italics will then be rendered according to these child <gi>foreign</gi> elements rather then the <gi>mantra</gi>
              element itself.</p>
            <p>Note, that the <gi>mantra</gi> element is also used to wrap single or multiple seed syllables referenced
            in the text and should be labeled <att>type</att>="syllable" in such cases.</p>
            <p>If the text ever clearly defines a string as a "dharani", "vidya", "vidyamantra", or "secret mantra", etc... then this should be indicated by a <att>type</att>
            ="dharani", "etc." attribute.</p>
            <p>Because mantras are presented in many different styles and scenarios a guide for how to mark them up is documented

          <remarks>
            <p> In the texts, we use the milestone tag to develop as artificial demarcations of the
              text that will eventually allow people to refer to parts of a text in a somewhat
              standardized manner. Because there are no consistent natural break points in the
              original Tibetan texts, the 84000 team decided to use milestone tags. They represent
              small amounts of texts that are in someway semantically cohesive. They are not tied to
              a specific text length, but they are not more than a few paragraphs. <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.4">See the instructions for entering

                  sublime palace in the Heaven of Joy, intentionally entered the womb, and sojourned

                  fencing, archery, feats of physical strength, and wrestling, demonstrating his

                other language sources and these should be indicated with a type attribute to distinguish them from 
                the Dege folio references. When a text spans two or more volumes, there should be a &lt;type="volume" cRef="V_"/&gt; 
                at the beginning of the new volume.</p>

                  For example, some of the folio refs for the Sanskrit in Toh. 11 are hidden in this
                  way, but there is a note about their availability in the text's introduction. See

                <p>This attribute is needed for Kangyur (or Tengyur) folio references that do not

                  erroneously link to that folio in the eKangyur according to the <att>cRef</att>.
                  When the <att>work</att> attribute is present, the parser will create a link to

            <p>First, most commonly, the <gi>ref</gi> element is used to mark all folio references
              and bampo references in the text that correspond to the physical Dege pages. The
              actual reference number should be placed in the <att>cRef</att> attribute. This should
              always follow the format: F.[folio number].["a" for the recto (front) side or "b" for
              the verso (back) side], for example "F.82.b". Bampo references should be accompanied
              by the <att>type</att> attribute with the value "bampo" and follow the format "B[bampo
              number]", for example:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <p tid="81">
                <ref cRef="F.1.b" type="folio"/>

            <p>Folio/page reference numbers referring to additional language sources should be marked 
            as such with the @type attribute. If there are a lot of these in order to distinguish these 
            from the square brackets of the Tibetan refs, curly brackets will need to be used instead.
            since the @cRef attribute will automatically display square ones, the reference should be 
            placed with in the node and the @cRef should not be used:</p>

            <p>Note, there are some texts that are duplicated in multiple sections of the
              Kangyur. For example The Prophecy of Sri_Mahadevi is found twice in the Kangyur as
              Toh. 193 and 739. Theses are both word for word exactly the same, but the folio
              references are going to be different for each duplicate version of the text. So in
              this situation we just use one TEI file, "061-014_toh193,739" but the folio references
              are differentiated with the <att>key</att> attribute which will relate each individual
              <gi>ref</gi> to the corresponding <att>key</att> that is declared within that
              version's <gi>bibl</gi> element found in the TEI's initial <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. For
              example, in 061-014_toh193,739's <gi>sourceDesc</gi>:</p>

              Now the parser will only display the appropriate folio references, e.g., when
              you click on Toh. 193 it will show the references for Toh. 193 but not those for 739
              and vice-versa.

            Dom about the best markup and method for doing this:
          <exemplum>
            <p>If a single <gi>cell</gi> needs to span multiple rows or columns, then this may be done by adding a <att>rows</att>
              or <att>cols</att> attribute respectively to that specific <gi>cell</gi> with the numeric value for how many rows/columns to span, for example
              see <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh361.html#UT22084-077-002-50">Toh 381 at i.20</ref>.
              The markup for this table is as follows; notice that an empty <gi>cell</gi> element is used in the corresponding spaces over
              which the spanning cell, "day yoga," spans:</p>

          <remarks>
            <p>Tables contains an optional heading and a series of <gi>row</gi>s. 
              Currently there is no need to distinguish how the table should be rendered,
              but as this becomes necessary, any rendition information should be supplied using the global <att>rend</att> 
              attribute, at the table, row, or cell level as appropriate. Currently no <att>type</att> is
            being used, but this may be added to the schema and documentation when it becomes necessary.
            Cells and rows should be assigned <att>role</att>="label" if they are considered to be the label or heading
            in which the subsequent <gi>cell</gi>s are considered to be data relevant to that label. If a <gi>row</gi>
            contains the <att>role</att>="label" attribute, then all of its child <gi>cell</gi>s will be considered
            to be "label"s as well. </p>
            <p>Note, when marking up <gi>table</gi>s the markup editor should check that the table renders properly
              in the reading room's web display. In addition, the table needs to be checked in the ebook display as well.
              This can be done by adding the code: <code>?viewmode=epub</code> to the very end of the url address on the
            utilities page. In truth, the tables are not compatible with the ebook format, so the parser will instead display 
            them as a bulleted list. The information in this list should be presented in a complete and eloquently readable way,
            otherwise the parser should be updated.</p>

              header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>) is the ‘virtual title page’ of a TEI document. It contains
              meta data (information about the TEI document). <gi>teiHeader</gi> is the first,
              mandatory child element of the root <gi>TEI</gi> element; therefore, it appears at the
              top (‘at the head’) of every TEI document. The header meta data provides: 1.
              bibliographic record of the electronic text as well as the source from which the
              electronic text is derived 2. documentation of the encoding and editorial principles
              used in tagging the electronic text 3. terms for indexing, searching, and retrieval 4.
              a record of changes made to the electronic document. The header contains many
              specialised elements not found anywhere in the ‘body’ of a TEI document (that is,
              everything after the close of <gi>teiHeader</gi>). These elements allow for highly
              structured descriptions of the document. Many parts of the header allow free-form
              prose descriptions as an alternative to the highly structured descriptions. Few header
              elements are required, so a header can be quite minimal." </p>

              the text. This first <gi>term</gi> element indicates to the parser which word or
              string of text to link to the glossary entry, and it will create a link for every
              instance of that term that is found in the text. The next <gi>term</gi> elements that
              follow within the <gi>gloss</gi> list the Wylie, Tibetan, and Sanskrit for that term,
              all indicated by the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute with the appropriate value. After
              that a definition is given in its own <gi>term</gi> element with the type="definition"
              attribute. Finally, if there are any alternate translations used for the term within
              the text that should be linked to this gloss, they are listed last each marked by
              type="alternative". These instances of alternative strings of text will also be linked
              to the glossary entry wherever they are found in the text. All of this can be seen in
              the first example below. For further notes about the glossary see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.3">Appendix C</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <gi>term</gi> element may also be used in the text itself to alter the way a
              string of text is to be linked to the glossary. For example, a string of text can
              bypass being linked if it is placed within a <tag>term type="ignore"</tag> as like the
              following example. Alternatively, if the parent <gi>gloss</gi> element for an entry is
              given the attribute mode="marked" then it will only link to instances in the text that
              are contained within a <gi>term</gi> element. If there are three or more glossary entries
              of the same string, then these may be more precisely distinguished within the body of text 
              by adding a @ref attribute pointing to the specific glossary entry to which they refer (In this situations
              the <gi>gloss</gi> entry should be <att>mode</att>="marked"). For more details on how the glossary
              functions on the web page see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.3">Appendix C</ref>.</p>

              additional title(s) from other sources, but these should be marked as
              type="otherTitle". Following the titles, there needs to be <gi>author</gi> elements
              given for each person or group involved in the translation of the text (these authors
              are the translators of the English, not the original translators of the Tibetan who
              will be listed later on in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>). After the <gi>author</gi>s, any
                <gi>editor</gi>s, <gi>consultant</gi>s, or <gi>sponsor</gi>s may be listed in that
              order. For these latter three, DO NOT leave empty elements as placeholders if they are
              not present.</p>

        <head>Checklist for 84000 TEI Markup Editors</head>
        <p>Following below  are complete step-by-step guidelines for marking up 84000 TEI. To reference how the 
          markup stage is integrated with the entire 84000 workflow, here is link to the <ref target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XtNBnI-RDWZ2KepY2R2mXPuada3-8xOVSCRTcB6B9Q/edit?usp=sharing">Editorial and Publications Workflow</ref> document.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Check the MS Word Document from Project Management</head>
          <p>According to our current workflow, when a text is passed to markup it should be already uploaded to
            <ref target="https://projects.84000-translate.org/index.html">project management</ref>.
            First click on the "Search" tab and locate
            the file using the Toh number. Once you have found the text click on "edit
            headers", from there you can expand the "submissions" section (The TEI will be generated from this same screen as well, see below). From here you
            may click on the document and download it in order to check the document from MS Word. 
            The copyeditors will have entered most of the proper style tags for foreign terms, verses, 
            some of the mantra markup, and so forth. However, when you begin a text
            it is important to double check the work and make sure the text has
            been entered properly into the template. Also, sometimes you may be asked to apply the style
            tags into the template yourself, so as you continue to edit TEI markup, you should occasionally 
            read the instructions in the copy editor's template and try to become familiar with them <ref target="http://translator-tools.84000-translate.org/index.html?tab=copy-editors">(The latest
            version of the copy editor's template may be downloaded here)</ref>. A lot 
          of the tags are set up to be tagged with character and paragraph styles from the template and automatically
          converted by a script into to correct markup. However, the copy editors may occasionally make some mistakes,
          and being familiar with the template will help you correct them and inform the copy editors
          of any issues. Remember, sections can always be corrected from the template, passed through the script again, 
          and pasted into the final TEI so keep the original word document open for reference while you work.</p>
          <p>When checking the document please follow check that the following is applied in the DOCX:</p>
          <list>
            <item>In general you can corraborate with the instructions written in the template.</item>
            <item>Check that the text has tagged the appropriate sections using the "Heading 1, 2, or 3"
              styles to outline the text. Make sure that the style “Heading 4” or higher isn’t used
              anywhere in the document, as that information will be lost in the conversion process.
              Any headings for fourth level subsections (or higher) written by the translator should
              be set to the “Normal” style in the style set and be tagged with &lt;level 4
              header&gt; or similar tags. These subsections will need to be manually created with
                <gi>div</gi> elements when you edit the XML. </item>
            <item>All the italics have been applied with the various character styles, "foreign-", "title-", etc.
              (don't worry though, if you miss some, those italics will be given a &lt;fix&gt; tag by the script).</item>
            <item>Because the markup for mantras has become a bit complicated, we have provided the
            copy editors an "Option Two" for applying style tags to all the mantras. This instruction
            was given in case differentiating the different "mantra" styles becomes too distracting 
            from the actual copy editing work. Under "Option Two," the copy editor will tag all of 
            the mantra italics with the character style "Mantra-Other" and you will need to distinguish 
            and apply the appropriate markup to the mantras. You can do this either now, while you are 
            checking the template, or you can pass the template through the script as it is and all the 
            mantras will be tagged &lt;mantra type="input type" xml:lang="input language"&gt; and you can 
            mark them up in the XML. However, I recommend doing this from the template as it will be 
            faster. You can quickly find all the "Mantra-Other" tags by doing an "advanced find and replace"
            and click on the Format --&gt; "Style" in the search dialog box. Leave the search bar empty 
            and you can quickly go through all the "Mantra-Other" styles in the entire template and apply 
            the correct style from the style pane. See instructions for the mantra markup in the template
            II. MANTRAS, pp 3–5, or see the full documentation for the mantra markup here in <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.6">Appendix B.6</ref>.</item>
            <item>All the verses have the "verse" paragraph style applied, and they are formatted correctly 
              with line breaks between lines and paragraph breaks between stanzas (change the display
              settings to show paragraph marks and line breaks so you can see more clearly whether
              they are formatted correctly).</item>
            <item>In some cases the copy editors may have left comments for the markup editors with
              the MS Word comments feature. The script will convert these into <gi>note</gi>
              elements that will have the "place" attribute with the value of
              "comment_from_copyeditor_to_markup_editor." I have intentionally set this up to be
              highlighted by the schema as an error, so that the copy editors may highlight any
              unusual formatting or other issues that need to be addressed by the markup editors.
              You may leave these in and address them as you work on the XML or alternatively keep a
              backup of the .docx and reference the comments from there. If you don't want to see
              them in the XML, make a backup of the .docx and select "Delete All Comments in the
              Document" from the review pane in Word before sending the document through the
              conversion script.</item>
          </list>
          <p>If the document looks good, you can go ahead and run the script, otherwise make corrections 
          and upload the document again. If so, please use the exact same file name but add "-v2" or "-v3"... etc.
          for any subsequent versions for example: "T747-bhutadamara-for-markup-apr-16-2020-v2". Upload
          it to project management with the /Submissions.</p>
          <p>Don't worry, you can always go back and do this again later on if you notice
          some problem in the DOCX.</p>

              click on the document you wish to run through the script, and in the next
              panel, there will be a checklist on the right side of the screen. Check the "generate
              TEI" box, and then click save. The app will perform the conversion and the output .xml file can be found in
              the 84000 Collaboration/apps/84000-import-data folder. There will be a unique folder
              created with the name of the texts xml:id number. Note that you can convert
              the glossary through this submissions form as well (although this should be done later
              after checking the document, see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.1_div.7">A.7</ref>).
             </item>
            <item>Occasionally the app may be down or the project management page may give you a
              permissions error. If it says that permission is denied you should email the lead
              technician who handles the server's permissions (Dominic). Alternatively, it is also
              possible to convert the word .docx created in the template through the <ref target="http://oxgarage.tei-c.org/">oXgarage website</ref> or <ref target="https://oxgarage2.tei-c.org/#">it's mirror site</ref>. Convert the file to a
              "TEI P5 XML Document" and run our own .xslt script on the document. The .xslt script
              is in apps/84000-import-data/xsl. (<ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.8">Instructions for running an .xslt script can be found in Appendix H</ref>)</item>

              <hi rend="bold">Checking the XML Conversion before You Begin Editing:</hi>
            </head>
            <item>This should create a file that is closer to what we want. However, the script is
              definitely not perfect, and many sections will need some reworking.</item>
            <item>If the "verse" styles were applied appropriately in the template, then the script
              should put them correctly into <gi>lg</gi> and <gi>l</gi> elements. It should also
              preserve and convert any italic markup within the verses. The script is able to do
              both because in MS Word the "verse" is a paragraph style and all the italic markups
              are character styles. However, for the script to work properly the individual lines of
              verse need to be separated by line breaks, and the stanzas themselves need to be
              separated by paragraph breaks. There are instructions for how to do this in the
              template, but this process can be a bit finicky, so you should double check some of
              the verses to make sure the conversion has worked properly. Refer to the section on
              the <gi>lg</gi> element to see how verses need to be formatted. </item>
            <item>Another note about the script to keep in mind is that the script is designed to
              automatically create divisions with <gi>div</gi> elements in the markup whenever the
              copy editors use the "heading 1," "heading 2," or "heading 3" styles in the template.
              This will create up to three levels of <gi>div</gi>s. As mentioned above any fourth
              level <gi>div</gi>s or further should be placed into tags by the copy editor and you
              will need to create the <gi>div</gi>s manually when you edit the XML. Occasionally,
              the copy editor will put a heading into the "heading 1" or "heading 2" style but they
              will mistakenly leave the paragraph break at the end of the heading's text in the
              "normal" style. The script generates the <gi>div</gi> elements according to these
              paragraph breaks, so in this case, it will not create the proper division. Usually it
              is easy enough to correct these in either the template .docx or in the .xml, but in
              some cases it may save you some time if you can identify and fix them before the
              conversion. For example, this happened in the bibliography of a text, and because the
              bibliography entries were nested with one <gi>div</gi> instead of two, the script
              rendered them into <gi>p</gi> elements instead of <gi>bibl</gi> elements as is
              required. </item>
            <item>The script has a section for making appendices, which should appear in the
                <gi>back</gi> after the bibliography. However, since not all the texts have
              appendices, and since appendices could appear in many different forms such as lists,
              outlines, Sanskrit sources, etc., the script only converts these into the minimal
              default paragraphs or verses. You may need to reformat the markup in the section
              extensively or paste it in from the word file and mark it up from there. If there are
              more appendices in the future, or a particularly large appendix that needs to be
              extensively edited, we will develop the script to convert the appendices in a more
              detailed way.</item>
            <item>If there is some unusual formatting or other issue that is preventing the script
              from converting the text properly, one strategy for isolating the problem is to divide
              the text into three pieces (front material, body, and back material), convert each
              section one be one, and then paste them into the final .xml. <ref target="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lVxX3YzQv1WC2fl0Sqb2G1jCdQte-q5t">For this
                purpose we have created a Dummy Template</ref> which is just the minimal format for

              and convert them one by one.</item>

            </head>
            <item> When you have finished converting the document into an TEI-XML file, it is time
              to transfer it into the translations folder. There should already be a placeholder
              file for each of the Kangyur and Tengyur texts. Go to 84000 Collaboration &gt; apps
              &gt; 84000-data &gt; tei &gt; translations, and you will see the "kangyur" and
              "tengyur" folders. Each of these folders in turn contain a "placeholders" folder and a
              "translations" folder. Find the placeholder file right click and select "cut" then
              move it into the sibling "translations" folder by right and select "paste" (don't use
              "copy" and "paste" as this will reset the files permissions). </item>
            <item> You can then begin pasting the text from the XML you just converted into the
              placeholder text. The placeholder files usually just contain the <gi>teiHeader</gi>,
              however, most of this is important information and should not be overwritten. The
              converted XML will have directions in the form of comments, which will tell you
              specifically what elements within the teiHeader need to be added to the placeholder,
              and which to be left as is. In general, try to preserve all pertinent information from
              both sources, and if there is any data that seems to be contradictory, comment out the
              additional data and make a note of this in your final list of notes and issues.</item>
          <item> The placeholder's <gi>titleStmt</gi> will require some extra attention; this
              contains the original collection of titles given to texts when the 84000 project first 
              begin. However, when translations for these texts are made there will likely be many 
              changes that need to be applied to the various titles. There may be additional alternative
              titles discovered through the translator's research, but there may be some alternative
              titles found in the placeholder file that the translator did not notice. So when merging
              the <gi>titleStmt</gi> in the converted XML with the placehoder please use the following protocol:
          <list>
            <item>Update any English title to the one used by the translator found in the converted XML.</item>
            <item>Preserve any alternative titles found in either the converted XML or the placeholder file.
                      Alternative titles should be labeled type="otherTitle"</item>
            <item>Make sure that the Sanskrit and Tibetan short titles, i.e., "otherTitles", are consistent with the 
          English title in terms of the prensense of the final "འི་མདོ།" or"-sūtra". These should be removed if the word "Sūtra" isn't
          also found in the corresponding short English title. This presence or absence of "Sūtra" is not significant 
          enough to warrant adding an additional "alternativeTitle"</item>
           <item>Sanskrit Titles should have the first letter capitalized.</item>
          <item>There should be a minimum of nine
          titles: 4 Main Titles (Sanskrit, Tibetan, Wylie, English), 4 Long Titles (Sanskrit,
          Tibetan, Wylie, English), and 1 Chinese. Any additional variant <gi>title</gi>s
          (whether coming from the converted file or already present in the placeholder) should
          be added after this as type="otherTitle". The actual order of the titles doesn't
          matter because the parser will display them in the same order no matter what order the
          XML is in, but if one or more of the nine default titles are not present, leave an
          empty element there as a place holder, e.g., &lt;title type="otherTitle"
          xml:lang="zh"/&gt;. Here is an example of the nine titles from Toh 83:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

          <item>Any straight single quote marks found in the Wylie should be changed to 
          right curling ones. Note that all the Wylie in the placeholder titles will need to be
          changed because they have been left as straight quote marks in order to make them
          compatible with research databases like BDRC when the translator is in the research
          phase for that text. However, in our publications we only use curled ones.</item>
          <item>After the titles the main translator or translator group will be listed in an 
          &lt;author role="translatorMain"&gt; along with the phrase "translated by... under the patronage and
          supervision of 84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha." This should be added
          below the last title and it will be corroborated from project management, as will be discussed below.</item>
          </list>
          </item>
            <item>Also check the original word document for additional titles as the
              conversion script is quite rigid, and some of them might disappear if they were not
              entered properly.</item>
            <item>Alternatively, if you prefer, the titles can also be edited from <ref target="https://projects.84000-translate.org/index.html">the project management
                page</ref> using the original .docx as a reference. The project management page is
              linked directly to the teiHeaders in the XML.</item>
            <item>Occasionally, there will be a Chinese summary in the placeholder file, this should be merged into the 
              TEI by placing the Chinese summary in its own <gi>div</gi> immediately after the English summary, for example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            <item>Note if Chinese characters are found in the sponsorship statement in the Acknowledgements: Sponsors are asked for what statement
            they would like give in the publication. Occasionally, these may be given in Chinese characters without translation or transliteration.
            For example <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html#acknowledgements">here in Toh 543</ref>. So if you see this in the acknowledgements it is perfectly acceptable if that is what the sponsors request. Although,
            if you see it like this do make a note in the Reading Room Revisions sheet to confirm their choice in the final proofing stage.</item>

              "edit headers."</item>
            <item>From here there are various forms that may be used to edit the <gi>teiHeader</gi>. Note that
            any changes made here, after clicking on the "update" button, will be applied to the TEI file itself. You can 
            use these forms to update the "titles," "location," and "status" in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>. Note that previously,
            markup would also edit the "contributors" tab, but now this is all handled by the work-flow manager (Line) and 
            so in general, you do not need to concern yourself with the contributor fields or edit them in the TEI; however, do 
            confirm that the "Translator Team" has been selected from the contributors tab and that the corresponding
            author tag appears in the correct format in the TEI markup. In the TEI this will appear
            as &lt;author role="translatorMain"&gt; with a  <att>ref</att> id, including the name of the translator(s) or group 
            followed by a <gi>lb</gi> (only seen in the TEI) and the phrase "under the patronage and
              supervision of 84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha." For example in Toh 83 this appears as: 
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                <author role="translatorMain" ref="contributors.xml#team-16">

                            </egXML>
            It is important that it follows this format along with the accompanying statement as
            this will be displayed on the cover page in the Reading Room.</item>
            <item>Click on the "status". From this window you will be able to see various features
              regarding the text's status, some of which corresponds to data in the
                <gi>teiHeader</gi>, and some of this data is contained in separate data files. In
              the right column you will see a checklist for "Current Tasks". Here you can see the
              text's current stage within the work flow. You may "add to current tasks" as needed. </item>
            <item> To display the text on the Utilities page, you will need to change the "status"
              attribute within the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>. It should be at "2.b" during the
              copyediting phase, and now for the markup you should change it to "2.a." (Although it
              has probably already been updated by the script). "2.a" is the markup stage, when you
              are completed with all the markup, it will be reviewed one more time by the lead
              markup editor and then then they will update the status to "2", ("Markup Completed,
              and awaiting final proofing before release"). The text will now appear on <ref target="http://utilities.84000-translate.org/translations.html">the Utilities
                Page</ref>. Here you will be able to see how the text will be displayed on the
              webpage before it is published on the official 84000 page. Click on the link that says
              "html" next to the text to see the web display.</item>
          <item>At this point the <gi>teiHeader</gi> should be more or less complete. Since the
              merge process is a bit complicated, you may refer to the <gi>teiHeader</gi> in Toh 83
              for reference. All the headers should follow the same format that has been used in Toh 83.</item>

            <item>The schema should already be applied to the placeholder file, but if you need to
              apply the schema directly it is located in “84000 Collaboration &gt; apps &gt;
              84000-data &gt; schema &gt; current &gt; translation.rng.” You will see any schema
              errors as red bars on the right column in the oXygen window. Checking the schema is
              the best way to see if the XML is going to work correctly in the parser. If later on
              you have trouble saving to the database, or if you can save to the database but the
              web page does not display the text, then start by checking for schema errors in
              oXygen. If it says that there is an error where you don’t think there is really an
              error, but you need to check the XML on the web display, you can comment-out that
              section with comment tags:<lb/> &lt;!-- --&gt; (or highlight and press Ctrl-Shift “,”
              on PC or Command-Shift "m" on mac). Then you will be able to temporarily block all the
              seeming schema errors to help identify the problem. </item>
            <item>You will initially see many schema errors for some missing attributes such as
              "xml:id"s and "tid"s. Note that all "xml:id" attributes, "tid" attributes in the
                <gi>p</gi> elements, and "index" attributes in the <gi>note</gi> elements will be
              added automatically when you save and reload the XML, so you don't need to worry about
              adding these. However, in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> within the <gi>publicationStmt</gi>
              there is an element for the id number for the text, <gi>idno</gi>. This should have been
              already present in the placeholder folder, however if it is missing retrieve it from your
              manager and enter it in manually as this is needed to generate all the xml:id attributes
              in the text.</item>
            <item>In case there is an error in any of the "xml:id" or "tid" attributes due to
              duplicates, then you can regenerate them by deleting any problematic ones, saving the
              file, and then re-opening. The "xml:id" and "tid" will be generated wherever they are
              missing. If not, email the lead technician and they will make sure they are
              regenerated. It is fine if the "xml:id" attributes are not in order as long as they
              each have a unique value.</item>

            </head>
            <list>
            <item>While editing the XML, I usually use a previously edited and published TEI
              document as a model to make sure everything is formatted in the same way. This can be
              helpful, especially if this is your first time marking up a text or if you haven't
              done the markup for some time. Toh 83 is our go to as the standard for markup. This
              is a simple text, one of our earliest publications, and the first place we look when assuring
              that our markup is consistent. Toh 83 is a good standard, although because it is a simple text
              it may not have references for how to deal with the markup used in special cases.
              Here are some other texts with published TEI, which you may refer to for specific markup situations:
              <list>
              <item>For a text containing a lot of mantras: see Toh 431</item>
              <item>For a text with a complex outline (containing 6+ levels of <gi>div</gi>s): see Toh 1-1</item>
              <item>For a text with extensive Chinese quotations in the notes: see Toh 61</item>
              </list>
            Also, if you are looking for a specific element try right clicking on the published "translations" folder and
            searching for a specific example to reference, e.g., "&lt;table" to find a reference of the <gi>table</gi>
            element.
            </item>
            <item>In general, while going through the text, it is important to periodically refer
              back to the .docx you received from the copy editor. If the document has an unusually
              formatted outline, some portions of text may be lost in the XSLT conversion. A good
              way to check this is to open the original .docx and look at the outline of the text
              (on PC go to “View” and check the box that says “Show Navigation Pane”; on Mac go to
              “View” &gt; “Sidebar” &gt; “Document Map Pane”; this might be different for other
              versions of Word). For example, if there are any fourth-level headers or extra
              divisions in the summary or acknowledgements, these sections may disappear. It is
              particularly good to check the front material and the bibliography for anything
              unusual.</item>
              <item>The script will generate a placeholder for sponsorship in the "Acknowledgements" section, 
                as the comment from the script will say, this is just a placeholder for the sponsor 
                so the editors and Line remember to check the sponsorship with Jing Rui before publication. 
                If there is already sponsorship mentioned in the acknowledgements, you can remove the 
                placeholder, otherwise please just leave it as is, and Line or John will take care of 
                this just prior to publication.</item>
            <item>When you first get to the <gi>body</gi> of the text, you may notice that the title
              has been repeated with two lines containing separate <gi>p</gi> and <gi>milestone</gi>
              tags. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <body>
                  <div type="translation">
                    <head type="translation"> The Translation </head>
                    <head type="titleHon">The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra</head>
                    <head type="titleMain">Distinguishing Between Phenomena and Reality</head>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p> The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p> Distinguishing Between Phenomena and Reality </p>

                    <!--...body of the text...-->

                  </div>
                </body>
              </egXML> The reason for this, is the script has a safeguard to display any text within
              the first main <gi>div</gi> but not included in the first second level <gi>div</gi>. A
              not ideal consequence of this safeguard results in this repetition of the first two
              lines, which simply needed to be deleted manually. So the above example should be
              edited to look as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <body>
                  <div type="translation">
                    <head type="translation"> The Translation </head>
                    <head type="titleHon">The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra</head>
                    <head type="titleMain">Distinguishing Between Phenomena and Reality</head>

                    <!--...body of the text...-->

                  </div>
                </body>
              </egXML>
            </item>
            <item>If either one of the introduction, main translation, and/or bibliography have only
              one section you will probably see this heading at the beginning of their second level
                <gi>div</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <head>Main Section</head>
              </egXML> This is actually a placeholder from the template and should be removed, as
              the heading from the previous <gi>div</gi> element will provide the heading
              "Introduction" or "The Translation." </item>
              <item>All Kangyur texts begin with a homage, typically this should be followed by a line break <gi>lb</gi> between the 
              homage and the beginning of the text, which needs to be added manually:

            <item>If there were any italics that were missed in the copy editing phase, they will
              appear with a schema error in an element called "fix." You will need to manually fix
              these and replace them with the appropriate element, whether it be <gi>foreign</gi>,
                <gi>title</gi>, <gi>distinct</gi>, <gi>mantra</gi> etc. Sometimes these may be just italicized
              punctuation that the copy editor or author made by mistake, in which case you can go
              ahead and remove these tags.</item>
            <item>Check that all mantras have been properly tagged. Note, that any mantras that have 
            fragments of them written in more than one languages--usually English with Sanskrit seed syllables
            but this may also include Sanskrit/Tibetan mixed mantras--will be marked as such in the template
            and be converted to &lt;foreign type="Fragment-in-MixedMantra"&gt;. They will appear as errors
            in the schema which is a signal for you to wrap the complete mantra in a &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt;
            element. Then the @type="Fragment-in-MixedMantra" can be removed with the refactoring tool once they
            are all wrapped. <gi>mantra</gi>s need to be tagged in precise way, please see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.6">Appendix B.6
            for details on how to markup the mantras.</ref> </item>
            <item>Double check that the tag &lt;hi rend="small-caps"&gt; is used for any small
              capital letters in the text. This includes any abbreviations for CE ("Common Era") or
              BCE ("Before Common Era") in dates. Note that the lowercase letter needs to be used
              for small-caps, for example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> In the
                year 2000 <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi>
              </egXML> Then the parser will render this as small capital "BCE".<lb/> (If for some reason
              you ever need to add diacritics to small-caps, see details about this in the documentation
              for the <gi>hi</gi> element).</item> 
              <item>Note that some of
              the Kangyur sigla in the abbreviations and notes use subscript letters. For Kangyur
              sigla we use the Vienna system, which <ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">you can check the
                spelling here.</ref> Most of the sigla use a Capital letter followed by a
              lowercase one, but the sigla from the Peking Group, Mongolian, and Nyingma Kangyurs
              use a capital letter followed by subscript letters, and these second letters should
              have the &lt;hi rend="subscript"&gt; tag. Here either the lowercase or uppercase
              letter should be used according to the definitive sigla, for example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Peking 1737 PK = K<hi rend="subscript">Q</hi>, rnying rgyud bris ma = G<hi rend="subscript">bm</hi>. </egXML> Do not use
              any unicode for the small caps or subscript such as "ʙᴄᴇ" or "ᵥ" as this won't display
              consistently in the reading room for all browsers. The script should convert all
              small-caps and subscript from the template with the proper tag, if "small-caps" and
              "subscript" were applied in the template using MS Words Font dialog (Format &gt;
              Font), but these should be double checked in the XML.</item>
            <item>Typically there will be many left over "<gi>hi</gi>" elements after the script has
              converted the text. With the one exception of rendering small capital and subscript
              letters (as shown in the example above) we don't really don't use any of these
                <gi>hi</gi> elements in our mark up. Most of these are just remnants of formatting
              from the word document, and the script should convert all of these to
              type="wordfile-remnant". The refactoring tool is very helpful for removing them. In
              the oXygen menu go to "Tools" &gt; XML Refactoring, and then select "unwrap element."
              This operation removes the "<gi>hi</gi>" tags but leave the text within them
              untouched, however we only want to remove the &lt;hi type="wordfile-remnant"&gt;
              elements but not the &lt;hi rend="small-caps"&gt; and &lt;hi
              rend="subscript"&gt;elements. To do this, after selecting the "unwrap element"
              operation, it will ask us for the Target Elements (XPath). For this we should enter
              the XPath: <code>hi[@type="wordfile-remnant"]</code> This will only remove the
                <gi>hi</gi> elements with this attribute. Now you can click on "Next" and then
              "Preview". Note that it will ask you to save all opened editors, so be sure to close
              any editor windows that you don't want saved. The Refactoring tool is very useful for
              removing or changing other unwanted markup as well. However, use some caution when
              making global changes like this. You will want to make sure you aren't removing any
              important data. Using the preview mode, you can see how a command is going to effect
              the text. In most cases, we will want to remove all the "&lt;hi
              type="wordfile-remnant"&gt;" tags, but before using the refactoring tool to remove
              them, be sure to take a quick glance through the text and make sure the <gi>hi</gi>
              tags are not being used for a significant markup that may have been missed or
              unrepresented in the copy editing phase. If you are unsure, or if the <gi>hi</gi> tags
              are too messy to tell, save a backup copy of the markup before removing them with the
              refactoring tool, then you can check them once more after you finish marking up the
              text.</item>
            <item>Look for any weird tags that shouldn't be there like "type="endnote text"" or any
              other relics from the oxgarage/script conversion.</item>
            <item>Look for any mistakes: typos, mislabeled tags, etc.</item>
            <item>Note that ellipses are to be made with three periods and non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) before each of the periods. It should appear
              as a . . . but the first three spaces should all display "U+00A0" in the bottom right corner of the Oxygen screen. If you need to paste 
              them in use <ref target="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dV2yLATYg6qu4uRe8HCtG9HM9hk6gHqs/view?usp=sharing">this text file</ref> (The proper 
              spaces won't display in this HTML). Also note that the space after the last period should be a regular space 
              (U+0020) so it is still possible to have a break before the next word. Ellipses should be entered in this format by the copyeditors, they will 
            be carried through the scripts so you shouldn't worry about them unless you notice that they are in an improper format.</item>
            <item>As you do any major work on the text, it is a good idea to occasionally update the
              version number as a reference for file backups. For guidelines on how and when to do
              this, see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.10">Appendix K: Guidelines
                for Updating Versions of the TEI Document</ref>.</item>

            <list>
            <item>All the references such as [F.100.a], etc. need to be entered into <gi>ref</gi>
              elements with the "cRef" attribute, thus [F.100.a] should look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <ref cRef="F.100.a" type="folio"/>
              </egXML> Note that this is the standard we are using for all folio references: it
              should be an "F" followed by a period, a number, another period, and the letter "a" or
              "b." To put the bracketed folios into the <gi>ref</gi> element I usually use a search
              and replace with regular expressions. To do this open a find and replace box, check
              the "Regular Expressions" box and search for: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">\[(F\.\d+\.[ab])\]</egXML> Replace with:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                    <ref cRef="$1" type="folio"/>
                                </egXML> Or if they forgot to add the second period before that "a" or "b," like
              "[F.100a]", then search for: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">\[(F\.\d+)([ab])\]</egXML> And replace with: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                    <ref cRef="$1.$2" type="folio"/>
                                </egXML> Regular expressions are very useful for such tasks, just be careful not to
              search and replace any text or markup you did not intend to. For example, the
              introduction of a text might quote a folio reference number in the same format in
              which it was applied in the body of the text, say "[F.100.a]". We definitely don't
              want this instance placed into a <gi>ref</gi> element, so be careful not to
              inadvertently replace it with a "replace all" command. Usually when I do a search and
              replace, I replace a few individual items to make sure it is working properly and
              there aren't any anomalies before I do a "replace all" command. If you aren't familiar
              with regular expressions <ref target="https://regexr.com/"> this is a good reference
                website</ref>, and there are a lot of tutorials on youtube too. </item>
            <item>Sometimes there are other reference numbers used within the texts such as bampo
              numbers or page numbers referencing another source. All of these should also be
              placed in <gi>ref</gi> elements using the following conventions:
              <list>
                <item>Bampo references should be accompanied by the type attribute with the value "bampo" and follow the format "B[bampo number]", for example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <ref cRef="B1" type="bampo"/>
                  </egXML> 
                </item>
                <item>References to a Sanskrit, Chinese, or other source should be accompanied by the type attribute with the value "sanskrit", "chinese" etc. Typically
                  curly brackets should be used to differentiate the Sanskrit or Chinese references from the Tibetan ones. Because the parser automatically generates square
                  brackets around the cRef attribute, the inner node of the <gi>ref</gi> element should be used with typed curly brackets, for example:
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <ref type="sanskrit">{S1}</ref>
                </egXML>
                </item>
                <item>Note that whatever is placed in the @cRef attribute, will appear in square brackets in the reading room. Occasionally the author or editors may wish
                to hide a certain of reference number if they are deemed to be unnecessary for the general readership. In this case they may be given the attribute @rend="hidden",
                which will hide the reference in the reading room while still being marked in the TEI. For example this is done with some Sanskrit <gi>ref</gi>s in Toh 11:
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <ref cRef="1" type="sanskrit" rend="hidden"/>
                </egXML>
                  <p>Note, here it doesn't matter whether the cRef is used or the inner node is used since it will be rendered invisible in the Reading Room.</p>
                </item>
              </list>
            </item>
            <item>When a <gi>ref</gi> comes between two paragraphs, it is better to place it at the
              end of the preceding paragraph rather than the beginning of proceeding one, as this
              will be less distracting for the reader. The very first <gi>ref</gi>, however, must be
              placed at the beginning of the paragraph as there is no other choice.</item>
            <item>When a large text spans multiple volumes a volume reference should be added at the 
            beginning of the new volume just before the first folio reference of the new volume using the following format: 
            <code>&lt;ref type="volume" cRef="V__"&gt;</code>.
              For example in Toh 11, it spans to volume 32 at F.92.b:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <ref type="volume" cRef="V32"/> <ref cRef="F.92.b" type="folio"/>
              </egXML>
              <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh11.html#UT22084-031-002-1029">See how this is displayed in Reading Room</ref>
                                <lb/>
              * Usually the new volume will reset to F.1.b, but Toh 11 is a special case and continues with the numbering "F.92.b" 
              on the first page of volume 32. The volumes for the text will be marked in the <gi>location</gi>/<gi>volume</gi> element(s) in the located in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>.
            </item>  
            <item>There are some texts that are duplicated in multiple sections of the
              Kangyur. For example The Prophecy of Sri_Mahadevi is found twice in the Kangyur as
              Toh. 193 and 739. Theses are both word for word exactly the same, but the folio
              references are going to be different for each duplicate version of the text. So in
              this situation we just use one TEI file, "061-014_toh193,739" but the folio references
              are differentiated with the <att>key</att> attribute which will relate each individual
                <gi>ref</gi> to the corresponding <att>key</att> that is declared within that
              version's <gi>bibl</gi> element found in the TEI's initial <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. For
              example, in 061-014_toh193,739's <gi>sourceDesc</gi>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <sourceDesc>
                  <bibl key="toh193" type="text">

                </sourceDesc>
              </egXML> Then if you look at each individual folio references they will be
              differentiated by the <att>key</att> like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... <p tid="9">
                <ref cRef="F.246.a" key="toh193" type="folio"/>
                <ref cRef="F.230.a" key="toh739" type="folio"/> Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas. </p>
              </egXML> Now the parser will only display the appropriate folio references, e.g., when
              you click on Toh. 193 it will show the references for Toh. 193 but not those for 739
              and vice-versa. Sometimes the page breaks between the folios will be in the same place
              in the eKangyur but often they are different so you may need to go in and find them
              all manually if they were not written in by the translator.</item>

            <head>Keep an Eye Out for Unwanted Blank Spaces:</head>
            <p>This is unfortunately an issue that occasionally occurs through the conversion scripts. It typically happens when multiple 
              tags are set next to each other, such as the spaces between <gi>mantra</gi> tags and <gi>note</gi>s. Occasionally this will
              create an unwanted space that was not in the original Word doc. 
              We are currently working on improving the scripts to resolve this and prevent these unwanted spaces from being generated, but
              in the meantime keep an eye out for extra spaces, particularly ones that appear after a <gi>foreign</gi> or <gi>mantra</gi> tag
              and before a note or punctuation.
            </p>
            <p>For example see the unwanted spaces after the foreign term "mthong", and the ones before and after "khums" in the following example:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              Here the imperative thong (“admit / release”), however, could easily be a scribal error for <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mthong</foreign> , “behold.” 
              KY, K, and N have the imperative “subsume!” ( <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khums</foreign> ).

            <item> Within the notes section of the text the template and script will create an
              abbreviations section even if there isn't one. If there isn't any abbreviations
              section in the original docx. you can delete the abbreviations header but leave the
              section for notes. It should just look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <div type="notes">
                  <head type="notes">Notes</head>

            </item>
              <item>If the translator used Kangyur sigla in the notes but didn't create an abbreviations
                section, you may need to add one. See details for this in <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.8">Appendix B/Topics: Abbreviations</ref>.</item>
            <item>Any formal lists or outlines within the text should be marked up with the
                <gi>list</gi> element, which must also have the <att>type</att> attribute with the
              value "section" or "bullet." "Section" should be used for longer items of text, and it
              will render them with some vertical spacing between each item. "Bullet" should be used
              for shorter items and will create some horizontal indentation (it isn't necessary for
              there to be actual "bullets" in the list, this is just what we have named it). These
              types can be used in any combination to create an outline. For further details on
              outlines and some examples <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.3">see

              <item>There may be times when a stanza of verse was missed and not placed into "verse" tags
                when being copy edited in the MS Word template. If that is the case you will notice each
                line of verse appearing in <gi>p</gi> tags rather than <gi>l</gi> tags. It is good to
                refer back to the original Word doc if you are in doubt, from there it should be clear 
                according to the line breaks whether or not a stanza of verse was intended or not.

            <item>Occasionally there may be tables in a document. For instructions on how to markup tables 
              see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.5">Appendix B.5 Tables</ref>.</item>
            <item>Check that all the <gi>div</gi> elements are marked up with the proper
                <att>type</att> attributes. See the documentation for the <gi>div</gi> element to
              see the list of acceptable values. Note that a "prologue" or "colophon" should be
              marked as such and not as a "section." Also, each <gi>div</gi> should be accompanied
              by a <gi>head</gi> that has its own matching <att>type</att> attribute; however, there
              is one exception to this, &lt;div type="section"&gt; may be left without a
                <gi>head</gi> if the author did not provide one, this will usually be the case in
              the Introduction, Main Translation, or Bibliography whenever there is just one section
              and by default it is placed into a second level &lt;div type="section"&gt; wrapped
              within a first level &lt;div type="introduction"&gt; or &lt;div
              type="translation"&gt;. In this case the parser will read the <gi>head</gi>s from the
              main first level <gi>div</gi> and the second level &lt;div type="section"&gt; will not
              require an additional <gi>head</gi>.</item>
            <item>The script doesn't distinguish between chapters and sections, so the type value
              for all the "chapters" needs to be applied manually. Also, "chapter"s should contain a
                <gi>head</gi> type="chapter" element with some kind of enumeration, i.e., "chapter
              one," "chapter two," etc. If there is a formal title it should be contained in a
                <gi>head</gi> type="chapterHead" element following the first <gi>head</gi>. For
              example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <div type="chapter">
                  <head type="chapter">Chapter 32</head>

            <item>Some texts have <gi>trailer</gi>s at the end of each chapter, for example in Toh.

                  entitled “Cultivation.”</trailer>
              </egXML> Be default the script will convert every paragraph into a <gi>p</gi> element,
              so these <gi>trailer</gi>s should be manually applied if they appear at the end of
              each chapter. Please give each <gi>trailer</gi> its own milestone. </item>
            <item>All of the trailers will be separated by a space and italicized in their entirety by the parser, so any
                <gi>title</gi>s that appear in the trailer should be giving curled quotations marks.
              You will probably need to add these as the italicization could likely have been
              unnoticed in the copy editing phase. e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <trailer tid="1938">This concludes the first chapter, the introduction to the
                  tantra, in the glorious Caṇḍa­mahā­roṣaṇa tantra called “<title xml:lang="en">The

              appendix D</ref>). It is important to do an actual visual check of the milestones
          as they appear in the web display. From the Reading Room, take the perspective
          of the reader; there should be enough milestones to map out the text, but they should not be distracting
          to the actual narrative of the text.</p>

                    </label>
          <p>First, we need to check to make sure the Folio References displayed on the web page are
            in alignment with the eKangyur. This require some minimal knowledge of Tibetan, so
            please have another editor check this for you if you don't know how to read Tibetan.</p>
          <p>When you check the web display, go to the main translation and
            click on a folio reference, e.g., "[F.100.a]." This should cause the eKangyur text to
            pop up. Make sure that the eKangyur page that pops up is the correct page that
            corresponds to the English translation. You don't need to go through every folio in the
            text, just check the first two folio refs and the very last one.</p>
          <p>Most likely they will already be aligned from the original placeholder data and a correction will not be needed.
            However, due to a blank page or error in the eKangyur the alignment of the pages might
            be off by one or more pages. The alignment may be adjusted in the <gi>location</gi>/<gi>volume</gi>
            element found in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>; here the <att>start-page</att> and <att>end-page</att> 
            define the span of the folio alignment according to the pages numbers of the eKangyur.</p>
          <p>For texts that span two or more volumes, this will be defined by multiple <gi>volume</gi> elements
          and you should individual check the first and last folio for each volume. Then a &lt;ref type="volume" cRef="V_"/&gt; element
          needs to be added just before the first folio reference of the new volume. For example, Toh 11 spans two volumes:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <location work="UT4CZ5369" count-pages="788">
              <volume number="31" start-page="414" end-page="593"/>
              <volume number="32" start-page="2" end-page="611"/>
            </location>
          </egXML>
            and it jumps to volume 32 at F.92.b which is marked up as follows in the TEI:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <ref type="volume" cRef="V32"/> <ref cRef="F.92.b" type="folio"/>

            <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh11.html#UT22084-031-002-1029">See how this is displayed in Reading Room</ref>
                        <lb/>
          * Note, usually the new volume will reset to F.1.b, but Toh 11 is a special case and continues with the numbering "F.92.b" 
          on the first page of volume 32.

            Any missing or erroneous folio references will need to be corrected. If it is the eKangyur numbering that is different or in error, 
            there will be a flag on the Folio Utility page and the message, "Logically F.XXX.a/b" appearing next to the reference. You should just 
            make sure that our displayed <att>cRef</att> is the correct one for the official <ref target="https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W22084">W22084</ref> print and that 
            the English corresponds to the correct page in the eKangyur (whatever its page number might be). When the the eKangyur pagination is different from our official W22084 one, please
            note this in your list of final issues to be reviewed at the end of markup.

                        <hi rend="bold">***Special Case for Volumes 81, 83, and 88 of the Degé Kangyur/eKangyur***</hi> There is a
            variation due to the addition of texts in the post <hi rend="italic">par phud</hi>
            printings, which includes our eKangyur in volumes 81, 83 and 88, which are not in the
              <hi rend="italic">par phud</hi> printing such as W22084. In volumes 81 and 83, this
            only concerns some texts added to the very end of the volume, but for volume 88 the
            Bodhimaṇḍasyālaṃkāralakṣadhāraṇī (byang chub snying po’i rgyan ’bum gyi gzungs) has the same Tibetan title as Toh 509, but a different Sanskrit title (Toh 509 is
            Bodhigarbhālaṃkāralakṣadhāraṇī). While this is confusing, it is also presumably the
            reason why the extra text was inserted at this point. If the orginal translator used a
            par phud printing this then off sets Volume 88 by 17 folios for all texts after Toh.
            508. In this situation, because the folio references will not match up with those in the
            eKangyur, our solution has been to put use both folio references. The one that links to
            the eKanyur will be the default <gi>ref</gi> element and the <gi>ref</gi> that refers to
            the alternate printing (likely W22084) should have this stated by a <att>work</att>
            attribute within the <gi>ref</gi> element. See for example from toh. 520: </p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <ref cRef="F.41.a" work="W22084" key="toh520"/>

                all those contained in this same volume (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">XXXX, X</foreign>), are listed as being located in volume 
                XXX of the Degé Kangyur by the Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). However, several other Kangyur databases—including the 
                eKangyur that supplies the digital input version displayed by the 84000 Reading Room—list this work as being located in volume XXX. 
                This discrepancy is partly due to the fact that the two volumes of the <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gzungs ’dus</foreign> section 
                are an added supplement not mentioned in the original catalog, and also hinges on the fact that the compilers of the Tōhoku 
                catalog placed another text—which forms a whole, very large volume—the 
              <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vimalaprabhā­nāmakālacakra­tantraṭīkā</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dus ’khor ’grel bshad dri med ’od</title>, 
                Toh 845), before the volume 100 of the Degé Kangyur, numbering it as vol. 100, although it is almost certainly intended to come 
                right at the end of the Degé Kangyur texts as volume 102; indeed its final fifth chapter is often carried over and wrapped in 
                the same volume as the Kangyur <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar chags</foreign> (catalog). Please note this discrepancy 
                when using the eKangyur viewer in this translation.</note>

          <p>Please place the note in the introduction wherever it makes sense, for instance when explaining
            where the text is found in the Kangyur, and so on. Adapt it to the volume number, e.g., "gzung ’dus e", or 
            as appropriate if the text appears in two volumes. If needed you can see how it was adapted and 
            placed in the following examples that have already been approved by the editors of the texts:
            Toh 846, 846a, 847 (145), 848 (522), 980 (212, 520).</p>

          <head>Transform and Edit the Glossary</head>
          <list>
            <item>Note that there are now two format options available for the Glossary: (1) The
              Glossary may be entered into an Excel spreadsheet, ".XLSX" file type; or, (2)The glossary
            may be entered into the 84000 Glossary Template, ".DOCX" file type. There are some advantages for 
            using the template instead of Excel: (1) Italics may be tagged with the various styles (foreign 
            terms, titles, mantras etc...) from the template, which will then be converted into the proper 
            XML tags by the script. (2) The spell checker’s automatic underlining is available, unlike in Excel. 
            (3) You will be able to avoid the general glichiness of working in Excel (apostrophes, unwanted cells going 
            through script, etc...). The 84000 Glossary Template is posted on the <ref target="http://translator-tools.84000-translate.org/index.html?tab=copy-editors">Translator Tools page under the 
            "copyeditors" tab</ref>. If you wish, you may transfer the tables over in to this template (instructions
            for how to do so are explained within the template), however you should first check the Tibetan column
            in the Excel file for apostrophe errors (see below "Using a Macro to Correct Initial Apostrophes" or instructions 
            in template).</item>
            <item>Before transforming the glossary with the script, whether from Excel or the Template, make
              sure that the tables are formatted properly. In Excel, there should be three or four sheets labeled
              "Terms", "People", "Places", and on occasion there will be a fourth sheet that should
              be labeled "Texts", in the template these are preloaded tables with the same four headings.
              If the labels of the sheets/headings aren't spelled exactly like this, then  
              the script won't apply the correct <att>type</att> to the <gi>gloss</gi> elements.
              Each sheet/table needs to have five columns that are to be exactly arranged as follows: (A)
              Tibetan Wylie, (B) Sanskrit, (C) Translation, (D) Definition, and (E)
              Alternatives.</item>
            <item>Note that occasionally you may get a glossary with an additional column of
              Chinese terms. If this is the case, add Chinese as a sixth column (F). If you need
            to edit the Chinese from the table side by side with the Tibetan and Sanskrit, that is
            fine just be sure to move the Chinese column into the sixth place before you convert the
            file or else the cells will be applied incorrectly by the script.</item>
            <item>
              <hi rend="bold">Using a Macro to Correct Initial Apostrophes:</hi> When you receive a
              glossary file in an Excel spreadsheet format, it’s likely there will be hidden apostrophes in the wylie
              column. This happens when a straight apostrophe is typed at the beginning of the word,
              as in the case of an a-chung prefix, "འ". Excel uses straight apostrophes to override
              the cell's format when typing numbers so that it considers it as text. In the process
              it hides this initial apostrophe, although there actually is an apostrophe in the
              cell, i.e., it disappears unless one actually clicks on the cell and looks in the text
              box at the top of the screen. In some cases the translator may have entered two
              apostrophes by mistake, or put one where there shouldn't be one. In all cases, these
              will need to be corrected, as the translator should not use straight apostrophes in
              the wylie text at all, but only use left curving apostrophes (’) (otherwise the script
              will not display proper Tibetan Unicode below them). Interestingly, the invisible 
              apostrophes are not carried over if you copy a table and paste it into the Glossary Template,
              However, these initial apostrophes still need to be checked because the author may have 
              thought they had correctly placed one into the beginning of a cell, but then the apostrophe
              will have disappeared and won't get carried over to the Template. To make this check and
              fix any errors, you should run the
              following macro in Excel. This macro will convert each initial straight apostrophe.
              However, most often these are a spelling error in the wylie transliteration and will
              need to be corrected (each instance must be verified in a Tibetan dictionary). To make
              these instances easy to find, the macro also adds “111” so that it’s easy to make a
              search for these cells. The “111” is just a marker and will obviously need to be
              removed too.</item>
            <item>In case you don't know how to run a macro in Excel, there are many tutorials
              available on Youtube for both PC and Mac. There might be some differences depending on
              the version of your Excel software, but they should be pretty straightforward. You may
              be prevented from running a macro if the file is "shared"; you may have to go to the
              "Review" tab, click on "Share Workbook," and uncheck the box to share the file with
              other users (this might be slightly different on Mac). Then you should be able to run
              the macro without any problem. Here is the macro. Paste the following code into a
              module window and hit "run": <p> Sub AposChange()<lb/> Dim Rng As Range, Cell As
                Range<lb/> ThisWorkBook.Activate<lb/> Set Rng = Cells.SpecialCells(xlConstants)<lb/>
                Cells(Rows.Count, Columns.Count).Copy<lb/> For Each Cell In Rng<lb/> If
                Cell.PrefixCharacter = "'" Then<lb/> Cell.Value = "111 ’" + Cell.Value<lb/>
                Cell.PasteSpecial Operation:=xlPasteSpecialOperationAdd<lb/> End If<lb/> Next
                Cell<lb/> Application.CutCopyMode = False<lb/> End Sub</p>
            </item>
            <item> Here is an example. When you look at the spreadsheet you will see: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">’khor ba ’jig</egXML> But in the file there
              is actually a hidden apostrophe: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                '’khor ba ’jig</egXML>So after running the macro script it will become: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">111 ’’khor ba ’jig</egXML> In this example
              there should be no hesitation about what to remove, but in other cases you may need to
              check in the dictionary.</item>
            <item>Note this macro only runs on one sheet at a time, and it only works on the 
              first sheet in a .xlsx document, so you will need to copy the second and third sheet into new spreadsheet files,
              open each sheet separately in Excel, and then run the macro separately for each.

            an MS Word template in the future.)</item>

                  spreadsheets and it hasn’t worked, if this happens try saving the .xls as a .xlsx
                  with Excel and trying again. Also sometimes the Oxgarage will stop working and
                  then suddenly a week lately it will work again. Sorry, I know this is frustrating,
                  contact Celso or Mike if you are running into this hurdle.)</item>
                <item>4. Now take the .xml file converted from oxgarage and place it in the
                  “convert” folder on your desk top. Change the name of this .xml file to
                  “input.xml”</item>
                <item>5. Now we can run the script. The easiest way on the mac is to open an
                  application called IDLE, which comes with the python download. It should be in the
                  main Python folder after you install it.</item>
                <item>6. Open IDLE and go to “file > open” and open the
                  “convert-glossary-from-tei.py” file. This should open up a new window which will
                  show the script as a bunch of code. From this new window go to “Run > Run
                  Module”. This will run the script and create the converted file in the folder you
                  made with the name “output.xml”</item>
                <item>7. The script is finicky and often times it won’t work. Sometimes is will
                  break halfway through and the file will be incomplete. If you get an error message
                  open up the “input.xml” file with oxygen or any text editor. The most likely
                  problem is that there is an empty row in the spreadsheet that is causing the
                  script to break. For instance you will see in the text rows labeled as <row
                  n="1"> followed by a bunch of <cells> and then <row n=”2”> and so
                  forth. Most of the <cells> had the data from the .xslx file, but see if you
                  can find where the <row> is suddenly followed by a bunch of empty unused
                  cells. Delete those empty cells (just for that row) and try running the script
                  again. If it still isn’t working you can try sending it to me (Celso) and I can
                  try to find out why it isn’t working.</item>

              If you get the script to work, or have someone else convert it for you, you can then
              paste it into the XML text you are working on. Use another already-published TEI file
              as a model.</item>
            <item>The script should be able to convert all three sheets in the combined .xlsx file
              in one go and create the appropriate type attribute (term, person, or place) if the
              sheets were labeled properly. However, if one of the sheets isn't converting properly,
              try breaking the three sheets into three separated .xlsx files and converting each one
              individually.</item>
            <item>Edit the glossary. Note that when you save the file to the database it will add
              the “xml:id” automatically so you don’t need to worry about adding these. You will
              probably need to remove several empty <gi>item</gi> elements that were converted from
              empty cells at the bottom of each sheet. Also remove entries that were converted from
              the spreadsheet's headings i.e., Tibetan, Sanskrit, Translation, Definition,
              etc.</item>
            <item>If Chinese terms were in the sixth column of the table, those
              Chinese terms will be assumed to be Chinese characters and will be set to xml:lang="zh"
              by default. If they are actually romanized transliteration of Chinese then the
            <att>xml:lang</att> attribute should ="Zh-Ltn" </item>
            <item>Note that the database will also automatically generate Tibetan script and add it
              as a &lt;term xml:lang="bo"/&gt; element based on the Wylie glossary entries. The code
              should look within the glossary for any &lt;term xml:lang="Bo-Ltn"/&gt; and create the
              matching "bo" term wherever there isn't one. So be sure to save the file, close it,
              reopen, and check that the Tibetan entries have been properly added. </item>
            <item>Check for errors and make sure the tags are nested properly. Use a
              previously-edited 84000 TEI XML as a model. You might want to save it first so that it
              automatically adds all the attributes and so forth.</item>
            <item>If you used the spreadsheet, then by default the script will place all italics found in the
              definitions column into &lt;fix&gt; tags, and you will need to go in and
              change these into the proper tags and add the proper
                <att>type</att> and <att>xml:lang</att> attributes as needed. For the template
            these tags should all be generated according to the styles used within the template (or it
            will tag them with &lt;fix&gt; if any italics were missed).</item>
            <item>At this point all the basic editing for the Glossary should be complete. However, 
            there is still some work to be done regarding how the glossary terms are being linked within the text.
            However, this step is better done on step A.10 when you are going through and looking
            at the web display. This section will also refer you to Appendix C which explicitly 
            define the guidelines for how the Glossary terms are to be linked in the Reading Room.
            However, don't worry about this yet, the guidelines will step you through that process when you reach that stage
            at A.10 below.</item>

          <p>Next, optional soft-hyphens should be entered for any long Sanskrit chains. The
            guidelines for doing this are shown in <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.5">Appendix E: Guidelines for entering

        <div>
          <head>Add Links For References (Both In-Text and External)</head>
          <list>
            <item>Create links for any references in the text, e.g., "<hi rend="italic">see page
              ###</hi>" or "<hi rend="italic">see Bibliography</hi>." Links for in-text references are
              created with the <gi>ptr</gi> element and external references (to other 84000 texts or
              other web pages) are created with the <gi>ref</gi> element. Links to Kangyur/Tangyur texts that
              are not yet published should be marked with a the coded comment <code>&lt;Reference Toh #### F.###.b&gt;</code>.</item>
            <item>It is also important to check the introduction and endnotes for any intext references to chapters or 
            sections and add <gi>ptr</gi> tags anywhere the reader might want to follow a link. In the introduction the 
              translator may have pointed out sections of the translation using Dege folio references; unless these mentions
              are specifically referring to the Tibetan source text or the structure thereof, these folio references should be 
              changed to the milestone numbers generated in the Reading Room -- according to what can be referenced most conveniently by the reader.</item>
            <item>For further guidelines for
              creating links see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.4">Appendix B.4: Cross References and

          <head>See how the Text Looks on the Web Page</head>
          <list>
            <item>Go through the text again in web display, making sure everything looks
              okay.</item>
            <item>It is helpful at this point to put the web page in “editor mode.” This underlines
              the linked glossary terms for you. Otherwise, in the regular display, it underlines
              them but then they will disappear after a few seconds, which will be frustrating when
              your are checking the links. An additional benefit of editor mode is that all of the
              collapsed sections of the text (Intro, Translation, Notes, etc...) will be expanded by
              default, so that you can more easily search for terms in the web display with CTRL-F.
              To put the page in editor mode, simply add the following text to the end of the URL
              web address: <code>?view-mode=editor</code>
            </item>
            <item>At this point you should check to see that the glossary is linking to the right
              terms. In the summary and introduction in particular there may be many instances of a
              word linking to the glossary when it shouldn’t, for example in the phrase “in terms
              of…” the word “term” might link to the glossary for the technical meaning of “term”;
              or to take another example, in the phrase “with respect to…” the word “respect” might
              link to “respect” as in devotion (these are just two out of many examples).
              Note, the translator guidelines [G4] instructs translators to flag instances
              of glossary terms that are only relevant to specific passages with the “†” symbol. They
            are also instructed to specify glossary entries as verbs (vb), nouns (n), or adjectives (adj)
            in cases where the glossary entry is only intended to link to one form of the word and not others,
            for example "play" or "appropriate". If they have done so then, don't leave these markers in the 
            text, but replace them with the markup described in the following section. However, it is
            likely that a lot of these terms will be missed so you should also scan through the text in 
            editor mode for any of these improperly linked terms.</item>
            <item>Also check that the highlighted terms correspond to their definition given in the 
              Glossary. For example, although term ཁམས་ can refer to the 18 dhatus, it can also sometimes refer
              to the 4 or 5 elements (earth, air, fire, water and space--although usually the term འབྱུང་པ་/པོ་ is used for this set). Both cases may be translated by
            the English word "element," but if the definition only mentions the 18 dhatus, then 
            instances of the latter case of the 4 or 5 elements should not be linked.</item>
            <item>To fix these instances add the <tag>term type="ignore"</tag> tag to the ones 
              that should not be linked. Optionally the <att>mode</att> attribute 
              may be added to the <gi>gloss</gi>
              element in the glossary. If the mode is set to mode="match" (this is the default mode,
              by the way), you will be able to block strings in the text you don't want to link by
              marking them with this <tag>term type="ignore"</tag> tag. If you change it to
              mode="marked", it will only link with strings in the text that are tagged with the
                <gi>term</gi> element (you will need to mark each instance of the term individually
              in this case).</item>
            <item>In these cases you can save yourself some time when choosing between the "marked"
              or "match" modes. It is good to think about which mode will require the least amount
              of tags. Usually this will be the default "match" mode, but it varies from case to
              case.</item>
            <item>In some cases there may be three or more glossary entries with the same word.
              For example, if three people in the text have the same name. In this case, the 
              instances may be distinguished using mode="marked" and adding @ref ids to all 
              the instances of that name marked with a <gi>term</gi> element. <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.3">Please see
            Appendix C for details and examples of this.</ref>
                        </item>
            <item>If there are any instances in the web display where there is a term in the
              glossary that is showing "0 instances in this text" (in the right-hand column of the
              glossary), you should find out if that term is actually in the text. There may be a
              spelling error, a diacritic error, or some other reason why it isn't linking to the
              glossary entry. Sometimes there is a glossary term that really isn't in the text
              (possibly because it was in the introduction and later removed). If this is the case
              make a note about it in the final list of questions and issues to address when you
              have finished the text.</item>
            <item>There are several subtle points for polishing the final glossary. In some cases
              alternatives may need to be added to link particular terms and in some cases the glossary
              terms will need to be checked against the original Tibetan. So we have
              created a separate Appendix C that explains how the glossary works, along with a few
              further tips for editing it. <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.3">Please take a look at Appendix C here.</ref>

        <div>
          <head>Search Other Published Texts for Links to the Text You Have Just Finished</head>
          <p>As has been mentioned above, any cross references that should be linked to future publications have been marked by a coded comment:
            <code>&lt;Reference Toh #### F.###.b&gt;</code>. After the four digit Toh number the folio number is optional, you can also add "-#" if it 
            is a large text divided into chapters like the Vinaya, but the initial of this string up to the fourth digit of the Toh number must follow 
            this exact format. This is so the comment may be found in a search at the time when that future text is published.</p>
          <p>Conjointly, now that you have nearly completed the markup for a new text to be published, you should search through all of 
          the previously published texts for this same string with the Toh number of this text you are just about to complete. It
          is important that this step is done after the milestones have been finalized, as cross links usually will linked by targeting those specific milestones.</p>
          <p>To search for references in previously published texts, go to the data source explorer in oxgyen and right-click on the "translations folder" (For now
            just the Kangyur translations will suffice, but the Tengyur translations will need to be searched as well whenever we start publishing those).</p>
          <p>After right-clicking select "Find/Replace in Files". With this command you can search all the published files for the following string: 
            <code>
              Reference Toh ####
            </code>
                    </p>
          <p>(be sure that the "Ignore extra whitespaces" box is checked. This will ensure that the code is found even if it occurs across a line break.)</p>
          <p>So for example you would search <code>Reference Toh 0120</code> for Toh 120. Now you will find any cross references that need to be updated.
          Go into those texts and update those links by removing the comment and adding a <gi>ref</gi> that targets the URL of the appropriate 
            milestone. For guidelines on creating cross textual links see <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.4">Appendix B.4: Cross References and
              Links</ref>.</p>

          <head>Final Details</head>
          <p>A few final things to look out for while going through your final run of the text:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Check for extra unwanted blank spaces.</item>
            <item>Double check links and make sure they go to the right places.</item>
            <item>Make sure links aren't missing. Sometimes if the little "#" is missing or
              misplaced in the "target" attribute in the <gi>ptr</gi>s then the reference won't
              appear at all and you will see text like "(see above, .)" without anything coming
              after it.</item>
            <item>Do a search for comment tags that may refer to issues that haven't been addressed.
              To find them you can do a quick search for "&lt;!--".</item>
            <item>
            <list>
              <head>Search through the text and correct any erroneous straight apostrophes and quote marks. Note
                that the translator guidelines says to use typographical apostrophes and quote marks (‘ ’ “ ”) not straight ones (' ").
                All Wylie Tibetan transliteration of the a-chung character should use a right-curling apostrophe ’ not a left-curling one. 
                One exception to this rule is for strings of Sanskrit transliteration which may use a straight apostrophe ' to represent the avagraha 
                character; this is allowed so long as it is done consistently. Otherwise straight apostrophes should be avoided unless
                there is some pertinent reason to include them. These straight apostrophes and quotes are easy to miss and often can slip unnoticed into our publications,
              so please run the following searches before submitting your final markup:</head>
              <item>(1) Check for straight apostrophes ' : This is easily done with a search-and-replace command for the ' character. Just make sure you check
              each one, most of them will need to be replaced with right-curling apostrophes but some will need to be replaced with a left-curling one.</item>
              <item>(2) Check for straight double quote marks " : This is a little trickier as straight quote marks are used in the XML tags. To find them in the text and ignore
              all the tags open the CTRL/SHIFT/H, select "All open files" in the scope and search for the straight double quote " but in the field that says "Restrict to XPath:"
              enter the code <code>//text()</code> this will search for the straight double quote only in the text but not the tags.</item>
              <item>(3) Check for left-curling apostrophe in Wylie Transliteration: Again use the XPath/XQuery 
                and search for <code>//*[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(data(), "‘")]</code>
                                </item>
              <item>(4) Occasionally the unicode for a "modified word apostrophe" (U+02BC) may have been entered into the document. These
                look identical in the Oxygen editor and in most fonts in general. However they display inconsistently with each other in the Reading Room and can interfere
                with data searches in the Tibetan Wylie. Since this unicode has been depreciated in most word processors it is unlikely to occur, but you should check for any (U+02BC)s
                by searching the following character: <code>ʼ</code> and all of these should be replaced with right curling single quote marks (U+2019), which you can paste using 
                this character here: <code>’</code> (They look the same but they are not. Notice with the Unicode identifier at the bottom of the screen in Oxygen)</item>
            </list>
            </item>
            <item>Within the text's introduction and body <gi>note</gi>s should always be flush with the preceding character with no space between them.
              Occasionally, the <gi>note</gi> element may be separated by a linebreak in the XML when it is formatted or when it originally 
              went through the script. To correct these instances you can search the regular expression: <code>\s+&lt;note place="end"</code>
              and replace with <code>&lt;note place="end"</code>
            </item>
            <item>Check folio <gi>ref</gi>s inside <gi>mantra</gi>s. 
              There is currently a rare bug where if there is a folio reference, e.g., &lt;ref type="folio"/&gt; inside a 
              <gi>mantra</gi> element and that element is flush with the preceding <gi>p</gi> element, then the folio 
              ref will not link in the reading room. For example:<lb/>
              <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;mantra&gt;This is a mantra. &lt;ref cRef="F.102.a" type="folio"/&gt;&lt;/mantra&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              <lb/>
              In this example the folio reference F.102.a will not display the eKangyur when
              it is clicked in the reading room. In this rare situation where they are directly 
              next to each other (if there is any characters between them like a quote mark, space, or letter
              this problem doesn't occur), the fix for this is to simply put a single line break between the <gi>p</gi>
              and <gi>mantra</gi>. So from the example above:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <p>
                  <!--A line break is placed here in the XML-->
                  <mantra>This is a mantra. <ref cRef="F.102.a" type="folio"/>
                                    </mantra>
                                </p>
              </egXML>
              (This is a line break in the XML itself NOT an <gi>lb</gi> element). This will not
              alter the text in anyway as it appears in the reading room but it will fix the broken link for F.102.a to 
              the eKangyur.
              To search for this issue you can simple search with this regular expression: <code>&lt;p[^&gt;]+?&gt;&lt;mantra</code> .
              This will find any <gi>mantra</gi>s flush against the <gi>p</gi> element, and you can add the line break or just 
              ignore it if there is no <gi>ref</gi>s inside the mantra. 
            This is an issue that you should check if there are any formatted mantras in the text. Eventually we will bring this up
            with eXist to fix this bug, but in the meantime this should be checked like this at the end of markup.</item>
            <item>Address any final schema errors. Occasionally, the schema may need to be updated
              to accommodate a new type of formatting. Or, if a note uses a term in a language that
              hasn't been used in a published text yet, then that ISO 639-1 code may need to be
              added to the schema. In either case contact me about this (Celso) and I will add
              adjust the schema as needed.</item>
            <item>Note any formatting or anything else that just looks wrong or awkward.</item>
            <item>Make note of any grammar or editing errors that you think may have been missed in
              the copy editing phase. You can also add this to your final list of questions and
              issues.</item>

                            <lb/>
              As a final step run the series of automated tests from <ref target="http://utilities.84000-translate.org/translations.html">the Translations Tab on the
                Utilities Page</ref>. You will find a link next to the text title that says "Run tests". Note these
            are the same tests that are performed from the "Tests" tab, but this "Run tests" link only performs them
            on the individual text (running tests on all the texts at once uses a lot of the server's resources so this 
            should only be done when testing global updates). It the server will perform a series of tests and display the
            results. If any of the tests fail, click on that entry and it should display the explanation for the error. 
            Most of these you should be able to resolve, but on occasion there may be an error that is difficult to 
            diagnose or sometimes there is a unique anomaly causing the error and the test itself needs to be 
            updated. In either case please notify the lead tech (dominic.latham@84000.co) about any of the test failures
            that can't be resolved.</item>

          <head>List any Outstanding Issues from the Reading Room Revisions Sheet</head>
          <list>
            <item>As you work on the text, make a running list of any problems or issues that you
              cannot fix yourself and make this into a final list of questions and issues. There are
              often a lot of things that come up: some of them should be addressed by the project
              editor, some by a copyeditor and some issues may need be updated in the schema or addressed by the
              technician. This list should be pasted into the <ref target="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rcjhn4k4MixKAyogvAwxkxCVHG7avXn5W0WqhcYdkdw/edit?ts=5b802eba#gid=582485615">Reading Room Revisions spreadsheet, which you can access through this link</ref>.
              There are several sheets within this document. Use the sheet entitled "Texts in
              Markup" and create a new heading for the text you are working on. 
              There are also workflow instructions for how to post issues within
              the Reading Room Revisions sheet itself, at the very top of the "Texts in Markup"
              sheet.</item>
            <item>You may find solutions to these issues as you go, and if you just need your solutions or corrections
            to be checked by one of the editors, then assign the first "status" column with the orange label "check". Otherwise
            assign any new issues as "new".</item>
            <item>From the "Pending on" column you can assign this issue to appropriate party to check:
            <list>
              <item>Any copyeditor issues (spelling, grammar, and style issues) may be assigned to Laura (laura.goetz@84000.co), or as a backup 
                Konchog (konchog@84000.co).</item>
              <item>Any authoritative editorial issues should be assigned to the project editor for that text.</item>
              <item>In general we want to avoid burdening the editorial directors (John and Andreas), with editorial problems that 
              could be resolved by the project editors, but sometimes there may be some important issues that require a directorial decision.
              In such cases, first check with the manager of publications, Mike (mike.engle@84000.co) and he will forward such issues to 
              the directors as is necessary. 
              </item>
              <item>If the text is displaying correctly but the schema needs to be updated (a new element or value, e.g., <att>xml:lang</att> needs to be validated)
                Notify Celso (celso.wilkinson@84000.co).</item>
              <item>Any technical issues to do specifically with the webdisplay/parser should be addressed to Dom (dominic.latham@84000.co) and cc Celso as well.</item>
            </list>
            </item>
            <item>As mentioned in the sheet's workflow instructions, you can assign issues to specific parties by making a comment and typing the "@"
            or "+" character, then selecting them from a drop down list. Or, if you prefer it's fine to just email that person directly. It's best
            to give a suggestion for how the issue may be resolved either from the "comments" column or by email if necessary.</item>
            <item>Occasionally, for issues that everyone may want to discuss, 
              you can also notify or email one of the departments as a whole with the following groups:
            <list>
              <item>84000-markup-editors@googlegroups.com -- address all markup.</item>
              <item>84000-copyeditors@googlegroups.com -- all copyeditors.</item>
              <item>all_editors@84000.co -- addresses all project editors (cc's John and Andreas for overview).</item>
            </list>
            </item>
            <item>As these issues are resolved please clean up your text's section in the review sheet. For anything that 
            is fully resolved you can mark its status as "archive" and move it to the "resolved archive" sheet (or just delete it if it is
            inconsequential). If it seems to be an issue that may come up again and may be useful to reference in the future, 
            you can also add it to the "reference archive" sheet.</item>
            <item>When all the final issues have been resolved or 
              noted for the final review in the Reading Room Revisions sheet, notify the lead markup editor; the markup will be 
              reviewed one more time them and then they will update the status to "2", ("Markup Completed,
              and awaiting final proofing before release").</item>
            <item>If there are any parts of this TEI
              editor's checklist that need to be clarified or updated you can contact Celso to make
              those updates. You can either assign the task to him on the Reading Room Revisions
              Sheet or email him at celso.wilkinson@gmail.com.</item>

          <head>Italics</head>
          <p>In a given text, words or phrases may be italicized for different reasons. The need to
            express both presentation information (that text is italicized) as well as the semantic
            information about why it is italicized must be addressed. That is why instead of simply
            using the <gi>hi</gi> element, for example, the voices below form the markup menu for
            text that needs to be italicized: </p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <gi>distinct</gi> terms, words, or phrases singled out (in any language, but use this
              only when a "foreign" tag is not applicable).</item>
            <item>
              <gi>emph</gi> words or phrases italicized for emphasis or rhetorical effect. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign xml:lang=""</tag> foreign words or phrases in any language.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="term" xml:lang=""</tag> a foreign term or phrase other than a quote
              or title, such as a term or phrase in parentheses following its translation, or a
              foreign term or phrase left untranslated. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>title xml:lang=""</tag> title of a work (in any language). </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign xml:lang="__-Ltn"</tag> Wylie or other type of Roman transliteration
              (excluding European languages, which should not have the "-Ltn" appendage). </item>
            <item>
              <tag>foreign type="quote" xml:lang=""</tag> quotations from other texts. </item>
            <item>
              <tag>mantra</tag> should be used to italicize complete mantras, however this is
              a bit more complex because some parts of mantras maybe translated into English.
              <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.2_div.6">See Appendix B.6 for more about how to markup mantras</ref>.
            </item>
          </list>
          <p>Note that sometimes there may be some overlap between what distinguishes the italics tag used for a “term” vs. a “quote.” In such cases you can use your own discretion, but in general italics used for a “term” are for specific a word or phrase that is left un-translated usually because it is technical, untranslatable, or for some other reason. 
            In contrast the italics used for a “quote” are for italics used for a word or phrase citing a specific instance in a source text either to corroborate the English translation, or to note some difference between two or more sources. 
            Both tags are rendered the same in the end, so this isn’t a critical call to make. There is no need spend time looking up italics to determine whether or not they are found in sources, but just keep this general principle in mind when distinguishing the proper tag for italics.   
          </p>
          <p>Note that Tibetan script and Chinese characters should be given the xml:lang value of
            "bo" and "zh" respectively, while Tibetan, Chinese, and Sanskrit romanized
            transliteration should have the values of "Bo-Ltn," "Zh-Ltn," and "Sa-Ltn" respectively.
            For other languages use the list of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1 codes</ref>
            to find the appropriate xml:lang value. Most often an Asian language will be translated
            into the Roman script and, therefore, the first letter of the ISO 639-1 code should be
            capitalized followed by "-Ltn". Thus a Thai term "th" in Romanized script should be
            coded "Th-Ltn." If the term is a European language or the native script of that language
            is used, then use the two letter code as usual, e.g., "fr" (French), "la" (Latin),
            etc.</p>
          <p>For the most part, these tags should be added during the copy editing phase in the
            84000 Template.docx. In this phase they will be added as styles in MS Word, but will be
            transformed into the appropriate tag by our scripts. However, as we can't add a style
            for every language in the template, the markup editor will need look up and edit the
            tags for any uncommon languages, which will be marked through the script as
            xml:lang="Input Language." The markup editor should also keep an eye out for errors, or
            italicized text that was missed. However, the script should render all unmarked italics
            with a "&lt;fix&gt;" tag, which will be highlighted as an error by the schema.</p>

                        <head>Types of Divisions</head>
          <p>Div elements are used to mark different sections within a text. This is of particular
            importance as the <gi>head</gi> tag can only follow directly after a "div" marker or
            another <gi>head</gi> tag. The main sections of the text are marked as follows:</p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="summary"</tag> Wraps the Summary section.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="acknowledgement"</tag> Wraps the Acknowledgement section.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="prologue"</tag> Wraps the Prologue (if there is one).</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="preface"</tag> Wraps the Preface (if there is one).</item>

            <item>

              displaying abbreviations.</item>

              <tag>div type="listBibl"</tag> Contains a group of bibl elements, wraps the
              bibliography.</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="appendix"</tag> To wrap the appendix of a text, e.g. a Sanskrit
              Appendix (if there is one).</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="colophon"</tag> Wraps the colophon. (Note, the schema only allows this nested as a second level div after all second level "sections" and/or "chapters")</item>
            <!--<item>
              <tag>div type="epilogue"</tag> Wraps the epilogue, if there is one. (Note, the schema only allows this nested as a second level div after all second level "sections" and/or "chapters")</item>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="dedication"</tag> Wraps the dedication, if there is one. (Note, the schema only allows this nested as a second level div after all second level "sections" and/or "chapters")</item>-->
          </list>
          <p>Within those major document units or divisions, there are other sub units, especially
            chapters or their equivalent. Both chapter and section refer to the same hierarchical
            level in the XML. Chapters are the type value used in the body of the text when they
            have been specified as chapters by the translator. Section is used for equivalent level
            sectioning that has not been called a chapter. Examples for the latter are sectioned
            bibliographies, where the whole of the bibliography has multiple sections organized by
            source type. In that case <tag>div type="section"</tag> is used instead of <tag>div
              type="chapter"</tag>. From a structural point of view, however, they are the same.</p>
          <list>
            <item>
              <tag>div type="chapter"</tag> Wraps a chapter that is part of the translation.</item>
            <item>

            <head>Changing the Chapter Numbers</head>
            <p>Occasionally, for whatever reason the chapter numbers may need to be altered. <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">For example in Toh 543</ref>, many chapters 
            are skipped since a Sanskrit source was matched to the chapters in the Kangyur. The number needs to be displayed as such in the header but also needs to have the proper number prefixed in the table of contents and all the milestones contained
            within the chapter, all of which will be diverging from the number that is automatically generated by the parser. This can be done by adding a single @prefix attribute to the appropriate chapter's <gi>div</gi> element. e.g.:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <div type="chapter" prefix="24">
                <!--...-->
              </div>
            </egXML>
              So <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/UT22084-088-038.html">this chapter and all its milestones will now display the "24" prefix in the reading room</ref> even though it isn't the 24th "chapter" division in the TEI file.

        <div>
          <head>Outlines and Lists</head>
          <p>Sometimes the introduction of a text will provide an outline, particularly in the case
            of a longer or more complicated text. Within the TEI XML these outlines should be
            constructed using the <gi>list</gi> and <gi>item</gi> elements. For a complex outline
            with many levels of subsections, the outline itself should be contained in a list, and
            each section should be contained in an <gi>item</gi> within that list. Then, for each

                      the absence of fixation with respect to all phenomena, all meditative
                      experiences, all causal attributes acquired by bodhisattvas, all fruitional

                      all things and the finality of existence, these are all attributes with
                      respect to which a great bodhisattva being should cultivate detachment.
                      Bodhisattvas do perceive such phenomena distinctly, but only on the relative
                      level; in an ultimate sense they consider them to be illusory, in the manner
                      of a dream and so forth. </p>

          <p>Cross references in the text that refer to milestones will be added using a

            hashmark ("#") followed by the xml:id value of the milestone that is to be linked. For
            example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> See <ptr target="#UT22084-060-005-1"/><!--2.3-->. </egXML> The milestone number as it appears
            on the webpage may be listed as a comment afterwards, but the parser will automatically
            show the milestone number in the web display. This way even if the milestones shift
            around it will still display and link to the correct milestone on the web page. </p>
              <p>
                One important point about adding references to the introduction. When you mark up introductions 
                with internal <gi>ptr</gi> references to the translation, even if the translator has used source-text 
                folio references (e.g F.108.a) for the cross-reference, it would be helpful if you could replace them by links to the relevant milestone in the translation. 
                For most readers that will make much more sense. Of course the translators have no choice, because at the time they put such cross-references in there are no milestones.</p>
                  <p>If you can’t identify exactly the passage and its milestone, you can of course leave it as the folio reference, 
                  and John or someone will make the change during final editing. And, of course, if the reference is really all (and only) 
                  about a Tibetan passage in the source text, and the translation is irrelevant, a folio reference makes more sense.

            <list>
              <item>Often texts will cite Dunhuang texts. These texts are referenced using the IDP's abbreviations, e.g."IOL Tib J 149", "IOL Tib J 705", etc... The page
                for the specific text can be found by <ref target="http://idp.bl.uk/">entering the abbreviation directly into the IDP's search bar here</ref> (on the left side where
                  it says "Search the IDP Database"). You should check that the page exists and if it is publicly available. However there is an issue with linking
                directly with this page. If you open the page it will use an URL with an id number in it such as <code>http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_scroll_h.a4d?uid=1846009887;bst=1;recnum=5001;index=1;img=1</code>
              It seems the part of the URL "uid" shifts so this link will become dead. Instead this alternative URL should be used:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=[ENTER THE IDP ABBREVIATIION HERE];img=1
              </egXML>
                So for example if you want to link to "IOL Tib J 149", then use this URL <code>http://idp.bl.uk/database/oo_loader.a4d?pm=IOL Tib J 149;img=1</code>.
                This will ensure the link remains stable. For an example, see <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh196.html#link-to-UT22084-061-016-78">this note, n.35 from TOH 196</ref>.

             <p> When another Kangyur/Tengyur text is referenced that has not yet been published, since we don't have a URL for that text,
              a coded comment should be added that follows a format that is searchable later. This code is as follows:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><!--Reference Toh ####--></egXML>
              The code must follow this exact format up to the fourth digit of the Toh number. However after this fourth digit, any further information
              that will help the markup editor find the proper section to be linked may be added, such as the folio number, <code>&lt;!--Reference Toh #### F.11.a--&gt;</code>
              or chapter number for a Vinaya text, <code>&lt;!--Reference Toh #### F.11.a--&gt;</code> and so forth.</p>
              <p>These references will then be searched and updated according to the markup editor's guidelines <ref target="84000_ODD.html#index.xml-back.1_div.1_div.11">(Appendix A.11)</ref> 
                whenever the markup for a text is completed.</p>
              <p>In the 84000 translator guidelines, we are encouraging translators to mark cross references with their own tags following this format. However,
              they may neglect doing this and so the copy editors are also encouraged to add these and the markup editors
              may add them as well.</p>
              <p>We don't need to be obsessive about these comments marking up every possible nuance of a reference to another text,
                but we should think from the perspective of the reader and when a URL link would be convenient or helpful
                it should be added particularly inside the introduction, notes, glossary, or bibliography.</p>

          <p>Note, if there is an ampersand "&amp;" in the url address this will be read incorrectly
            in the TEI. The ampersand character itself should be replaced by the ampersand character
            code "&amp;amp;". The link should now work properly.</p>

          <head>Tables</head>
          <p>Occasionally translators may present a table in their translation. Tables can be used anywhere in the text
          or even contained within an endnote. The XSL script should be equipped to convert tables from the DOCX document
          to the TEI XML; however, attributes need to be applied to the <gi>table</gi>s, <gi>row</gi>s, and <gi>cell</gi>s 
          manually (see for example the <att>role</att>="label" attributes found in the <gi>row</gi>s in the XML sample below).
          Also each table should be checked against the original DOCX to assure that there weren't any errors 
          in the conversion process. So far there have note been many tables in 84000 publications but here is one example
          from <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh361.html#link-to-UT22084-077-002-623">TOH 361</ref>:

                    </p>
          <p>As you can see a <gi>table</gi> contains an optional heading and a series of <gi>row</gi>s.
            Each <gi>row</gi> in turn contains a series of <gi>cells</gi> representing the way they are to 
            be rendered from left to right. Add the very bottom of the table after the final <gi>row</gi>, 
            any <gi>note</gi>s may be placed here regarding the table itself. In the example above there are
            three such <gi>note</gi>s marked by asterisks. These are not endnotes, as they do not
            have the <att>place</att>="end" attribute, so they will be rendered at the bottom of the table rather
            than becoming additional endnotes. Optionally, paragraphs <gi>p</gi> may be placed at the bottom of the table
            in a similar manner, still within the <gi>table</gi> but after the final <gi>row</gi>.</p>
          <p>Currently there is no need to distinguish how the table should be rendered,
            but as this becomes necessary, any rendition information should be supplied using the global <att>rend</att> 
            attribute, at the table, row, or cell level as appropriate. Currently no <att>type</att> is
            being used, but this may be added to the schema and documentation when it becomes necessary.
            Cells and rows should be assigned <att>role</att>="label" if they are considered to be the label or heading
            in which the subsequent <gi>cell</gi>s are considered to be data relevant to that label. If a <gi>row</gi>
            contains the <att>role</att>="label" attribute, then all of its child <gi>cell</gi>s will be considered
            to be "label"s as well. These labels will be rendered in bold type in the HTML web display.</p>
          <p>Note, when marking up <gi>table</gi>s the markup editor should check that the table renders properly
            in the reading room's web display. In addition, the table needs to be checked in the ebook display as well.
            This can be done by adding the code: <code>?viewmode=epub</code> to the very end of the url address on the
            utilities page. In truth, the tables are not compatible with the ebook format, so the parser will instead display 
            them as a bulleted list. The information in this list should be presented in a complete and eloquently readable way,
            otherwise the parser should be updated.</p>

          <head>Mantras</head>
          <label rend="bold">Documenting all mantras with <gi>mantra</gi> tags.</label>
          <p>
            The tags used for mantras are a bit complicated because our final markup as it is found in the 
            final XML needs to document all of the strings of mantra, but not all the mantra’s text will necessarily
            be italicized, as in some cases mantras will be translated into English with leftover fragments of foreign
            italicized terms in the form of seed syllables or untranslatable words (Hung! Phet! etc...). Therefore, as a general
            rule all mantras, whether in the main text or notes should be marked by a <gi>mantra</gi> tag, however,
            the italics will be determined by the parser according to the <att>xml:lang</att> attributes in the mantra
            element: if the value is "en" or "mixed" the mantra won't be italicized, but with any other language
            value all the text within the <gi>mantra</gi> tag will be italicized. In the case of a mixed translated English/Sanskrit
            mantra, the Sanskrit fragments within the parent <gi>mantra</gi> need to be additionally marked up with &lt;foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"&gt;
            elements in order to render the italics. See examples below in "a. General Scenarios."         
          </p>
          <label rend="bold">Tagging mantras with styles in MS Word</label>
          <p>
            To help stream line this process the mantras will be partially marked up by styles converted from the copyeditor template in MS Word, however
            because MS Word can't layer multiple character styles, we can't tag the foreign fragments and the mantras at the same
            time. To resolve this conundrum, we have come up with the following solution: If the mantra is full and complete in 
            one language, it can be tagged with the appropriate style in the template, but if the mantra is mixed, then just the 
            italicized fragments should be tagged with a "Fragment-in-MixedMantra" style. This will in turn create a <gi>foreign</gi>
            element that contains a <att>type</att>="FragmentinMixedMantra" attribute. Then since "FragmentinMixedMantra" is not a valid type 
            value in our schema it will show up as an error, which will signal you to
            wrap the whole mantra in a &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt; tag. Finally after these mixed mantras have been wrapped in
            &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt; tags from their beginning to end, all of the type="FragmentinMixedMantra" attributes can be 
            removed with the refactoring tool: Within the Tools --&gt; XML Refactoring tool, use the "Delete Attribute" opperation, 
            then for element enter in: <code>mantra/foreign[@type="FragmentinMixedMantra"]</code> and for the attribute enter in: <code>type</code>
            This will insure that only the <att>type</att> attributes will be removed that have the value "FragmentinMixedMantra"
            and it will also only remove those of <gi>foreign</gi> elements within <gi>mantra</gi>s, this way it will ensure that all
            of them have first been properly wrapped in &lt;mantra xml:lang="mixed"&gt; elements. 
          </p>
          <label rend="bold">Placing some mantras in indented blocks.</label>
          <p>
            In terms of style, whenever there is a formally declared mantra, it will often be placed into an indented block
            paragraph. This is not configured by the <gi>mantra</gi> tag, but rather by adding a <att>rend</att>="mantra" attribute to the parent <gi>p</gi> or <gi>lg</gi>
            element which is to be rendered as an indented block by the parser. However, this will not always the case,
            depending on the length, frequency, and context of the mantra, the translator and/or copy editors may wish to 
            place the mantras in regular paragraphs or verses. This is a stylistic choice that will vary from case to case.
            All of the <att>rend</att>="mantra" attributes will be created by the script wherever the "Mantra-Block" or "Mantra-Block-Verse"
            paragraph style is used within the copyeditor's template. So in general, this will be dealt with in the copyediting 
            phase and markup editors will not need to apply these <att>rend</att> attributes, but you should be aware how this markup works.
          </p>
          <label rend="bold">Dhāraṇis and seed syllables.</label>
          <p>Seed syllables that are mentioned in the text for the purposes of visualization or explanation should also 
          be marked up as <gi>mantra</gi>s, but they need to be distinguished with the <att>type</att>="syllable" attribute
          (see example below a.iv).</p>
          <p>
            For all dhāraṇis, that is if a string or phrase is declared to be a dhāraṇi by either the text itself or the 
            translator, then these should be tagged in the same way, but a <att>type</att>="dharani" attribute should be 
            added to the <gi>mantra</gi> element. Currently "dhāraṇi" styles have not been added to the template, instead
            copy editors are informed to make a comment whenever dharanis are present. The markup editor need to add the
            appropriate <att>type</att>="dharani" so be sure to keep an eye out for this while going through the mantras
            in the XML. There are also some mantras self described as "vidyā", "vidyāmantra", "secret mantra", etc. in some texts (see Toh 270, 543) which can be tagged in the same way.

              <p>note. In general, with English/mixed mantras we should include the final period or exclamation mark within the tag, as the mantra is usually a complete sentence and sometimes spans more than one sentences so it makes sense to include them for consistency. However, if the mantra is entirely in Sanskrit, then this punctuation should be excluded if possible. Quotations at the boundaries of the mantra should be excluded from the tag wherever possible.</p>

          <p>Typically, the homage preceding just before a mantra should not be included in the mantra tag nor
            the indented paragraph. This can sometimes be confusing since separate homages sometimes appear as part
            of the mantra proper. All of this should be worked out earlier in the workflow by the editors and 
            copy editors, but in case you need to confirm this, here are some guidelines concerning the mantras
            and their homages given by Wiesiek Mical:</p>
          <p>Most of the time there is no ambiguity.  There are three things to look for when deciding whether the 
            homage is part of the mantra or not, each of the three usually sufficient on its own to decide:</p>
          <list>
            <item>1) The presence of tadyathā. If it is there, then the homage that precedes it is not part of the mantra, 
              as in this mantra of Mahāśvetā (all examples quoted below are from the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa):

            </item>
            <item>2) But the tadyathā is not always there, as in this heart mantra of Mañjuśrī:
              <lb/>
              <hi rend="bold">Sanskrit Source</hi>
              <lb/>

              <lb/>
              “Homage be to all the buddhas!
              <lb/>
              &lt;mantra&gt;Oṁ maṁ!&lt;/mantra&gt;
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <p tid="50"> “Homage to all the buddhas! </p>
                <p rend="mantra" tid="51">“<mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Oṁ maṁ</mantra>!”</p>
              </egXML>
              <p>
                                <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh52.html#UT22084-088-038-61">See in Reading Room</ref>
                            </p>
              It is almost a rule (exceptions are few) that the homage begins with namaḥ, and the mantra that follows it begins with oṁ, so the oṁ will usually marks the beginning of the mantra.
            </item>
            <item>3) The third criterion to go by is that the homage addresses the buddhas (or the buddhas and bodhisattvas) in general, whereas the mantra addresses the deity—both examples given above make this clear, even though, in the second, Mañjuśrī is not addressed by name.
              <lb/>
              The above three criteria may be used to decide that the homage is not part of the mantra. So how to know when the homage is part of the mantra?
              <lb/>
              The main criterion is that the homage in such cases will typically begin with oṁ and address specifically the deity of the mantra (not the buddhas in general). This is illustrated by the example quoted by Celso—Oṁ, homage to Cakravartin, the invincible uṣṇīṣa of the tathāgatas, invisible at the top of their head, (oṁ namo • apratihata­tathāgatoṣṇīṣāya • anavalokita­mūrdhni cakra­varti)—where the homage addresses the uṣṇīṣa king Cakravartin, i.e. the deity that this mantra is invoking. The homage is therefore part of the mantra.
              <lb/>
              Even if the oṁ is missing (due to textual corruptions?), if the homage specifically addresses the deity, it still should be treated as part of the mantra:
              <lb/>
              <hi rend="bold">Sanskrit Source</hi>
              <lb/>

              <lb/>
              &lt;mantra&gt;Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Come, come, o blessed Dharma lord! Take this welcome-offering… &lt;/mantra&gt;

                  O blessed Dharma lord! Take this welcome offering of water, fragrances,

              </egXML>

                            </p>
              Also, there are innumerable mantras that consist entirely of homage. In these cases, the presence or absence of oṁ is often the only differentiator between a mantra and just homage. For example, oṁ namaḥ śivāya is a mantra, and namaḥ śivāya on its own would by just homage.

          <head>Abbreviations Section</head>
          <p>As for when Kangyur abbreviations should be used here is a note from John:</p>
          <p>I see this as needing an adapted approach, depending on the number and kind of notes, in several steps:</p>
          <list>
            <item>1) I think in texts where there aren’t many notes about variants in different Kangyurs — let’s say a maximum of about 10 notes — it's probably easier for our readers if we simply spell out “Degé Kangyur” or “Stok Palace Kangyur” each time.</item>
            <item>2) If there are more notes than that, but they almost all refer to one Kangyur, we could say “Degé Kangyur” the first time and just “Degé” in subsequent mentions, and an abbreviations list is unnecessary.</item>
            <item> 3) If there are quite a lot of notes and they refer to several different Kangyurs, or the Chinese, Sanskrit versions, etc., then we should definitely have an abbreviations list and use the sigla alone in all such notes.
            </item>        
          </list>
          <p>This should be covered by the editors, but they may not have created an abbreviations section. If there are a lot for sigla 
            used in the notes (situation 3 above), but there is not abbreviations section, then please create one modeled on other texts.</p>
          <p>When the abbreviations for alternative Kangyur editions are used, you should <ref target="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sigla/">follow the Vienna system</ref>.</p>
          <p>Sigla with supscript letters should use the &lt;hi rend="subscript"&gt; tag, using the matching case used in the official sigla,
          e.g., <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">K<hi rend="subscript">Y</hi>

          <list>
            <item>If it is a Sanskrit Appendix the initial heading should be labeled "Sanskrit Text" and then any sub headings may be labeled appropriately as chapters, sections, etc.</item>
            <item>To distinguish between the numbers in the appendix's chapter headers from those in the main translation add an "-A" to each number, e.g.,
              "Chapter A1", "Chapter A2"...</item>
            <item>Often the translator will have typed untagged milestones into the Sanskrit appendices. If possible we would like to arrange our own
            <att>milestones</att> so that the milestone index generated in the reading room by the parser match up with these, and then the original 
              milestones from the word doc may be commented out. For example <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh437.html#UT22084-081-006-274">see Toh 437</ref>, and if you look in the original TEI you will see the orginal 
              milestones in the appendix have been commented out. However, there are some cases when this will not be possible because some complexity in the correlation. This was the case in <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh543.html#appendix">Toh 543</ref>
            where the text was translated from a Sanskrit manuscript in which chapters omitted in the Tibetan were skipped. In this case the final 
            milestones were left in as is, and an explanation was added in the appendix's prologue.</item>
            <item>Note, that often there will be entries in the glossary that may be Sanskrit names or terms that also appear in the Sanskrit appendix.
            However since these won't be linked consistently due to Sanskrit's complex spelling declinations, we generally want to avoid linking the Sanskrit body of the appendices all
            together. This can be done by adding an @rend="ignoreGlossary" attribute to either the <gi>p</gi> or <gi>div</gi> elements you would like to be blocked. 
            Ostensibly there will be terms in the English prologue/introduction to the appendix that we would won't to link, so these @rend attributes can 
            be applied and adjusted according to the need.</item>

        <head>Some Notes About How the Glossary Works</head>
        <p>Note, also see the <ref target="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MMr8x-kACoMB_O6ySU0IagoyFm6gTEGIJqgYi2Dx0rI/edit#bookmark=id.6skneq5uuzjw">Translator Guidelines V.G. Glossary</ref>. There is a definitive explanation for translators on how to create their glossaries 
          and these principles should be carried forward in to markup.</p>
        <label rend="bold">How Reader Handles Plurals:</label>
        <p>A term will be matched if it is followed by s, es, 's, or s' and then a non-word
          character, e.g. Maitreya, Maitreya's, Maitreyas. (Unfortunately, the general marker for
          non-word characters is not Sanskrit-aware. It handles Sanskrit diacritic characters as
          non-word characters. While we have handled most of the related issues in this case it can
          result in a few mistakes, e.g. Maitreyasāyana).</p>
        <label rend="bold">Capitalization</label>
        <p>The glossary is not case-sensitive and will link to names and terms regardless of capitalization. 
        However, note that as a standard within the TEI proper names should be capitalized in the English and
        Sanskrit field but NOT in the Tibetan Wylie field. Although the parser will display all the English and Sanskrit entries in
        the Reading Room itself as capitalized regardless of the text found in the TEI.</p>
        <label rend="bold">Use of the <gi>term</gi> Tag to Mark the Same Word Used in Different
          Ways:</label>
        <p>Sometimes we will only want certain instances of a string of text to be marked as a
          glossary term. For example, perhaps we want the term "appropriate" to be linked to this
          term when it is used as verb but not when it used as an adjective.  
          The translator guidelines [G4] instructs translators to flag instances

          are also instructed to specify glossary entries as verbs (vb), nouns (n), or adjectives (adj)
          in cases where the glossary entry is only intended to link to one form of the word and not others,
          for example "play" or "appropriate" (These should not be left in the text but replaced with the markup
          described in the following section). However, many of these may be missed and so all the linked terms
          should be checked in markup. 
          Note, that we are no longer using zero-width-non-joiners to resolve this issue. Instead, we now use the "mode"

        <p>In the glossary, <gi>gloss</gi> nodes can be given the attributes mode="match|marked."
          Match mode will highlight any matches in the text except where they have been marked up
          with <tag>term type="ignore"</tag>, e.g.: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">parse this <term type="ignore">but not this</term>
          </egXML> Marked mode will only match terms that have been marked up with <gi>term</gi>

        <!--Currently we are not using priorities-->
        <!--<label>Use of priorities</label>
          <p>Some glossary terms overlap. If a word is found in more than one glossary item then the database will set a priority attribute on the related <gloss> items. Precedence is given to glossary items with a higher priority. By default the priority is derived from the number of words in the phrase. This can be manually overridden by setting the attribute as you wish and saving it. In the following example instances of the term "inconceivable liberation" will be given precedence over "inconceivable" when the text is glossarised.
            <gloss priority="1">
              <term>inconceivable</term>
            </gloss>
            <gloss priority="2">
              <term>inconceivable liberation</term>

        <label rend="bold">How Tibetan Is Created from Wylie:</label>
        <p>Where a glossary item has a Wylie term but no Tibetan the database will auto-generate the
          Tibetan. To re-create a Tibetan term simply remove the node, save, and refresh. The Wylie
          string will also have a trailing space enforced. These will produce the respective
          syllable separators in the Tibetan. Double underscores in Wylie will be replaced with a
          single space when output to the reader. </p>
        <p>If later you make a correction to a Tibetan entry, be sure to delete the term with Tibetan Unicode 
          (the one with xml:lang="bo") this will trigger the database to auto-generate a new one from 
          the corrected Wylie entry, but if you leave it as is the error will remain in the Tibetan Unicode.</p>

        <p>In some cases a single <gi>gloss</gi> entry may have multiple forms for spelling the
          Tibetan, the Sanskrit, or both. In this case each spelling of the term can be listed
          separately in its own <gi>term</gi> element. However, Tibetan should be listed first,
          followed by the Sanskrit, as in the following example for the term "karnikara" (note that
          a Tibetan "bo" term is auto-generated after each instance of Tibetan Wylie "Bo-Ltn"):</p>

                </p>
        <p>Alternatives may be added for any related terms that should be linked to the entry such as:
        <list>
          <item>When a plural "-s" appears in the middle of the string in certain cases and is not linking (as in the XML example above), or not linking because the
          plural has an irregular spelling, e.g. "phenomena" and "phenomenon"; "birth-story" and "birth-stories"; etc...</item>
          <item>Alternate nominal or verbal uses of the same term: appropriate, appropriated, appropriation.</item>
          <item>Extended names such as "Mañjuśrī" and "Mañjuśrī the crown prince". In this last case only if the simple name is clearly represented in the extended one, otherwise
            a second <gi>gloss</gi> should be added referring to the primary one, e.g.: The Great Compassionate One -- See Avalokiteśvara.</item>
       </list>
        </p>
        <p>However, alternatives should not be used for two semantically different English words, even if they are translated from the same Tibetan term and have similar meaning.
          For example if "offering" and "worship" are both used for "mchod pa / pūjā". They should be given two different glossary entries.</p>
        <p>The 84000 translator's guidelines (G4) states this clearly:</p> 
          <p>If the same Tibetan or Sanskrit word was translated in more than one way, include an entry for each, and place 
          in the definition a reference to the other rendering, e.g. for the entry “Offering” (mchod pa / pūjā): “Also 
          translated here as ‘worship,’ ” (and vice versa for the entry “Worship”).</p>
        <p>There are two reasons for this. (1) We don't want readers unfamiliar with Tibetan and Sanskrit clicking on a term like "worship" and having it link to "offering," and
        (2) Some readers may be reading the text in a PDF format or even someday in print and will need to look up terms alphabetically as the hyperlinks won't be available.</p>
        <p>Some of these alternatives may have been entered improperly and will need to be separated into separate entries. This
        should be handled by copy editors, but in some cases it may be missed and markup editors will be more capable of spotting inconsistencies or issues in the glossary since
        they will be able to actually click on the links and check them in the Reading Room. </p>
        <p>There has been some further discussion regarding whether alternatives should be used when the English words for a glossary entry are used in  
          a different word order. So in the example above for "door of the dharma" one might ask, should this itself be used as an alternative linking to the entry for 
          "dharma-door" or should it be in a separate entry? In this case it isn't such an issue that the reader would click on "door of the Dharma" and see the 
          entry for "Dharma-door" but it is an issue for anyone reading the PDF. However it is quite sensible that the reader would simply search for the term under "dharma"
          if they did not find it in "door". If there are a just a few instances of these it makes sense to create separate entries, but if the amount 
          of entries with alternate word order is becoming extensive then this could be an issue because it will muddy up the glossary, be difficult for reader to find all the instances of a term from 
          the "passages contain this term" field, and also it could muddy up the cumulative glossary. When there are a lot of such alternatives it may be better to 
         set such phrases as "door of the dharma" as an alternative provided that it would be sensible from the perspective of the reader and there aren't semantically
        distinct words (e.g., you wouldn't want to add "gateway of the dharma" as an alternative). If there are a lot of such instances, you should also check with the editors
        about changing the translation to be more consistent (make notes about such instances in the Reading Room Worksheet). This should be taken on a case by case basis and always thought of from the
        readers perspective.</p>
        <label rend="bold">Further Explanation on the Mode Attribute:</label>
        <p>The mode attribute is not required, but when present it can either be "match" or
          "marked." "Match" is the default (where this attribute is not specified). "Match" will
          behave in the normal way: the text is scanned for glossary matches and highlighted
          accordingly.</p>
        <p>"Marked," on the other hand, will only consider text strings that have been marked up
          with <gi>term</gi>. An example for "appropriate" is below: </p>

        <list>
          <item>Sometimes a term will appear in its own definition. In this case it looks a bit
            silly for the term to link to itself, so it would be best to mark it with <tag>term
              type="ignore"</tag>.</item>
          <item>If there are references in the definition to a term, such as "see also...", they can
            be placed into a second <tag>term type="definition"</tag> line, to create some visual
            lightness in the final webdisplay.</item>
          <item>If a word is not linking in the webdisplay, here are some common causes for
            instances not being detected by the parser: <list>
              <item>Plurals in the middle of strings of words (where the "s" doesn't come at the
                end).</item>
              <item>An extra space at the end of the term in the glossary.</item>
              <item>Sanskrit soft-hypens in the term not matching with the glossary entry.</item>
            </list>
          </item>
          <item>Occasionally you will see a word in the text that is similar to a glossary term but
            isn't linked because it takes as different form. For instance, "appropriate" is in the
            glossary, but you see "appropriation" in the text. If you see instances like this you
            can add an <tag>term type="alternative"</tag> to that <gi>gloss</gi> item, but be sure
            that you are not then linking to other unwanted instances as well.</item>

        <head>Guidelines for Entering Milestones into the TEI Document</head>
        <p>Milestones are applied to the document with the “<tag>milestone unit="chunk"/</tag>” tag.
          Because the 84000 reading room does not have page numbers, milestones are particularly
          important for referencing sections or paragraphs in the text.</p>
        <p>Milestones should be applied to the text at places where there is a logical/thematic
          division in the text. Sometimes, milestones can be placed at the beginning of each paragraph
          of prose. In cases where paragraphs are very short (only one or two sentences) milestones
          can be placed one for every two or more paragraphs depending on the context, or a
          particularly short paragraph can share the milestone with that of a larger previous or
          later paragraph that shares the same “theme.”</p>
        <p>To a large degree the editor should use their own judgment: If the milestones are too
          frequent, then it will become distracting to the reader on the page. If they are too far
          apart, it will be difficult to cite particular passages of the text. It is helpful to
          check the display in the reading room after applying milestones to make sure they appear
          in a convenient way and to visually check there is general consistency throughout the text.</p>
        <p>Often there will be very short paragraphs used during sections of dialogue. A logical way
          to organize these sections is to allow one question and answer to be given a single
          milestone. For example, the following passage could be given one milestone: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <milestone unit="chunk"/>
          <p>The Lord then said to the venerable Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, did you see that universe
            Abhirati, and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya?”</p>
          <p>Śāriputra replied, “I saw it, Lord! May all living beings come to live in a buddhafield
            as splendid as that! May all living beings come to have miraculous powers just like
            those of the noble Licchavi Vimalakīrti!</p>
        </egXML>

                </p>
        <p>If either the question or the answer are very short paragraphs (one or two sentences),
          then they could be appended to the milestone along with their respective question and
          answer. However, if both the question and answer are long paragraphs in themselves, they
          should each be given their own milestone. Of course, there will always be unique
          situations such as questions being answered with another question and so forth. The editor
          should in general use their own discretion to decide what frequency of milestones would be
          the most useful and least distracting to the reader. They should to try to be consistent
          with their usage. </p>
        <p>When entering milestones for lines of verse, the editor should apply milestones in a
          consistent manner, which will typically be one milestone marker between every line group
          element <gi>lg</gi>. Usually this will be a verse of four lines in English. </p>
        <p>For example, see how milestones are applied to the following verses from The Teachings of
          Vimalakīrti: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <p>One exception to this may occur when a set of verses are introduced by a very short line, 
          such as “The Blessed One said:” In this case use your judgment to place a milestone either before 
          this short line and not the verse, or vice-versa, depending on the spatial and thematic context 
          you are working in:</p>

                </p>
        <p>In another case the editor may encounter short sentences used in a debate-like
          dialogue. For example, in this following dialogue found in The Teachings of Vimalakīrti: </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

          <p>Mañjuśrī: What is the great compassion of a bodhisattva ?</p>

          <p>Mañjuśrī: What is the great joy of the bodhisattva?</p>
          <p>Vimalakīrti: It is to be joyful and without regret in giving.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk"/>
          <p>Mañjuśrī: What is the equanimity of the bodhisattva? </p>
          <p>Vimalakīrti: It is what benefits both self and others.</p>
          <p>Mañjuśrī: To what should one resort when terrified by fear of life?</p>
          <p>Vimalakīrti: Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should resort to
            the magnanimity of the Buddha.</p>

        <p>Here the editor might place a milestone for each item in the list depending on the length
          of each paragraph. It might also be appropriate to place the milestones according to
          logical groupings in the list, for example place one milestone for the four immeasurables,
          one milestone for the six paramitas, etc. Finally, if the list becomes overburdened by
          milestones, the editor can add the milestones for every two or four items in the list. In
          this case it might be worthwhile to check how many items there are in the list then seek a
          reasonable way to divide it up evenly. </p>
        <p>If the editor is not sure about the frequency for applying milestones, he or she can
          refer to some of the other texts in the reader and see how frequently the milestones are
          used in other texts. For now, <ref target="http://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh131.html">Toh 131 is a good example.</ref>
                </p>
        <p>While editing in oXygen, it can be easier to edit milestones while in "author mode" (go
          to "Author" in the menu bar and click on "Switch to Author Mode." This will show the
          layout of the text more clearly and you can remove the milestones by double clicking on
          them and hitting delete.) This is a useful way to quickly edit milestones, but should not 
          be a substitute for checking visually in the Reading Room.</p>
        <p>There are a few places where we <hi rend="italic">always</hi> want to have a milestone: (1) trailers (both at the 
          end of chapters and any concluding trailer to the entire text); (2) the opening homage and 
          the following paragraph; and (3) in ancillary sections (summary, acknowledgement, colophon, etc.). </p>

        <head>Guidelines for Entering Soft Hyphens to Sanskrit</head>
        <p>Note that only editors with a basic understanding of the spelling and sandhi rules of
          Sanskrit should proceed with this step. You don't need to be an expert in Sanskrit, as
          most words can be looked up in online references, however, for this step editors will need
          to have a clear grasp on how the sandhi rules in Sanskrit work. If not please request that
          another editor with this skill to complete this task.</p>
        <list>
          <item>Look for long Sanskrit chains, and add optional soft-hyphens at points where there
            are chains that are 15+ characters long. Optional soft-hyphens are created with the
            character code: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">&amp;#173;</egXML>Note
            that after you save the XML these will look like regular hyphens, but if you move the
            blinking cursor to the space just before the hyphen you will notice there is a different
            character code displayed at the bottom of the oXygen screen.</item>
          <item>The long Sanskrit chains can be found easily by going to Window &gt; Show View &gt;
            XPath/XQuery Builder, then in the XPath/XQuery Builder window type the following code
            and press the red play button:<code>//*[string-length(string()) &gt; 14 and @xml:lang
              ='Sa-Ltn']</code> You can save this query for later by clicking on the star and
            choosing "add to favourites."</item>
          <item>Note that texts that have Sanskrit appendixes will not be checked by the code above
          because these sections aren't marked with an @xml:lang attribute. Generally, the Sanskrit appendixes
          such as the one in <ref target="https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/toh437.html#appendix">Toh 437</ref>
          does not need soft hyphens because it is not anticipated that they will be read on small
          devices. However, occasionally there may be extremely long strings in the appendices that will 
          fill the screen even on a regular web browser. For the appendices our current limit is any strings 
          longer than 40 continuous characters without as space. To search the appendices, press
          CTRL/SHIFT/H to "search in files" then check the "regular expression" box, in the scope select "All open files", and
          in "Restrict to XPath:" enter the code: <code>//text()</code>. Finally, in the search field enter the
          following regex code: <code>(^|\s|-­)[^\s-­]{40,}($|\s|-­)</code>. This should give you a list of all the 40+ 
          strings while ignoring tags, spaces, or hyphens.</item>
          <item>Be careful when adding the soft hyphens as they should only be placed at certain
            points in the words where they do not interfere with the Sanskrit rules of sandhi. When
            adding the soft hyphens please follow the following guidelines:</item>
          <item>
            <label>Guidelines for Adding Soft-Hyphens to Sanskrit:</label>
            <list>
              <item>
                <p>1. As we are not using full justification anyway, (a) most Sanskrit words don’t
                  need hyphenation unless they are longer than 5 or 6 syllables, but (b) may be
                  necessary for shorter words especially in text titles on the title page. I
                  therefore tend to place soft hyphens in all of the text titles, in verse passages,
                  in the bibliography entries, and in notes and glossary entries (which require
                  shorter lines in general).</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <p>2. Place a soft hyphen (a) only between the words of a compound; (b) even then
                  only when there are no changes brought about by sandhi (because putting a hyphen
                  would logically mean undoing the sandhi, and the hyphens we’re talking about may
                  or may not appear); and (c) avoiding confusing remnants.</p>
                <p>A couple of examples:</p>
                <p>Ratnagotravibhāgottaratantraśāstra would be
                  Ratna-gotra-vibhāgottara-tantra-śāstra. If we divided the 5-syllable sequence in
                  the middle, that would have to undo the sandhi and become -vibhāga-uttara-, which
                  only works in the presence of a hard hyphen. Theoretically we could put a hyphen
                  at vi-bhāga, but that would risk leaving us with -gotravi-, which would be
                  potentially confusing to read.</p>
                <p>The maximum we could hyphenate antānantaḍṛṣṭivāsanābhisaṃdhisamuccedaka would be
                  antānanta-ḍṛṣṭi-vāsanābhi-saṃdhi-sam-ucchedaka, because antānanta and
                  vāsanābhi-saṃdhi would become anta-ananta and vāsana-abhi-saṃdhi. In a case like
                  that, I would also prefer to avoid ending up with
                  antānantaḍṛṣṭivāsanābhi-saṃdhisamuccedaka, because the abhi- really belongs with
                  the saṃdhi; it’s a possible break but is confusing to read.</p>
              </item>
              <item>One resource that is helpful for determining the breaks in Sanskrit chains in
                the online <ref target="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/sample/list-0.2.html">Cologne Sanskrit Dictionary</ref>. This one is really helpful because it has a
                drop down menu of similarly spelled words when you hit the enter key, however, I
                think this only works when you use the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Kyoto">Kyoto-Harvard Transliteration
                  scheme</ref> "KH." You might try the other ones but I found that this is the only
                one that gave the drop down list for me. Then when you find a big word in the
                dictionary in the definition entry you will see * whenever there is sandhi, though
                this isn't 100% reliable. Sometimes it is missing for some reason, so be careful if
                the spelling looks weird.</item>
              <item>In certain cases there may be long 15+ Sanskrit chains that cannot be broken due
                to the sandhi, or long Sanskrit compounds whose pieces cannot be easily determined
                with online resources. If this is the case make a list of problematic instances to
                note for the leading editors, and also check these instances to see if the pose any
                major difficultly for the web display. These instances are rare, but they do come up
                now and then.</item>
              <item>It is acceptable to add an optional hyphen at the end of "mahā-" as in
                "mahā-yāna" even though technically the long ā would be lost, as this is a well
                known word and unlikely to be misread.</item>
              <item>Note that when you add the optional hyphens to a glossary item where the
                translation uses the Sanskrit (This will mainly be in the “Persons” and “Places”
                section of the glossary) the hyphens will have to match all those instances within
                the body of the text or they will not link to the glossary term, so it is best to
                start from the glossary and work your way backwards. For all of these person and
                place terms do a search and replace so that the hyphens match in all the instances
                of that term (be cautious when doing large search-and-replaces that you don’t make
                any unintended changes).</item>

        <head>Guidelines for Using an XSLT Conversion Script</head>
        <p>Here are instructions for using an XSLT script in oXygen:</p>
        <list>
          <item>A. Click on “Configure Transformation Scenarios” (it should be a wrench with a red
            arrow on the oXygen ribbon).</item>
          <item>B. Select “New” &gt; “XML transformation with XSLT.”</item>
          <item>C. For the XSL URL: click on the drop down menu next to the folder and select
            “Browse Data Source Explorer.”</item>
          <item>D. Select the appropriate .xsl document from the database. For example the script
            for transforming a .docx created from the 84000 template can be found in: 84000
            Collaboration &gt; apps &gt; import-84000-data &gt; xsl &gt; oxGto84000.xsl.</item>
          <item>E. For the “Transformer:” confirm that “Saxon-PE 9.8.0.12” or the latest version of "Saxon-"  from the drop down menu.</item>
          <item>F. Click on the “Output” tab and check the box that says “Open in Editor.”</item>
          <item>G. Click okay, and then select “apply associated” (the transformation scenario you
            just made should be ticked under “projects”).</item>

        <head>Guidelines and Checklist for Updating the Schema and ODD</head>
        <p>Note that updating the schema and ODD is a bit more complicated, so this should be
          handled by the lead editors or technicians. Otherwise, if you are working on a markup and
          notice that the schema needs to be updated (i.e., there is some markup needed but you are
          getting a schema error for that markup), then make this a point to send to the lead
          editors in your final list of questions and issues for finalizing the text. Please
          disregard the following instructions unless you are a lead editor or technician.</p>
        <list>
          <item>This appendix gives a brief explanation and checklist for how to update the ODD.
              <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html">However, you
              may need to refer to the 22nd chapter of the TEI guidelines</ref> for a more detailed
            explanation on how the elements in the ODD work. You may also need to refer to the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html">23rd chapter of
              the TEI guidelines</ref> which contains information on the content models, attribute
            customizations, and TEI conformance.</item>
          <item>Most of the restrictions in the ODD are defined in the element specifications. In
            order to create documentation, an <gi>elementSpec</gi> has been created for all of the
            elements we use. There are also some schema restrictions defined in class
            specifications, <gi>classSpec</gi>, and macro specifications, <gi>macroSpec</gi>. In our
            ODD's XML the <gi>classSpec</gi>s are listed first followed by the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s
            followed by the <gi>elementSpec</gi>s all in alphabetical order. If you need to jump to
            a specific element, they can easily be found by searching for their <att>ident</att>
            attribute. For example, to find the <gi>elementSpec</gi> for the "front", search for
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">c ident="front"</egXML> and this will
            take you to that section of the ODD.</item>
          <item>Adding new elements will require creating a new <gi>elementSpec</gi> and adding it
            to the ODD. Adding or modifying attributes can be done in that specific element's
              <gi>attList</gi>. For example here is the <gi>attList</gi> for the <gi>title</gi>
            element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <attList>
                <attDef ident="type" mode="change">
                  <desc>classifies the title according to the TBRC typology.</desc>
                  <desc>classifies the title according to the 84000 typology.</desc>
                  <valList type="closed" mode="replace">
                    <valItem ident="mainTitle"/>
                    <valItem ident="longTitle"/>
                    <valItem ident="otherTitle"/>
                  </valList>
                </attDef>
                <attDef ident="xml:id" mode="delete"/>
                <attDef ident="level" mode="delete"/>
                <attDef ident="xml:lang" mode="change" usage="req"/>
              </attList>
            </egXML> The <gi>attDef</gi> defines a particular attribute for <gi>title</gi>, along
            with a description <gi>desc</gi>. The <gi>valList</gi> defines what values are allowed
            in the "type" attribute. Since we don't use the default "xml:id" and "level" attributes
            in our <gi>title</gi>s they have been set to "delete" so they won't appear in our
            documentation. We want the "xml:lang" to be required for all <gi>title</gi>s so the
            usage has been set to "reg". More details should can be found in the TEI guidelines. </item>
          <item> When a language needs to be added to the schema, the language list is actually
            found in the class specification for "att.global" that defines the "xml:lang" attribute.
            It should be added here so it will apply to all the elements that use "xml:lang". To
            find this section search for <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> attDef
              ident="xml:lang" </egXML>
          </item>
          <item>
            <hi rend="bold">Content Models:</hi> The structure for the schema--i.e., what elements
            are allowed to be nested in what elements--are contained in the ODD content models,
              <gi>content</gi>. Each element used in our TEI has a content model defined in its
            element specification, or if it isn't stated then the default TEI content model will
            be used when the schema is generated in from Oxgarage. You can look up the default
            content model in the <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html">appendix of the TEI Guidelines</ref>
            Because the 84000 schema is very restrictive, we use often directly use relax ng
            code within the ODD to define content models for the structure of the text. That is
            why you will see the prefix "rng:-" before many of the elements there. 
            When the content model needs to be updated, that is the rules which govern how the
            elements are to be nested, look for the <gi>content</gi> element in the ODD for that 
            element's <gi>elementSpec</gi>. If is a global rule for that element it will be found there.
            However, keep in mind if it is a rule specific to the order or structure found in the <gi>front</gi>,
              <gi>body</gi>, or <gi>back</gi>, then the content model will be found in those element's content models. 
          </item>
          <item>To avoid writing repetitive code, there are also some content models declared in the
              <gi>marcroSpec</gi> these may be referred to in other content models, which will look
            something like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <rng:ref name="paragraph"/>
            </egXML> In this example the rng element points to the content model of our basic
            paragraph. And if that needs to be updated in can be done so in the <gi>macroSpec</gi>
            for "paragraph". </item>
          <item>Note there are also many descriptions, <gi>desc</gi>, as well as examples
              <gi>egXML</gi> contained in all the specifications. It is not required to update these
            for the generation of the schema, but when you make in update, it would be good to
            update these as well so that our documentation can be most up to date. Also consider
            whether an update is something that the markup editors need to be aware of during their
            work flow. If it is, please add some explanation and/or protocol for the markup editors
            in the "Checklist for 84000 TEI Markup Editors". This appendix is found in the
              <gi>back</gi> of the ODD.</item>
          <item>Occasionally, we may add a new element to our schema that is already included in one
            of the standard TEI modules. Note, that these standard elements are all declared at the
            beginning of the ODD in the <gi>moduleRef</gi>. This happened to me, I couldn't figure
            out why the <gi>hi</gi> element wasn't validating even though it was declared in an
              <gi>elementSpec</gi>. The reason was I had assumed it was declared as a part of the
            "core" module, but had forgotten to add it to the list within the <gi>moduleRef</gi>. </item>
          <item>If you can't figure out why an added element or attribute isn't validating properly
            for a schema update. A good technique is to paste that element into a TEI document apply
            the schema, and read the schema error message at the bottom of the oXygen window. It
            should tell you what the schema is expecting and based on that you can determine where
            and which content model needs to be updated. Also keep in mind that any element from the
            standard TEI modules will have the default content model if a new one isn't declared, so
              <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html">you may need to look up the element in the TEI guidelines</ref> to find its default
            content model as well as its other parameters.</item>
          <item> To summarize here is a brief checklist for any updates for the ODD/schema. <list>
              <item>1) Make any changes to the element that needs update in that elements
                  <gi>elementSpec</gi>
              </item>
              <item>2) Does this change need to be reflected in the content model? If so make the
                appropriate corrections to the <gi>content</gi> found within the
                  <gi>elementSpec</gi>s for the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>,
                  <gi>back</gi>, or possibly one of the <gi>macroSpec</gi>s</item>
              <item>3) Update examples, <gi>egXML</gi> and/or descriptions <gi>desc</gi> if
                needed.</item>
              <item>4) Update the markup editor's checklist if needed.</item>

                        </label>
        <list>
          <item> The Xpath/XQuery builder is a useful tool for searching for unwanted stuff in the
            glossaries like brackets, slashes and so on. To open, go to Window &gt; Show View &gt;
            XPath/XQuery Builder </item>
          <item>For example to search for a bracket withing the glossary use the following code:
              <code>//gloss/term[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(text(), "(")]</code> The "(" at the
            end is what determines the bracket. Enter this into the XPath/XQuery Builder and press
            the play button to perform the search.</item>
          <item> To find an opening square bracket in the glossary use the following code:
              <code>//gloss/term[@xml:lang = 'Bo-Ltn'][contains(text(), "(") or contains(text(),
              "[")]</code>
          </item>
          <item> By using backslashes and element names you can also look for specific terms within
            particular elements, for example to search for a certain "word" within the <gi>note</gi>
            elements, you could use this code: <code>//note[contains(data(), 'word')]</code> Here
            'word' is what you are looking for. <code>//</code> means search everywhere,
              <code>//note</code> means search everywhere for <gi>note</gi>s. </item>

                            <item>
          You may notice that when you search for certain phrases in the XML, the phrase may not 
          be found in the "Find/Replace" dialog. This is because the search tool is very precise 
          so it will not find phrases with two or more words that are separated by a line break unless
          you specify it to do so. One way around this is to use the "Find in files" (click the second smaller magnifying 
          glass in the ribbon or CTRL/SHIFT/H). Then select "All opened files" (It will ask you to save before it searches)
          and make sure "Ignore white spaces" is checked ("Regular expressions" must be unchecked for it to work). It will then ignore the line breaks.
        </item>
        <item>
          The method above doesn't work with regular expressions. If you need to search in this way with regular expressions, then 
          try replacing the spaces in your code with: <code>\s+</code>, e.g. search "door of dharma" with "door\s+of\s+dharma"
        </item>
          <item>On occasion you may want to search the XML while ignoring all the tags. To do this, again use "find in files" CTRL/Shift/H 
            and in the field that says "Restrict to XPath;" enter the code <code>//text()</code>
                            </item>
          <item>This will ignore the tags in your search results. Note, it will ignore the tags but it can't 
          search over tags if a tag appears in the middle of a searched phrase, so for instance it won't fine "vidyā being" in the XML for 
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <label>
                    <hi rend="bold">Version Numbering:</hi>
                </label>
        <p>The three digit version numbering (e.g., "v 1.2.1") we are using here refer respectively to "major", "minor", and "revision" changes to the text (This emulates <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">software versioning standards</ref>).</p>
        <p>Any changes in the third decimal relate to very minor textual updates that don't substantially affect the text (typos, minor markup/formatting consistencies, etc.).    
          A change from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 signals to the reader that there is no need to download it. Any change in the second decimal relates to a minor, but more significant changes within the text itself as well as to significant markup changes. 
          For example, a missing stanza has been added, or a misspelled term has been corrected throughout the text.
          A change from 1.2.1 to 1.3.0 indicates that readers should download the latest version to have an improved version of the text. Any change in the first decimal would be a major change to the text, so 1.3.1 to 2.0.0. 
          would be a clear sign that it should be downloaded.</p>
        <p>To summarize:</p>
        <list>
          <item>Changes in the third decimal relate to very minor textual and markup changes, e.g., 1.3.4 to 1.3.5</item>
          <item>Changes in the second decimal relate to minor, but more significant textual and markup changes,  e.g., 1.3.4 to 1.4.0</item>

                </label>
        <p>Most texts that have not been started in the translation process have no version number. When a text receives its first update it will change to</p>
        <p>0.0.1</p>
        <p>When markup is started, the text gets an initial version number:</p>
        <p>0.1.1</p>
        <p>From that point on, version numbers will increase every time editors feel it’s necessary as they work on the text.  As noted before, changes made to the second decimal point are reserved for more significant textual and markup edits, and changes made to the third decimal point are reserved for minor textual and markup edits.  Theoretically, a text could go through many versions before it is ready for publication, eg</p>      
        <p>0.0.1 to 0.0.2</p> 
        <p>0.0.2 to 0.1.0</p>
        <p>0.1.0 to 0.1.1  etc</p>        
        <p>When the text is ready for publication then the version number is set by John or Mike to</p>
        <p>1.0.0</p>

        <list>
          <item>
            (1) When you make changes to a text, first check that the latest version is on distribution.  
            If not, notify Mike or John that you are making changes to the text and to not push it to distribution 
            until you are finished. This way a text that you are working on won’t be pushed to distribution until it is ready.
            Even if it is a relatively minor update, it is important to let admin know in case they are in the middle of pushing the
            texts to the published distribution database, in which case the changes may be incomplete or even just the
            version number could be missed.

            (3) If you changed any of the markup, run the automated tests on the individual file by clicking on "run tests" next to the
            text title from <ref target="http://utilities.84000-translate.org/translations.html">the Utilities page</ref> 
            (Note: don't run the automated tests from the "tests" tab unless it is necessary to check all the 
            texts, as this will uses up a lot of the server's resources). Correct any issues related 
            to failing test results or inform tech (Dom) about any test updates that may be needed.

            (4) Finally, after saving the TEI from Oxygen, the version number needs to be updated separately on 
            <ref target="https://projects.84000-translate.org/index.html">the project management page</ref>.
            This is important to keep track of any changes we've made to the published text:
            From the project management page, find the text according to its "text status," then click on "edit headers." From here, 
            update both the version number (as described in the guidelines above) and if necessary the version's date (entering for the date only a four digit year, e.g., "2019"). Note, the "Publication Date" refers to the date of the original
            publication, so please leave this unchanged. Please also add a brief note in the "Add a note about this version" field about
            what changes were made. Now, click the "Update" button. Updating the version number
            in this way will simultaneously update the <gi>editionStmt</gi>'s version and date within the TEI file,
            upload the latest version to the Github repository, and generate the newest version of the eBook and PDF (this last part of the update only
            occurs if it is status="1").
          </item>         
          <item>
            (5) Inform the lead markup editor (Mike), so that the updated files may be moved from collaboration to
            distribution.
          </item>
        </list>
        <lb/>
        <label>
                    <hi rend="bold">Global Changes:</hi>
                </label>
        <p>Occasionally, global changes will need to be made for all the texts, usually performed with a script or a search-and-replace in the translations folder (By the way if you
          make global search-and-replaces to a folder be sure that Oxygen's "Make back of files with extension" box is unchecked, as this will cause problems in the database).
          Since it would be time consuming to update each text manually, please follow this protocol for updating the texts manually:
        <list>
          <item>1.) Make the global change (using script or find and replace). Make sure that the operation has worked correctly.</item>
          <item>2.) Ask tech (Dominic) to run a script to update version numbers and add a descriptive note.</item>
          <item>3.) Take a snapshot to capture version history for git (This is on the Utilities page menu: "Make a Data Snapshot").</item>
          <item>4.) Assess whether pdfs, epubs, and html need to be republished immediately.  If so, then do it manually using utilities.  If not, then wait for the next change that warrants a republishing of the text. 
            Especially minor changes may not warrant updating all the publications as texts will be updated periodically, and the change will be added eventually.</item>
        </list>  
        </p>
        <lb/>

        <p>Whenever you make changes to a published text, you should always change the version number from project management. 
          When you start working on a text in markup use a version number beginning with 0.1.1. Generally, 
          we don't need a versioning history while the text is in the markup process, however, if the markup for 
          a text is particularly complex, e.g., it is a very large text, it includes attributes that require us to 
          come up with new markup language, it includes a complex outline structure, etc., you should
          occasionally update the version (e.g., 0.1.2) from project management as you processes different stages of the 
          markup. In such cases, it would also be a good idea to occasionally save a backup locally to your computer. This way
          we can track the text, and especially have a way of knowing what version it is in case
          something goes wrong (which does happen from time to time).</p>

        <head>Guidelines for Checking Older Versions of the TEI Documents in the Github Repository:</head>
        <p>Sometimes there may have been an edition or correction that was made in an earlier version 
          of a TEI file that was made in error or for some other reason we need to check that changes
          that were made in an earlier version of a document. In such cases, all the older versions of the
          XML are saved as snapshots in 84000's Github repository. To check older versions of the TEI 
          please follow these steps below:          
        </p>
        <list>
          <head>
                        <hi rend="bold">Read or Download Archived Files on Github</hi>
                    </head>

          You do not need a Github account to check the version history.</item>
          <item>From there you will be able to navigate to the TEI file you need. The repository should have
          the same outline and structure as the TEI database we work from on Oxygen.</item>
          <item>Once you navigated to the file you need click on the "History" button. This will take you
          to a new screen showing you a history of all the snapshots of the file, called "commits" on Github.</item>
          <item>By clicking on each commit, it will show you all the additions and deletions that were made to the file 
          at that time. The version number update should be close to the top of the page. From here, it is very 
          convenient to see what changes have been made to the file for each version update. </item>
          <item>Or you can simply download that version of the TEI file by first clicking on the three dots ... to 
          the right of the file name of that version, click "view file", the new screen click on the "download" button.
          (Note that some browsers will just open the XML on a new page, so you might need to right-click "Save Link As..."
          to download the actual file.</item>
        </list>
        <p>All the older versions of the files should be here since the time we begin syncing this Github 
        repository. Note that sometimes there may have been a few version updates before a commit, but there
        should be a record of all the differences between the version at the time of the commit and the previous one.

                    </head>
          <item>If needed, it is also possible to see how older versions of the TEI display in the Reading Room. First download
          the desired version of the TEI from Github following the instructions above.</item>
          <item>From the database explorer go to the folder in Collaboration/db/apps/84000-data/archived/tei/reference, then right click
          on the folder and select "import files." Select the file from your computer that you downloaded from Github.</item>
          <item>The following URL, with the Toh number entered into the TohXXX will load the archived file to the Reading Room
            on Collaboration: https://read.84000-translate.org/translation/tohXXX.html?archive-path=tei/reference</item>
          <item>The suffix "?archive-path=tei/reference" will likely work with some of the other formats as well.</item>
          <item>Note, there is currently an issue with this method; it doesn't work for Toh numbers's with a dash, e.g., "1-1"</item>
        </list>
        <p>There may also be some versions of antiquated formats in the repository, so if you don't see what you are looking for
        in the translations folder, you can also <ref target="https://github.com/84000">search in the main branch</ref>.</p>

        <head>Reporting Typos or Errors in the eKangyur:</head>
        <p>The eKangyur is typically very precise, but occasionally there may have been an error when they were inputting the text.  
          If you suspect a typo in the eKangyur, <ref target="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CswHWGssyAzNM5vLOCPLkLsQ7B9vlhXN0kyGF50chXM/edit?usp=sharing">please 
            note it in the spread sheet here</ref>. This should not include errors in the original block print, which we will leave as is,
          but there may have been an error in the text input of the eKangyur from the original scanned source. 
          The source of the eKangyur is the scanned LoC edition on tbrc.org, <ref target="https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W4CZ5369">W4CZ5369</ref> 
          (Although it follows the volume order of W22084, the Parphud edition on tbrc.org).  
          Occasionally the print may be illegible due to smudges, and so you may compare with <ref target="https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=W22084">W22084</ref>, which as far as I know is nearly identical.
          Of course, it not really our job to proof read the eKangyur, so don't spend hours checking for typos in the eKangyur; but you may happen 
          to notice an error now and then while checking the source, and in such case you can enter them into the spreadsheet and they can be reported to Esukhia at some point.</p>
