                <p tid="1">This sūtra contains teachings given by the Buddha to a 120-year-old woman in the city of Vaiśalī. Upon
                    meeting the Buddha, she asks him questions concerning the four stages of life, the aggregates, the elements,
                    and the faculties. In response, the Buddha gives her a profound teaching on emptiness, using beautifully
                    crafted examples to illustrate his point. </p>
                <p tid="2">After hearing these teachings her doubts are dispelled and she is freed from clinging to the perception
                    of a self. Ānanda asks the Buddha why he has given such profound teachings to this woman. The Buddha reveals
                    that the woman has been his mother five hundred times in previous lifetimes and that he had generated the root
                    of virtue for her to become enlightened. Because of her own strong aspirations, after dying, she would be born
                    in the buddhafield of Sukhāvatī, and after sixty-eight thousand eons she would finally become the buddha
                    Bodhyaṅga­puṣpa­kara.</p>

                    <p tid="5">Considering the cultural norms of the time, the fact that the teaching contained in this sūtra was
                        given entirely to a laywoman and, moreover, to a very old and impoverished laywoman, makes it stand
                        apart.</p>
                    <p tid="6">The setting of this text is Vaiśalī, the ancient capital of the Licchavis and of the Vṛji
                        confederacy of which the Licchavi republic was a member. The old lady, whose name we are never told, asks
                        the Buddha such profound questions that Ānanda realizes this is no ordinary woman but one whose wisdom
                        comes from merit collected in past lifetimes. As it turns out, the Buddha reveals that she has been his
                        mother for five hundred lifetimes.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-059-014-4"/>
                    <p tid="7">The main body of the text, which consists of the Buddha’s teachings in answer to the old lady’s
                        questions, is an explanation of emptiness. To put it briefly, the Buddha says no phenomenon arises of its
                        own accord. Neither does any phenomenon give rise to any other phenomenon. All phenomena arise owing to
                        their dependence upon collections of causes and conditions. Hence, there is no independent phenomenon,
                        though we may use terms to indicate various phenomena as if they were independent. After the Buddha’s
                        teaching the old lady realizes this profound truth. The Buddha prophesies that she herself will one day
                        become a buddha. In earlier lifetimes he had planted roots of virtue and made strong aspirations for her
                        to do so.</p>

                    <p tid="8">The following modern works should be mentioned. Frye (1979) provides us with an English translation
                        from the Mongolian version of the sūtra. Research on the date and translator attributions of the Chinese
                        versions is to be found in Nattier (2007). Durt (2005) discusses the theme of the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahallikā</foreign> (“old lady”) and the three Chinese versions (Taishō 559, 560, 561)
                        of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahallikā­paripṛcchā</title>. Most recently, Peter Skilling (2021) has included a 
                        translation of the sūtra and some helpful notes on it in his collection <title xml:lang="en">Questioning the Buddha: A Selection of Twenty-Five Sutras</title>.<!--<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-059-014-97">Skilling (2021), pp. 315–330.</note>-->

                    <p tid="9">There is no Sanskrit version extant. The primary Tibetan text used for the present translation was
                        the version in the Degé (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sde dge</foreign>) Kangyur, versions in the other
                        Kangyurs being also compared. The colophon of the sūtra states that it was translated under the guidance
                        of the abbots Jinamitra and Dānaśīla by the Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ye
                            shes sde</foreign>), from which we can conclude that this text must have been translated from Sanskrit
                        to Tibetan in the early ninth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> during the first major phase of the translation of Buddhist

                    <p tid="11">Thus did I hear at one time. When the Bhagavān was traveling in the land of Vṛji, he went to the
                        great city of Vaiśālī, together with a large saṅgha of 1,250 bhikṣus and a
                        vast number of bodhisattva mahāsattvas. At that time, he came across an old woman from the city gathering
                        grass in the countryside. She was decrepit and had reached the end of her lifespan, being 120
                        years old.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-059-014-9"/>
                    <p tid="12">The woman saw the Bhagavān coming from afar—handsome, inspiring, with senses tamed, mind tamed,
                        endowed with supreme discipline and serenity, guarded, faultless, senses controlled, pure and clear like
                        the sea, unclouded, upright like a golden sacrificial post, radiant with splendor clear and distinct,
                        wonderfully adorned with the thirty-two signs of a great being. When she saw him, faith grew in her mind.
                        Then, full of devotion, she approached <ref cRef="F.311.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-059-014-90"/> the Bhagavān, bowed her head at his feet,
                        circumambulated the Bhagavān three times, and sat to one side. </p>

                    <p tid="13">Bowing with her palms together in the direction of the Bhagavān, the woman then asked him, “O
                        Bhagavān, where does birth come from? Where does aging come from? Where do they go? O Bhagavān, where does
                        sickness come from? Where does death come from? Where do they go? O Bhagavān, where does form come from?
                        Where do sensation, notions, <term>formative factors</term>, and consciousness come from? Where do they go?
                        O Bhagavān, where does the earth element come from? Where do the water element, the fire element, the wind
                        element, the space element, and the element of consciousness come from? Where do they go? O Bhagavān, where
                        does the eye come from? Where do the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind come from? Where do
                        they go?”</p>

                    <p tid="14">The Bhagavān replied, “Sister, birth does not come from anywhere. Aging does not come from
                        anywhere. They do not go anywhere. Sister, sickness does not come from anywhere. Death does not come from
                        anywhere. They do not go anywhere. Sister, form does not come from anywhere. Sensation, notions,
                            <term>formative factors</term>, and consciousness do not come from anywhere. They do not go anywhere.
                        Sister, the earth element does not come from anywhere. The water element, the fire element, the wind
                        element, the space element, and the element of consciousness do not come from anywhere. They do not go
                        anywhere. Sister, the eye does not come from anywhere. The ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the
                        mind do not come from anywhere. They do not go anywhere.</p>

                    <p tid="15">“Sister, it is as follows: As an analogy, a fire arises based on a stick to rub with, a stick to
                        rub on, and also a person’s effort to generate it. That fire, moreover, once it has burnt the grass
                        and wood, will have no more causes and will die. Sister, where do you think the fire comes from and where
                        does it go?” </p>
                    <p tid="16">She answered, “O Bhagavān, that fire comes into being owing to the power of a collection of
                        causes. It ceases and dies when it lacks the collection of causes.” </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-059-014-13"/>
                    <p tid="17">“Sister,” said the Bhagavān, “likewise, all phenomena <ref cRef="F.311.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-059-014-91"/> come into being owing to
                        the power of a collection. They cease and die when they lack the collection. Whatever the phenomena, they
                        do not come from anywhere, nor do they go anywhere. Sister, it is as follows: although the eye
