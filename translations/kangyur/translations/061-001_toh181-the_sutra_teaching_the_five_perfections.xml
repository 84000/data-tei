                        sūtras that each present the practice of one of the five perfections (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pāramitā</foreign>) that bodhisattvas train in on the path of the Great Vehicle:
                        generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, and concentration. These five perfections embody

                        perfection of insight that is supposed to permeate the practice of the first five perfections.
                        Throughout this sūtra, the perfection of insight is taught as the practice of turning one’s mind
                        to the omniscient state while transcending conceptual reference points. Only by integrating the
                        perfection of insight into the practice of the other five trainings do they become genuine
                        perfections.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">Teaching the Five Perfections</title> unfolds as a conversation between the
                        Buddha and two of his close students, Śāradvatīputra (a.k.a. Śāriputra), who is praised in the
                        canonical literature as the foremost of the Buddha’s disciples in terms of wisdom, and Pūrṇa
                        Maitrāyaṇīputra, who is lauded as the foremost preacher of the Dharma. As for these two
                        outstanding disciples, we are told that they deliver their teachings on the perfections in a
                        conversation inspired and guided by the Buddha’s blessing. As is often the case in sūtra
                        literature, this is one of the ways in which bona fide “words of the Buddha” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">buddhavacana</foreign>) can be expressed. Throughout the text,
                        a wide range of topics is addressed, including the practice of nonconceptuality, the defining
                        characteristics of bodhisattvas, the importance of dedicating merit toward omniscience, the
                        distinction between bodhisattvas and hearers, and, of course, the distinctive practices of the
                        five perfections themselves. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-8"/>
                    <p tid="12">Over the course of discussing these topics, the Buddha and his two disciples address several
                        challenging issues, such as defending the efficacy and legitimacy of meritorious actions once
                        the lack of self has been realized, and repudiating objections that bodhisattvas do not
                        voluntarily embrace saṃsāra but are simply unable to obtain the cessation of the hearers and
                        thus forced to remain in existence. In treating these and many other philosophical themes in
                        detail, <title xml:lang="en">Teaching the Five Perfections</title> thus provides a wealth of
                        insight into the thought and practice of the Great Vehicle. The text presents the five central
                        “methods” of the Great Vehicle in a manner that stands out from the highly codified
                        presentations of the perfections that one finds in the commentarial literature. In this way the
                        sūtra provides not only a wealth of doctrinal teachings but also a host of imaginative and
                        humorous analogies that give us a rare glimpse of the cultural and social milieu in India during
                        the time of its composition. As such, the text should be of interest to a contemporary
                        readership concerned not only with the development of the Buddhist tradition and its scriptures,
                        but also with classical Indian culture in general.</p>

                    <p tid="13">Today only two short manuscript fragments of <title xml:lang="en">Teaching the Five
                            Perfections</title> have survived in Sanskrit.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-10"> See Bongard-Levin (1997)
                            and Karashima (2004) for transliterations of the Sanskrit fragments. The fragments
                            correspond to the following passages in the Degé Kangyur: 23.b.6–25.a.2 (Karashima 2004) and
                            36.a.7–37.a.3 (Bongard-Levin 1997).</note> A complete Chinese translation by Xuanzang (ca.
                        602–64) does, however, exist.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-11"> Taishō 220 (11–15).</note> Interestingly, the
                        Chinese canon treats each of these five sūtras as individual scriptures, indicating that the
                        texts most likely originally existed as distinct teachings that only later were compiled and
                        united under a single title by the editors of the Tibetan Kangyur.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-12"> This is
                            further corroborated by the fact that the Phukdrak and Gondhla Kangyur versions contain
                            individual Tibetan translator colophons for each of the five sūtras, thus reflecting their
                            status as separate texts in Tibet too, not just in China (Tauscher 2015: p. 380).</note>
                        Moreover, unlike the Tibetans, the Chinese tradition combines these five sūtras with the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Suvi­krānta­vikrāmi­paripṛcchā</title> from the Prajñāpāramitā section of the
                        Kangyur, which then is said to represent the teaching of the sixth perfection of insight.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-13"> Taishō 220 (16). In the Degé Kangyur, this sūtra is placed separately from the
                            other five, in the Prajñāpāramitā section (Toh 14). See also Bongard-Levin 1997: pp.
                            93–94.</note> Since this English translation is based on the version found in the Degé
                        Kangyur, we have here presented the five sūtras under the single title employed in that
                        collection. As for the Tibetan translation, the translators for this particular text are listed
                        in the colophon as the Indian preceptor Jinamitra and the Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé, who both
                        flourished during the late eighth and early ninth centuries. As such, the Tibetan translation,
                        which we have rendered into English here, would have been completed during the early translation

                            or the bodhisattvas. As such, individuals may have the power and strength to dedicate the

                            countless, and limitless worlds, wishing for the result of a worthy one, were to practice
                            generosity toward ordinary beings, hearers, and solitary buddhas for as many eons as there
                            are grains of sand in the Ganges. Bodhisattvas would reflect on that and declare, ‘I rejoice

                            creates a mass of merit. After rejoicing, they would then dedicate the merit in this manner:
                            ‘By means of these roots of virtue from having rejoiced, may all bodhisattva great beings in
                            all the limitless and endless worlds who have newly entered this vehicle reach the state of

                            the state of omniscience.’ The bodhisattvas who in this manner dedicated the roots of virtue
                            created by rejoicing would swiftly perfect the state of omniscience. Comparatively, the

                            approached by a beggar, they should never think, ‘I will give later,’ or, ‘I don’t have
                            enough to give.’ They should also never feel, ‘I cannot bear to give that away.’ If others
                            are generous, they should rejoice, encourage them, and be happy. Venerable Pūrṇa,
                            bodhisattva great beings should dedicate the merit that comes from rejoicing toward the
                            state of omniscience. When bodhisattvas rejoice by thinking of how these beings have

                            who initially were generous would not constitute even one percent of those created by the
                            mind that rejoices and dedicates toward the state of omniscience. Nor would they measure a
                            thousandth, a hundred thousandth, a millionth, or a trillionth of that. In fact, no number,
                            fraction, enumeration, analogy, or comparison would suffice. They would be surpassed by a

                            manifest, they come to take on new modes of rebirth. As they take on such modes of rebirth,
                            bodhisattvas are able to practice the perfection of generosity. Likewise, they become able

                            there would be nothing for the bodhisattvas to turn away from. In this way, bodhisattvas
                            must avoid engendering the attitude of the worthy ones; their states of consciousness are
                            not equal. They should abandon such an attitude, and instead arouse the attitude set upon
                            attaining the state of omniscience. In the same way, the attitude and consciousness of the
                            solitary buddhas also help the bodhisattvas to reach the state of omniscience. For without
                            the attitudes and consciousnesses of the worthy ones and the solitary buddhas, the
                            bodhisattvas could not be benefited. And why? Because a bodhisattva great being’s state of
                            mind is unique among all defiled and undefiled mind states. Compared to any other mind
                            state—excluding the mind of a thus-gone one—the mind of a bodhisattva is supreme, foremost,
                            superior, preeminent, sublime, unsurpassed, and unexcelled. Therefore, Venerable Pūrṇa,
                            these two levels can be beneficial to the bodhisattva great beings for reaching the

                            Instead, bodhisattvas should give free of any concepts and then dedicate the merit toward
                            the state of omniscience. When giving in this manner, it will be of benefit. Without
                            abandoning conceptuality in this way, they will never attain perfect awakening. </p>

                            gold coins, or hoarding millions of gemstones, should not be considered a great achievement.
                            Moreover, to give objects away in a manner that is beyond conceptuality and thereby awaken
                            to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood is the most exalted attainment of all. Even if one
                            were to attain the kingdom of a universal monarch of the four continents, but not abandon
                            conceptuality, it would not be a great achievement. And even if one were to rule the desire

                            those other achievements. This attainment by the bodhisattva great beings is unequaled; it
                            is the attainment of the state of a thus-gone one. <ref cRef="F.16.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-581"/> One should not be concerned with

                            Anyone who gives away their clothes, food, bedding, seats, medicines, and other implements
                            while skillfully dedicating the merit will attain omniscience. Therefore, one should

                            objects conceptually. This is why you will attain omniscience. Anyone who ever attained this

                            bodhisattvas’ skillfulness. And why? Because if these beings understood how to attain

                            in omniscience; none of them arouse that attitude. Therefore, as they do not engender the
                            mind set upon omniscience, neither do any of them attain that state. It is those who are
                            devoted to the state of omniscience and set their mind upon it <ref cRef="F.17.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-582"/> who attain that
                            state. After they set their mind upon omniscience, they also come to understand that any
                            object that they give away does not truly exist. So they tell themselves, ‘These entities
                            that I perceive are an illusion. They are not actually the way that I perceive them
                            conceptually.’ In this way they further develop their charitable attitude and generosity and
                            do not cling to things. However, even though the object is illusory, other beings do not
                            understand that and so they continue to cling so intensely to things and are unable to give
                            them away. Being unable to give anything away, they are gripped by miserliness. And due to
                            miserliness they take birth in the lower realms where they end up destitute. In this way, if
                            one is unable to give away or make use of an object, that object can become the cause of
                            miserliness and birth in the lower realms. Whenever skillful bodhisattva great beings
                            understand this, they will tell themselves, ‘This object is illusory and the act of giving
                            it away is also illusory. That which is illusory does not really belong to me, nor can it
                            truly be given away. And why? Because it is illusory. Nonetheless, I will now make an

                            the state of omniscience, one will become exalted over the hearers and the solitary
                            buddhas.</p>

                        <p tid="144">“Whoever produces roots of virtue in this regard and becomes accustomed to the mind of
                            awakening will receive a prophecy by the blessed buddhas, saying, ‘You will become a
                            solitary buddha. In such and such number of eons you will take birth among gods or men and
                            attain the state of a solitary buddha.’ However, Śāradvatīputra, the solitary buddhas do not
                            make a prophecy to the bodhisattvas, saying, ‘In the future you will become a thus-gone one,
                            a worthy, perfect buddha.’ <ref cRef="F.23.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-594"/> Nor do the hearers offer a prophecy to the bodhisattvas.
                            Even if the hearers were to offer such a prophecy, they would do so because of having heard
                            it from the Thus-Gone One. Śāradvatīputra, even if someone were to establish all beings in
                            the state of a hearer, that person would not have taken hold of the state of omniscience.
                            Still, Śāradvatīputra, whoever offers a bodhisattva the teachings on the six perfections
                            will take hold of the state of omniscience. And why is that? Śāradvatīputra, the reason is
                            that the awakening of the blessed buddhas does not manifest among the hearers; rather, the
                            awakening of the thus-gone ones occurs among the bodhisattvas.”</p>

                            not deserve the name <distinct>bodhisattva</distinct>. And why? Because such thoughts do not

                            cannot be harmed. Even if they hear the instructions of the hearers and solitary buddhas,

                            the perfection of generosity. Imagine bodhisattvas who might feed as many beings as there

                            bodhisattvas see another bodhisattva, they should serve that person with respect. Likewise,
                            if they see a practitioner who observes pure conduct, they should also serve that person
                            with respect. In the same way, they should serve all other beings with respect. Thus,
                            bodhisattvas should serve others with an attitude of humbleness, respect, politeness, and
                            humility. They should do so while forming the resolve, ‘Once I have awakened to unsurpassed
                            and perfect buddhahood, I will bring these beings to the state beyond suffering and teach
                            them the Dharma so that they may be free of afflictions.’ Venerable Pūrṇa, in this way
                            bodhisattva great beings should be humble and loving toward others. They should be the best
                            among beings. They should also bring out the best in them. And why? Because the best is
                            buddhahood. Thus, bodhisattvas should love all other beings while inspiring them to take the
                            Lord of the Dharma as their master.”</p>

                            that bodhisattvas become inseparable from the perfection of insight. That is the

                            omniscience. Thus, Blessed One, whenever bodhisattvas see that even disturbing emotions can
                            be of benefit, that is when those bodhisattva great beings become truly skilled in means.
                            Moreover, in this way bodhisattvas also observe discipline and do not excessively cling to
                            it.”</p>

                            taught. It is a true Dharma statement and a reply that fully conforms with the Dharma.
                            Śāradvatīputra, in this regard, when bodhisattva great beings observe the perfection of
                            discipline, they will form the wish, ‘By this practice of the perfection of discipline, may
                            all beings in all the endless and limitless worlds who practice a lapse in discipline, each
                            attain proper discipline as a result of my training in the perfection of discipline! May
                            they abandon their lapse in discipline and may this discipline of mine be of benefit to
                            everyone!’ If bodhisattvas think in this way, they should be regarded as being skilled in
                            means. The more they are able to dedicate their discipline, the more their perfection of
                            discipline will flourish. <ref cRef="F.49.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-647"/> The more their perfection of discipline flourishes, the
                            more those bodhisattvas come to uphold the boundless Dharma. By not limiting their
                            discipline, bodhisattvas come to uphold the boundless Dharma. Moreover, bodhisattvas should
                            dedicate their merit by focusing on other bodhisattvas, saying, ‘May all beings in all the
                            limitless worlds who have newly entered the bodhisattva vehicle become nonregressing by
                            means of my discipline, and may all nonregressing bodhisattvas quickly perfect the state of
                            omniscience!’ The more bodhisattvas are able to dedicate merit in this way, the more they
                            avoid straying from the mind of omniscience and the closer they are to that state. In this
                            way those bodhisattvas’ boundless perfection of discipline will increase endlessly. </p>

                            constant concern to liberate all beings from the sufferings they experience in saṃsāra.

                            attachment or anger. In fact, there could not possibly be such a thing. And why? Because the
                            blessed buddhas have relinquished all attachment and anger. Still, Śāradvatīputra, we do say
                            that the Thus-Gone One does not abandon bodhisattvas. And why? Because the Thus-Gone One
                            continues to train bodhisattva great beings in the six perfections and steadily spreads the
                            light of the Dharma in the world. Śāradvatīputra, since the blessed buddhas perceive this
                            ultimate perspective, they decide to instruct and teach the bodhisattvas. Therefore, even
                            when the Thus-Gone One passes away, bodhisattvas can still gradually awaken to unsurpassed

                            of thousands of beings can find shelter from the torments of heat, wind, sun, and hail.
                            Sitting in the shade of that tree they feel happy and at ease. These beings come to
                            appreciate the shade to the extent that the thought of going somewhere else never occurs to
                            them. Whatever functions the former tree fulfilled are now taken over by that new tree.
                            Likewise, Śāradvatīputra, as the bodhisattva great beings gradually train in the six
                            perfections and awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood within this very buddha realm,
                            they fulfill the same functions as the other thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddhas, teaching
                            the Dharma in order to eradicate the disturbing emotions of limitless beings. Thus,
                            intelligent beings come to experience the Dharma and Vinaya and later have no wish to
                            abandon that Dharma and Vinaya. </p>

                            the patience of the hearers is limited, while the patience of the bodhisattvas is boundless.
                            The patience of the bodhisattvas is boundless because it is aimed at accomplishing the
                            welfare, benefit, and happiness of boundless beings. To that end they don their armor and
                            free limitless and countless beings from suffering. The patience of the hearers is merely
                            aimed at abandoning their personal disturbing emotions and therefore, Venerable, it is a
                            limited form of patience, while the patience of the bodhisattvas is boundless. Anyone who
                            becomes hostile, disrespectful, or impatient toward an individual who has adopted the
                            bodhisattvas’ perfection of patience will produce a great deal of nonvirtue. Venerable
                            Śāradvatīputra, moreover, even if the Thus-Gone One were to scold bodhisattva great beings,
                            they should not get hostile. Similarly, if they should be criticized and rebuked by people
                            such as outcasts, bamboo workers, and those of the lower castes, they must not become
                            hostile or angry, even at such people. If they can avoid becoming hostile and angry, those
                            bodhisattva great beings will uphold the perfection of patience. Then they can gradually
                            train in the perfection of patience until they finally accomplish it. If they observe the
                            perfection of patience in this way, they become able to have forbearance in the face of

                            aggressive, confrontational, or argumentative, bodhisattvas should be conciliatory and try
                            to make peace. They should think to themselves, ‘I will not quarrel with or provoke you. Nor

                            buddhahood, I will teach you the Dharma.’ When that karmic act ripens, the signs of a great
                            being will manifest on the bodhisattva great beings’ body in the form of teeth that are well

                            severed from my past bodies were to be piled up, the heap would be larger than Mount Meru.’
                            Bodhisattva great beings who perceive the implications of this should therefore not feel any

                            of bodhisattva great beings are like the earth, <ref cRef="F.56.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-661"/> water, fire, wind, and space.”</p>

                        <p tid="379">Pūrṇa replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattvas should consider the mind within their
                            body to be like space. If they can reason and think in this way, then the bodhisattva great
                            beings will have the strength and skill to bear the blows of sticks, clubs, and weapons.
                            Likewise, by means of the perfection of wisdom, they should understand all bodies in this
                            way. Then the bodhisattvas can uphold the perfection of patience. Since they embrace the
                            perfection of wisdom, they will have the strength to bear all the sufferings experienced by
                            beings in the hells, including the fires and the blows of the hell beings’ weapons and
                            sticks. The ability to bear hardship is itself the perfection of patience. Why? Since
                            beginningless time in saṃsāra, bodhisattvas have experienced all of these sufferings.
                            However, even though they had to suffer in this way, they did not attain the result of a
                            stream enterer, nor the result of a once returner, nor the result of a non-returner, nor the
                            state of a worthy one, nor did they attain awakening by themselves. However, as bodhisattva
                            great beings perceive the implications, they should be able to bear those sufferings. As an
                            analogy, if a man has a delicious meal, he will feel satisfied, delighted, happy, pleased,
                            joyful, and content. He might even feel exhilarated. Likewise, when bodhisattvas see a
                            beggar, even if it is someone who wants to harm those bodhisattvas, they should feel the
                            same joy, deference, and respect for the beggar as a worthy one who has exhausted all
                            defilements <ref cRef="F.57.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-662"/> would feel if he saw the Thus-Gone One. They should then dedicate the
                            entire mental process involved toward omniscience. Doing so, those bodhisattva great beings
                            are upholding the perfection of patience.”</p>

                            scolded, they should not retaliate but remain patient. And why? Because that way they do not
                            abandon omniscience. Even if they are struck, they should not fight back. When people are
                            hostile, they should not get angry. When they are abused, they should not repay in kind.
                            When people revile them, they should not reciprocate. Instead, they should simply remain
                            forbearing. And why is that? Because that way they do not abandon omniscience. Even if
                            others stab them with spears or arrows, they should not become angry, impatient, disturbed,
                            or short-tempered. If they can succeed in that manner, those bodhisattvas will be practicing
                            the perfection of patience and even their body will begin to shine with a golden complexion.
                            Venerable Śāradvatīputra, in this way bodhisattva great beings should possess the strength
                            of patience and the willingness to joyfully accept difficult situations. If you wonder why,
                            it is because with patience and joyful acceptance they can uphold the perfection of
                            patience, approach the omniscient state, and distance themselves from the sufferings of
                            saṃsāra. However, if bodhisattvas are attracted to the levels of the hearers or the solitary
                            buddhas, their practice of the perfection of patience is weakened. Why? Because, if they are
                            attracted to the levels of the hearers or the solitary buddhas, no matter how much suffering
                            they take upon themselves, <ref cRef="F.57.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-663"/> those bodhisattvas have abandoned their proper

                        <p tid="385">Śāradvatīputra asked, “Venerable Pūrṇa, what is the proper domain of bodhisattvas?”</p>
                        <p tid="386">Pūrṇa replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattvas should be concerned with the six
                            perfections and the state of omniscience. The domain of the bodhisattvas consists of the
                            perfection of generosity, the perfection of discipline, the perfection of patience, the
                            perfection of diligence, the perfection of concentration, and the perfection of insight.
                            When bodhisattvas are practicing these perfections, they engage in the proper domain of
                            bodhisattvas. For such people, even the evil Māra will find no opportunity to cause any
                            harm. As an analogy, a fox is unable to harm a tortoise and when it realizes that, it tires
                            and leaves. In the same way, Venerable Śāradvatīputra, when bodhisattvas train in the six
                            perfections, the evil Māra can find no chance to harm them and, realizing that, he tires and
                            leaves. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, even if the evil Māra were to emanate as many evil demons
                            as there are beings in the entire trichiliocosm and equip each of those demons with a
                            retinue of that same number of demons, they would find no opportunity to harm the
                            bodhisattva great beings who are practicing the six perfections. Not having any success,
                            they would tire and leave, just like the fox leaves the tortoise. <ref cRef="F.58.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-664"/> Venerable
                            Śāradvatīputra, therefore, bodhisattva great beings should tell themselves, ‘Whatever
                            happens, I will never relinquish the six perfections. If I succeed in that, the evil Māra
                            shall have no chance to harm me.’ ”</p>

                        <p tid="388">Pūrṇa replied, “Venerable Śāradvatīputra, one can tell that bodhisattva great beings are
                            influenced by demons if they do not listen to the perfections. Likewise, one can tell that
                            bodhisattvas are influenced by demons if they are not accomplishing the perfections.
                            Bodhisattvas should not become hostile or lose their patience even if they realize, ‘This
                            demon is approaching me in order to create obstacles for my attainment of omniscience.’ If
                            bodhisattva great beings can act like that, they are practicing the perfection of patience.
                            The bodhisattvas should then think, ‘When I awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, I
                            will teach the Dharma to all beings in order to eradicate their attachment, anger, and
                            delusion.’ If bodhisattva great beings can be mindful at that time, they will overcome the
                            evil Māra. Whenever bodhisattvas lose sight of the state of omniscience, they should tell
                            themselves, ‘I have strayed into an incorrect domain.’ And why? Because in that way they can
                            reprimand themselves saying, ‘I have lost sight of omniscience.’ ”</p>

                            called for. I will remain under my Lord’s command.’ Pūrṇa, in the same way bodhisattva great

                            should think, ‘As long as I take rebirth and circle in saṃsāra, for that long others will
                            also transition and circle in saṃsāra. So I will have to continue taking rebirth and
                            circling in saṃsāra. However, while they will not awaken to unsurpassed and perfect
                            buddhahood, I will awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood.’ They may also think,
                            ‘Actions follow after intentions. Even the sun appears through a mere wish.’ Those who think

                            beings who wish to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood rest evenly in the first
                            concentration, they should think to themselves, ‘Previously I have also rested in this
                            concentration, and as I rested in this first concentration, I nevertheless took birth in
                            saṃsāra, which is without beginning or end.’ Contemplating in this manner, they should
                            refrain from resting in this equipoise and instead use it as a basis for awakening to
                            unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Likewise, when resting evenly in the second, third, and
                            fourth concentrations, those bodhisattvas should think, ‘In the past I likewise rested in
                            this concentration and, although I did so, I nevertheless took birth in saṃsāra, which is
                            without beginning or end. In the past I already developed these concentrations.’ As they
                            consider this, they should avoid resting in these concentrations and instead utilize them
                            for awakening to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. <ref cRef="F.65.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-001-679"/> Based on the fourth

                        <p tid="431">“Furthermore, bodhisattvas should think, ‘Just as the bodhisattvas of the past trained by
                            resting evenly in the perfection of concentration, so I will also train now.’ When
                            bodhisattvas wish in this way to practice the perfection of concentration, they must also
                            accomplish the perfection of insight. Śāradvatīputra, using the fourth concentration as a
                            basis, bodhisattva great beings should not rest within it in order to actualize the
                            exhaustion of defilements, but rather regard it as their foundation for attaining
                            unsurpassed and perfect awakening. When bodhisattvas rest in the fourth concentration, they
                            should never savor the experience of concentration, the bliss of concentration, or the
                            related results of concentration. Nevertheless, they should still use the concentration as a
                            basis. With the fourth concentration as a basis, they should rest evenly in the field of
                            limitless space and accomplish that state. Gradually, they should then rest in and
                            accomplish the field of limitless consciousness, the field of nothing whatsoever, and the
                            field of neither perception nor no perception. However, even though they use these four
                            meditation states of the formless realm as a basis, they should not savor these

                            them. When bodhisattva great beings cultivate the four concentrations and the four
                            attainments of the formless realm as foundations, they focus on the world of those who
                            experience desire. In doing so, they will once again manifest a physical body in the realm

                            buddhahood, they must train in the perfection of concentration and accomplish the perfection

                            attainments of the bodhisattvas, those of the hearers are more exalted. If anyone should
                            wonder why, Blessed One, it is because the hearers have nine gradual attainments whereas the
                            bodhisattvas only rest in eight attainments. In this way the hearers have one more
                            absorption, and so, compared to the bodhisattvas, the hearers are superior in terms of their

                            enter that attainment. And why? Because the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha does not grant
                            his permission, fearing that they would fall into the levels of the hearers or the solitary
                            buddhas. Pūrṇa, let me provide you some analogies for this, since some dull-witted people
                            may better understand this point by means of an analogy. </p>

                            outlying districts. Although the universal monarch does not travel to those places himself
                            and even though he does not live there, he reigns in those countries and the people of those
                            areas abide by his command. In this way the universal monarch is in control of his realm.
                            Pūrṇa, likewise, bodhisattva great beings do not enter the attainment in which perceptions
                            and feelings have ceased and yet they have full control over that attainment. It is only
                            when bodhisattvas take their place at the seat of awakening that the time is right for them
                            to rest in that absorption. And why? Because otherwise they fear abiding in the state of a
                            hearer, or remaining at the level of a hearer, or becoming like a hearer.</p>

                            a market and expresses the wish to have a drink of wine, a skilled chamberlain will tell
                            him, ‘Your Majesty, this is not a suitable time to drink. It is not the proper occasion.
                            Instead, Your Majesty, you should enjoy your drink when you visit the royal harem.’ Now,

                            the chamberlain does not give him any. And why? Because, as the ruler of many hundreds of
                            cities as well as many regions with several hundreds of thousands of people, it would not be
                            proper for him to drink wine in the middle of a marketplace. Pūrṇa, likewise, with the
                            consciousness that bodhisattva great beings possess, they certainly do have the capacity to
                            rest in the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings, yet the blessed buddhas
                            do not grant them permission. And why? Because for the time being this is not the proper
                            context or occasion to rest in the attainment of the cessation of perceptions and feelings.
                            Pūrṇa, the bodhisattva great beings eventually will rest in the attainment of the cessation
                            of perceptions and feelings, when they have abandoned all perceptions and all conceptuality
                            and thus actualize the sphere of immortality. However, that time and occasion will come in
                            the future at the time and occasion when they sit at the seat of awakening. Because they
                            then transcend all perceptions, they accomplish the attainment of the cessation of
                            perceptions and feelings. As they thus awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, they

                            from such freedom, then they can accomplish and rest in the first concentration. In the same
                            way they accomplish and rest in the second, third, and fourth concentrations. Thus they also
                            accomplish and rest in the attainments of the field of limitless space, the field of
                            limitless consciousness, the field of nothing whatsoever, and the field of neither
                            perception nor no perception. Thus, they rest in the concentrations and attainments related
                            to the form and formless realms. However, once they have become acquainted with and reveled
                            in these states, they once again turn their attention to the desire realm. And why? Due to
                            fear of taking birth among the gods of the form or formless realms. By resting in the
                            concentrations of the form or formless realms, one may take rebirth there, and therefore one
                            should be on guard to prevent that by turning away from such rebirths. Thus, skillful
                            bodhisattvas should tell themselves, ‘If I am born among the gods of the form or formless
                            realms, many thousands of beings will be displeased and I risk becoming far removed from any

                            place of senseless beings.’ Thinking in this way allows the bodhisattvas skillfully to
                            attain the attainments of the form and formless realms and become familiar with them, while,
                            also due to their skillful means, once again taking rebirth in the desire realm.</p>

                            remedy, he can then approach the king without a male organ and say, ‘Your Majesty, please
                            listen to me! I have no male organ and because of this unfortunate situation I request the
                            position of guarding Your Majesty’s royal harem.’ Having verified this, the king may then
                            assign the man to his harem. Once in the harem, the man can then apply another remedy that
                            makes his male organ reappear, thus enabling him to sleep with the chief royal consort for
                            one, two, or even three months straight. However, at that point the man might begin to
                            worry, thinking, ‘If the king finds out about this, he will surely have me killed! So, I
                            must find a way to escape surely and safely from this royal palace.’ He will then address
                            the king once more, saying, ‘Your Majesty, please listen to me! My male organ has suddenly
                            reappeared and so it is no longer fitting that I remain in Your Majesty’s royal harem.’ The
                            king will then think to himself, ‘Oh, this is certainly a virtuous man! Since he arrived
                            here, he has lived in my harem in such an honorable manner!’ The king will then reward the
                            man with fine clothing and gifts before finally letting him go. Due to his skillfulness and
                            knowledge of medicinal remedies, at first he was able to infiltrate the royal harem and

                            <term type="definition">The capital of the ancient Indian kingdom of Kośala, and the setting for many sūtras, as the Buddha spent most rainy seasons in a park outside the city called the Jeta Grove. The city has been identified with the present-day Sāhet Māhet in Uttar Pradesh on the banks of the river Rapti.</term>
                            <term type="definition">The <term type="ignore">name</term> Śrāvastī is explained as being derived from the
                                <term type="ignore">name</term> of a sage, Śravasta, who used to live in that
                                area (this explanation is found in the commentary <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Nibandhana</title>, Samtani 1971, p. 77, and is also found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ṭīkā</title> on <title xml:lang="en">Distinctly Ascertaining

                                sources offer three explanations for the term: one is the one just mentioned, that
                                Sāvatthī is derived from Savattha, just like other city <term type="ignore">names</term> (Kākandī, Mākandī, Kosambī); alternatively, it is so called
                                because “everything is there” in terms of possible objects of enjoyment for humans;
                                and lastly the <term type="ignore">name</term> refers to the reply, “there is
                                everything,” that the Buddha offered when asked about what kind of shops were there

                                this derivation seems to be implied in one of the explanations of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Artha­viniścaya­ṭīkā</title>.<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4365.html"/>
