                    on magic and exorcism. The instructions on ritual practices that constitute its
                    main subject matter are intended to give the practitioner mastery over worldly
                    divinities and spirits. Since the ultimate controller of such beings is
                    Vajrapāṇi in his form of Bhūtaḍāmara, the “Tamer of Spirits,” it is Vajrapāṇi
                    himself who delivers this tantra in response to a request from Śiva.
                    Notwithstanding this esoteric origin, this tantra was compiled anonymously
                    around the seventh or eighth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, introducing
                    for the first time the cult of its titular deity. Apart from a few short ritual

                    remains the only major work dedicated solely to Bhūtaḍāmara.</p>

                    <p tid="8">There are many uncertainties regarding the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>, one of them being its canonical
                        classification. Although it is included in the Kriyā Tantra section of the
                        Degé canon, some Tibetan sources describe it as a Caryā text (Cabezón 2013,
                        pp. 119–120). Based on the contents, which include both Kriyā and Yoga
                        Tantra material, assigning it to the Caryā class is not entirely without
                        justification. However, even though some parts of the ritual have an
                        unmistakable Yoga Tantra character, the soteriological aims common to the
                        Yoga Tantras are never explicitly stated. As the elements of this tantra
                        characteristic of Kriyā Tantra clearly predominate, its classification as
                        such seems correct. Based on its affiliation with Vajrapāṇi, this text
                        belongs to the Vajra family (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vajrakula</foreign>) among the sub-classes of the Kriyā Tantras, rather
                        than the Tathāgata or Padma families</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-095-002-4"/>
                    <p tid="9">Another uncertainty is the age of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara
                            Tantra</title>. There are no titles of earlier works or names of
                        historical figures to help us assess its date of composition. There appears
                        to be, however, two strata of material in the text, corresponding to the
                        division into the Kriyā and the Yoga Tantra content. The older strata
                        primarily contain non-Buddhist, pre-Vajrayāna magical lore not yet fully
                        assimilated in formal Buddhist structures. This content likely belongs to
                        the fourth or fifth centuries, its age being demonstrated by the recurrent
                        use of the word <distinct>dīnāra</distinct>, a coin named after the Roman
                            <distinct>denarius</distinct>. This type of coin was popular in India in
                        the fourth and fifth centuries and is well attested in the literature of
                        that period.</p>

                    <p tid="10">Features of Yoga Tantra can be found chiefly in chapter eight, where the
                        visualization procedure, described as part of the main sādhana of
                        Bhūtaḍāmara, includes most of the elements of deity yoga practice, including
                        a sophisticated development stage (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">utpattikrama</foreign>) practice. Based on the inclusion of these
                        practices, it is unlikely that this section was composed prior to the
                        seventh century. The mention of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara
                            Tantra</title> in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī</title>—Vilāsavajra’s commentary to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti</title>—which is probably the earliest reference to the
                            text,

                            century. Therefore, it seems most likely
                            that the Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra was composed some time during the seventh
                            and the eighth centuries.

                    <p tid="12">The central deity in this tantra is Bhūtaḍāmara, a wrathful form of
                        Vajrapāṇi. In the tantra he is referred to by a variety of names, including
                        Vajrapāṇi, Vajradhara, Guhyakādhipati, Mahākrodhādhipati, Mahākrodha,
                        Krodharāja, Krodha, or simply by the title Blessed One (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavān</foreign>). It needs to be noted,
                        however, that in the Kriyā Tantras Vajradhara has not yet become a deity
                        iconographically distinct from Vajrapāṇi, and so “Vajradhara” is used merely
                        as an epithet for Vajrapāṇi. Likewise, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhyakādhipati</foreign>—one of the most common titles of
                        Vajrapāṇi in Buddhist literature—refers in the early Kriyā Tantras to
                        Vajrapāṇi’s status as lord of the guhyakas, a class of semi-divine beings,
                        and not as the “Lord of Mysteries” as intended in later tantric systems. It
                        is therefore a matter of doubt whether the Tibetan translators of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title> were correct in rendering
                        this title as “Lord of Mysteries” (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gsang ba’i bdag
                            po</title>). One could guess that, since they made their translation in
                        the eleventh century, they opted for an interpretation which, by then, would
                        certainly have been predominant. But since the “mysteries” or “secrets”
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhya</foreign>), such as the
                        “secret” body, speech, and mind, are never mentioned in the tantra, it is
                        unlikely that the latter interpretation was originally intended here. On the
                        other hand, the title “Lord of Guhyakas” seems to better fit the context of
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>, as guhyakas are
                        high on the list of beings with magical abilities (perhaps not far behind
                        vidyādharas) that yield to Bhūtaḍāmara’s power. The rest of Vajrapāṇi’s
                        epithets all contain the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">krodha</foreign> (“wrath”), reflecting the wrathful nature of
                        Bhūtaḍāmara.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-095-002-8"/>
                    <p tid="13">There is also considerable confusion regarding the names of the principal
                        deities and spirits featured in the tantra’s rituals. The lists of names
                        presented in the individual recensions do not always align, and in some
                        sources the number either falls short of or exceeds the expected set of
                        eight deities. No attempt has been made in our translation to definitively
                        standardize the lists of these names, as it is perhaps better to allow for
                        some doubt than to venture arbitrary guesses.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-095-002-9"/>
                    <p tid="14">Another ambiguity in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>
                        concerns the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign>,
                        such as is found in the name of the titular deity, and its feminine
                        equivalent <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtinī</foreign>. In the
                        tantra this term first and foremost refers to the bhūta order of spirits who
                        need to be tamed, such as the “eight great bhūtas” or the “eight great
                        bhūtinīs.” We reserve the use of the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtinī</foreign> for this class of beings. The terms <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtinī</foreign> are also applied to
                        other classes of non-human beings in this text, including the gods of the
                        highest orders. In these instances we have elected to translate <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtinī</foreign> as “male spirits” and
                        “female spirits” respectively.</p>

                        terms for certain similar rites that would be difficult to differentiate in
                        English translation. A sādhana procedure, for example, may include several

                        taken place throughout the tantra’s long textual history—possibly through
                        corruption or intentional redaction—that present challenges for the modern
                        reader. The reader may therefore find it helpful to think of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title> as a jigsaw puzzle that
                        needs to be reassembled rather than try to find coherence in the arrangement
                        of the extant recension of the text. As will be demonstrated in the summary
                        that follows, these textual irregularities present themselves from the very
                        beginning of the text and continue throughout. They include the omission of
                        standard scriptural formulas, irregular use of section and chapter
                        colophons, confusion in the names and number of sets of deities, and general
                        incongruities in the content of the tantra. </p>

                        begins not with the expected “Thus have I heard . . .” but with advice given
                        by Vajrapāṇi who begins with the standard Sanskrit phrase for introducing a
                        new topic, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">athātas</foreign>. What follows is not the usual scriptural formulation that
                        introduces the context for the teaching, but rather a seemingly isolated
                        piece of practical advice related to the practices that will be taught later
                        on in the text.</p>

                        unnecessary places. Additionally, some of these colophons refer not to the
                        main content of their given chapter, but to the content of a preceding
                        section. As the colophons do not specify chapter numbers or provide other
                        organizational information, it is possible that what had been section
                        colophons in earlier versions of the text had become chapter colophons in
                        its later recensions. This confusion between section and chapter colophons
                        is apparent in the different structures presented in the Buddhist and Śaiva
                        versions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>. The
                        extant Buddhist version has as many as twenty-eight chapters, some
                        unnaturally short, while its Śaiva counterpart has only sixteen. No attempt
                        has been made in this translation to restore chapter divisions or to
                        re-order the contents sequentially, as this would amount to redacting rather
                        than translating the text. </p>

                        including the highest orders of gods, and their pledge of allegiance to
                        Vajrapāṇi to offer every form of help to those who recite Vajrapāṇi’s
                        mantra. The first to come forward and make a pledge is Aparājita, the chief
                        among the eight bhūta kings, whose sādhanas, among the most prominent in the
                        tantra, are taught in its final sections. Reflecting his complete thraldom,
                        Aparājita serves as a pedestal for the feet of Bhūtaḍāmara in his form as
                        the “lord of the maṇḍala.” </p>

                    <p tid="21">When challenged by Śiva, Vajrapāṇi demonstrates his awesome power by using
                        mantra to first kill and then revive all the worldly deities and spirits,
                        including Brahmā, Indra, and Śiva himself. With the mantra “that slays all
                        spirits,” vajra-flames issue from the pores of Vajrapāṇi’s skin, causing
                        everyone’s death. With the mantra “that brings back the consciousness of the
                        dead,” a stream of vivifying air issues forth from Vajrapāṇi’s nostrils,
                        restoring them to life. Following this demonstration, an augural comment is
                        made by the tathāgatas that in future times, whenever necessary, Vajrapāṇi
                        will be the one to tame and subjugate worldly divinities and spirits. And
                        indeed, throughout Vajrayāna literature this function is more often assigned
                        to Vajrapāṇi in his wrathful forms than to any other deity. </p>

                        higher-order beings, Mahādeva-Śiva himself is the next to come forward and
                        pledge fealty. His pledge marks a fundamental change in the hierarchies of
                        the spirit world, as, following his lead, all the worldly divinities and
                        spirits who had been under Śiva’s control join their master as subordinates
                        to Vajrapāṇi. Mahādeva is perhaps the most important character in the tantra
                        after Vajrapāṇi. He becomes Vajrapāṇi’s interlocutor who prompts him with
                        requests to teach throughout the tantra. He also occupies the most prominent
                        position in the inner circle of deities in the maṇḍala of

                        non-human beings, with female figures leading the way, recognize Vajrapāṇi,
                        in his form Mahākrodha (Great Wrath), as their master. Even if the word
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śaraṇa</foreign> (“refuge”) is
                        not used, their act is, for all intents and purposes, one of taking refuge.
                        Each of these female spirits discloses her heart mantra to Vajrapāṇi, an act
                        that, because of a poetic use of puns, also indicates they are giving him
                        their heart. Each of the individual spirits’ pledges to Vajrapāṇi
                        establishes a bond between the spirit and the deity and, by extension,
                        between the spirit and the practitioner who recites the Vajrapāṇi mantra and
                        performs the spirit’s sādhana. The sādhana is the means to summon these
                        spirits and hold them to their pledge (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samaya</foreign>).</p>

                        or even fails to heed the summoning call, will perish. There is some
                        ambiguity, however, as to whether it is the spirit or the practitioner that
                        will perish if the sādhana goes awry. The language of most of the sādhanas
                        found in the text clearly indicates that it is the spirit who will perish,
                        but there are at least two instances in the Sanskrit sources of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title> that could be interpreted
                        either way. A variant in one manuscript makes it clear that it is the
                        practitioner who will die if they fail in their performance of the ritual.
                        If it is in fact the case that the warning extends also to the practitioner,
                        the threat of death could apply equally to the performance of all the
                        sādhanas in the tantra. It would then serve as a reminder of the dangers
                        inherent to practices intended to gain control over spirits. Once the spirit
                        is brought under control, however, it will unfailingly provide for all the

                        themselves to Vajrapāṇi and the practitioner. In a statement found in the
                        introduction to the last two sādhanas in the text we are told that these
                        sādhanas—and, by implication, possibly also all the preceding sādhanas—are
                        mutually thrilling for the bhūtinīs and the practitioner, and that the
                        bhūtinīs become filled with joy. This statement concludes the tantra’s

                        night to a lonely place, offering oblations of prescribed articles into the
                        ritual fire, and reciting the mantra a certain number of times. Sometimes
                        the practitioner is directed to step upon an effigy of the spirit whom he is
                        summoning. Within a specified time the spirit will arrive in person. After
                        welcoming her with offerings, one should perform the prescribed duties
                        associated with the role the spirit will take, either as a mother, sister,
                        or wife. Pleased, she will henceforth perform her specific duties, and

                        life, which is magically extended to hundreds or thousands of years. This

                    <p tid="31">In the center of the first maṇḍala is Vajrapāṇi Great Wrath in his form as
                        Bhūtaḍāmara. His iconography is described in full, and the deities and
                        spirits comprising his retinue are listed, including the most important
                        Hindu gods starting with Śiva. These gods, again in groups of eight, occupy
                        the inner and outer circles of the maṇḍala, with the middle circle reserved
                        for the eight goddesses of offering. Following these iconographic details
                        the ritual for initiating disciples into the maṇḍala is described, after
                        which are presented the instructions on the main sādhana of Bhūtaḍāmara,
                        including the mudrās and mantras of all the maṇḍala deities. This sādhana is
                        the only one in the tantra that employs the stages of deity yoga practice
                        typical of the Yoga Tantras, including the different stages of
                        visualization, meditating on emptiness, generating oneself as the pledge
                        being (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samayasattva</foreign>),
                        donning the armor, and merging the pledge being with the wisdom being
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jñānasattva</foreign>). To
                        conclude the section on the sādhana of Bhūtaḍāmara, the text explains its
                        benefits: “by merely reciting the mantra of Vajradhara one will become equal
                        to him. Should one fail in this, one will become a universal monarch of the
                        four continents. If one merely utters the name of the glorious Vajradhara,
                        the supreme master Great Wrath, all the spirits will become one’s servants.”
                        The text then sets the rules and requirements for the preliminary practice,
                        a practice sequence of prescribed duration that constitutes the necessary
                        prelude before one can undertake a practice with a specific aim that varies
                        according to the practitioner’s wish. </p>

                        Kriyā Tantra-style sādhanas designed to gain control over worldly divinities
                        and spirits. The implication could be that Kriyā Tantra sādhanas are to be
                        employed with the goal of subjugating such spirits only after the
                        practitioner has mastered the main practice of Bhūtaḍāmara that employs the
                        stages of Yoga Tantra sādhana. The Kriyā Tantra sādhanas in this section all
                        involve the use of effigies of the deities or spirits whom one is inducting
                        into a bonded relationship (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">samaya</foreign>) with oneself. The females

                        before the sādhanas of powerful worldly gods, including Mahādeva-Śiva,
                        Viṣṇu, and Brahmā. Together, these deities form a formidable array of allies
                        who can protect and help the practitioner in many different ways.</p>

                        Bhūtaḍāmara, including a detailed description of its many deities. Although
                        this maṇḍala, its iconography, and its initiation ritual resemble those
                        found in the Yoga Tantras, the sequence of deity yoga practice common to the
                        Yoga Tantras is not included here as it was in the previous Bhūtaḍāmara
                        maṇḍala. Instead, the text quickly moves on to sādhanas and rituals
                        dedicated to individual spirits who, as before, come in groups of eight.
                        These sādhanas, like all spirit sādhanas in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>, demonstrate a strictly Kriyā Tantra
                        character. In this section, the sets of deities differ from those presented
                        in the previous Bhūtaḍāmara sādhana, including the addition of new groups.
                        The first among them are the sādhanas of the eight bhūtas headed by
                        Aparājita. Each of their sādhanas is followed by a description of their
                        mudrās, separated by a very short chapter which sums up their practice. Two
                        sādhanas dedicated to bhūtinīs are presented next, followed by instructions

                    <p tid="36">The Tibetan version ends at this point, which was in all likelihood the end
                        of the Sanskrit version from which the Tibetan translators worked. The
                        extant Sanskrit sources, however, includes additional mantras and mudrās
                        associated with the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bali</foreign>
                        ritual and, rather syncretically, lists the eighteen types of emptiness. The
                        Sanskrit version finishes by repeating the names of the eight
                        bhūtas—Aparājita and so forth—possibly suggesting that these eight are the
                        most important ones referred to by the element <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> in the name of Bhūtaḍāmara. The last of the
                        bhūtas has the name Kiṃkarottama (“Best Servant”), giving expression, as it
                        were, to the ethos of mastery over spirits as found in this tantra. Looking
                        at these final additions to the Sanskrit version through the eyes of a
                        philologist, they could perhaps provide clues to the type of changes that
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara</title> must have undergone before
                        it reached the form available to us today, and possibly even before it was

                        sources differ from one another, either due to variant readings, through
                        omission or addition, or based on differences in sequence, the translation
                        follows, with only a few exceptions, the Sanskrit source that most closely
                        agrees with the Tibetan translation. In some cases we have elected to
                        privilege the Tibetan translation over all Sanskrit sources when it provided
                        the most adequate reading. More information on these sources is given in the
                        introduction that accompanies our edition of the Sanskrit text of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>.</p>

                    <p tid="39">In the present translation the reader may find some expressions and phrases
                        that sound odd in English, but nevertheless reflect certain ideas or
                        principles that are conveyed more accurately if phrased as they are in the
                        original Sanskrit. Phrases such as “reciting the Great Wrath,” “reciters of
                        the Vajrapāṇi,” or “anyone who recites one of the tathāgatas,” refer to
                        reciting the respective mantras and reflect the notion that the name of the
                        deity is also the name of its mantra. This notion seems ubiquitous
                        throughout the tantras (not only Buddhist) and is frequently explained in
                        the Kriyā Tantras. Another oddity is the use of the English “to incant” in
                        the sense of reciting the mantra over an object in order to invest it with a
                        magical power; one may, for example, incant a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bali</foreign>, or incant sandalwood a certain number of

                        shortcoming concerns the translation of the descriptions of mudrā
                        gestures—it is just as basic as the original Sanskrit, and therefore
                        inadequate for those not already familiar with the gestures being
                        described.</p>

                    <p tid="41">There is a Śaiva version of the tantra that was produced between the eleventh
                        and fifteenth centuries (Pal 1981, p. 32, n. 8). Just as in the Buddhist
                        version, the teaching is delivered by the Buddha Vajrapāṇi who speaks in the
                        first person. The discourse, however, is introduced by Unmattabhairava in
                        response to a question by Unmattabhairavī (the wrathful aspects of Śiva and
                        Pārvatī respectively). The hierarchy of deities remains unchanged, with
                        Vajrapāṇi Bhūtaḍāmara still enjoying the same status as in the Buddhist
                        version. This perhaps could be attributed to the fact that, unlike in other
                        early Buddhist tantras that describe the “subjugation of Śiva,” no
                        confrontation is involved here; Śiva is never forced into submission.
                        Overwhelmed by the power that Vajrapāṇi displays when killing and then
                        reviving all worldly beings, which he experiences first-hand, he asks
                        Vajrapāṇi for protection. It is noteworthy that on one occasion in this
                        version of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhūtaḍāmara Tantra</title>, Śiva is
                        referred to as a “bodhisattva” (Bhattacharyya 1933, p. 366). Consulting the
                        Śaiva version of the tantra might have helped clear up some ambiguities, but
                        unfortunately we were unable to gain access to the manuscripts. </p>
