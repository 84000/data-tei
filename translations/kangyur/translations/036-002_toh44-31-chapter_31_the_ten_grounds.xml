                                                <title xml:lang="en">The Ten Bhūmis</title> takes place two weeks after his enlightenment, while he is
                                        sitting silently in meditation in the central palace in the highest paradise of the desire realm. Countless
                                        bodhisattvas have assembled there. Through the power of the Buddha, the bodhisattva Vajra­garbha enters
                                        samādhi and is blessed by countless buddhas, also named Vajra­garbha, to give a Dharma teaching to the
                                        bodhisattvas. In response to the questions of the bodhisattva Vimukti­candra, Vajra­garbha describes
                                        successively the ten bhūmis of a bodhisattva. Countless bodhisattvas arrive and report that this same event is
                                        occurring simultaneously in the highest paradises of all other worlds. The Buddha is pleased by Vajra­garbha’s
                                        teaching.</p>

                                                to Tibet only after King Ralpachen came to the throne. Therefore, this translation was made sometime

                                                was presumably translated into Tibetan at some time following the translation of the sūtra. The

                                                though Yeshé Dé was involved in translating both the sūtra and the commentary, the translation in the
                                                commentary is of a better quality than that in the Kangyur, which does not appear to have been revised
                                                in the light of the translation of the commentary. There are some passages in the translation of the
                                                commentary that repeat the Kangyur version word for word, but the majority of the translation differs
                                                and is more accurate. The witness of the Sanskrit manuscripts, together with the contents of the
                                                Chinese translation, verify that the version in the translation of the commentary is more accurate and
                                                preserves certain phrases, or sometimes even entire sentences, that are missing in the Kangyur
                                                version, either as a result of omissions in a Sanskrit manuscript that was used as a source or through
                                                errors made during the centuries when the translation was preserved only in handwritten copies. This translation
                                                into English has been made by generally favoring the version translated within the commentary, with

                                                of the commentary was Prajñāvarman. He was a Bengali who had come to Tibet during Trisong Detsen’s

                                                that were translated into Tibetan and are contained in the Tengyur. The co-translator Mañjuśrī­garbha
                                                is a lesser-known figure; he is recorded as being involved in only three translations, two of which

                                                        describes the ten attainments through which a bodhisattva attains the tenth bhūmi, Cloud of
                                                        Dharma. A bodhisattva on the tenth bhūmi enters millions of samādhis, concluding with the
                                                        samādhi called <distinct>the unique consecration for omniscient wisdom</distinct>. At that
                                                        moment there appears a precious lotus the size of a million billion-world universes. The
                                                        bodhisattva has a proportionally vast body and is seated upon that lotus. Other bodhisattvas
                                                        seated upon lotuses encircle him, gazing at him. Light rays radiate from various parts of his
                                                        body, which manifest the Dharma in various realms and bring an end to suffering. Light rays
                                                        from the top of his head honor and make offerings to buddhas and bodhisattvas in all worlds.
                                                        All bodhisattvas from the first to the ninth bhūmi come to this bodhisattva and make offerings
                                                        to him. Light rays from the heart region of all those bodhisattvas enter the bodhisattva’s
                                                        heart. Light rays from the ūrṇā hairs of all buddhas enter the bodhisattva’s head. As a result
                                                        of this consecration his ten strengths become complete, and he is numbered among the
                                                        samyak­sambuddhas. This is compared to the consecration of a crown prince who becomes a
