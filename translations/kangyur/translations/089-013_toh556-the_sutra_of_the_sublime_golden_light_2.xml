                    <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Sublime Golden Light</title> has held great importance in Buddhism for its
                    instructions on the purification of karma. In particular, much of the sūtra is specifically addressed to monarchs and thus has
                    been significant for rulers—not only in India but also in China, Japan, Mongolia, and elsewhere—who wished to ensure the
                    well-being of their nations through such purification. Reciting and internalizing this sūtra is understood to be efficacious for
                    personal purification and also for the welfare of a state and the world.</p>

                <p tid="3">In this sūtra, the bodhisattva Ruciraketu has a dream in which a prayer of confession emanates from a shining golden drum.
                    He relates the prayer to the Buddha, and a number of deities then vow to protect it and its adherents. The ruler’s devotion to the
                    sūtra is emphasized as important if the nation is to benefit. Toward the end of the sūtra are two well-known narratives of the
                    Buddha’s previous lives: the account of the physician Jalavāhana, who saves and blesses numerous fish, and that of Prince
                    Mahāsattva, who gives his body to a hungry tigress and her cubs.</p>

                        instructions on the purification of karma. In particular, much of the sūtra is specifically addressed to monarchs, and thus it
                        has been significant for rulers—not only in India but also in China, Japan, Mongolia, and elsewhere—who wished to ensure the
                        well-being of their nations. It is understood to be efficacious for personal purification and beneficial for the welfare of a

                        he sees a brightly shining golden drum. When a brahmin beats the drum, Ruciraketu hears in the drumbeats a hundred-verse
                        prayer, and he subsequently recites that prayer to the Buddha.</p>

                    <p tid="13">Most of the following chapters are concerned with encouraging the recitation of this prayer and of the sūtra itself.
                        They describe how various divine beings in this world revere the sūtra and promise to protect it and its adherents. These
                        include the Four Mahārājas; Dṛḍhā, who is the goddess of the earth; Sarasvatī, the goddess of wisdom, learning, and music;
                        Śrī, the goddess of good fortune; and the yakṣa general Saṃjñeya. </p>

                        for its recitation and teaching, then their reign and their kingdom will prosper. They will avoid such calamities as invasion,
                        famine, and so on. The sūtra also warns that if they fail to show such devotion, there will be disastrous results for both
                        them and their kingdoms. Chapter 20 is dedicated to the subject of how to be a good king.</p>

                    <p tid="15">There are also chapters that deal with doctrine. Chapter 2 presents the view that a buddha never dies and so never
                        passes into nirvāṇa. Therefore, there is no body and no physical relics of his body after his cremation, and so the Dharma
                        never ceases to be taught. The passing of a buddha and the extinction of the Dharma are solely illusory manifestations,
                        skillful methods to inspire beings to practice and to provide them with relics as objects for their devotion. The longer
                        versions of the sūtra also contain chapter 3 (not present in Toh 557), which describes the nature of the three bodies, and
                        chapter 6, which describes the ten bodhisattva bhūmis (also not present in Toh 557). Chapters 9 and 10 teach the view of
                        emptiness. </p>

                    <p tid="16">Toward the end, there are two narratives that describe previous lives of the Buddha. Chapters 24 and 25 describe the
                        physician Jalavāhana, who, as a result of performing Dharma recitations while standing in a lake, ensured the rebirth of ten
                        thousand fish into the paradise of Trāyastriṃśa. In the preceding chapter, these same ten thousand devas receive the prophecy
                        of their buddhahood. When the goddess of the Bodhi tree objects that they have not accomplished the necessary bodhisattva
                        conduct in past lives to receive such a prophecy, the Buddha explains that this was unnecessary because they had devotion to

                    <p tid="17">The other past-life narrative, which is given in chapter 26, is one of the most famous in Buddhist literature—that of
                        the prince who gives his body to a hungry tigress and her cubs. An interesting feature of the story in this sūtra is that much
                        of the narrative is dedicated to an evocative description of the intense grief of parents who have lost their child,
                        emphasizing the sorrow that the prince’s action has brought them.</p>

                        a tantra, specifically as a Kriyā tantra, a class of tantras in which there is an emphasis on external ritual. The sūtra
                        contains a description of how such rituals should be performed, and there are also passages that include lists of ingredients
                        to place in a bath, along with mantras to recite while bathing, in order to achieve purification. Toh 556 and Toh 555 also
                        supply a number of dhāraṇīs to be recited in order to gain specific results. </p>

                    <p tid="20">One can also see that the seed of the later maṇḍalas of the five buddha families is in this sūtra, for in chapters 2
                        and 3, buddhas of the four directions appear to a layman who has a visionary dream. They include Akṣobhya from the east and
                        Amitābha from the west, both buddhas and their realms already established in the Buddhist tradition with specific sūtras
                        dedicated to them. There also appear the buddhas Ratnaketu from the south and Dundubhisvara from the north, who in later
                        tantras are usually named Ratnasaṃbhava and Amoghasiddhi. In this sūtra, the central buddha in terms of these directions would
                        be Śākyamuni himself. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">

                        first in Dunhuang. Then in 420 he went to Guzang, the capital of Northern Liang, one of the sixteen independent states of that

                        the patronage of Juqu Mengxun (368–433), the ruler of Northern Liang. He also had the reputation of being “a master of
                        spells.” As a result of that reputation, Juqu Mengxun, toward the end of his reign, became afraid that Dharmakṣema might be

                        from the effects of bad karma. For example, Yijing’s Chinese translation (and the Uighur and Tangut versions derived from it)
                        has a preface that states how the sūtra saved Zhang Judao, ruler of Tangut, from going to hell because he had slaughtered

                            introduction and conclusion, of <title xml:lang="en">Putting an End to Karmic Obscurations</title> (Toh 219). Light rays
                            radiate from the Buddha, bringing happiness to all beings in the lower existences. On seeing that light, Śakra and other
                            deities come to the Buddha. When the deities are gathered, the Buddha’s principal human disciple, Śāriputra, asks the
                            Buddha how to confess their previous bad actions. The Buddha gives a recitation that should be done three times over the
                            course of the day and three times at night in order for the deities to free themselves of karmic obscuration and to attain
                            whatever is aspired to—from rebirth in a good human family or various paradises to the attainment of ultimate wisdom. The
                            Buddha explains that they should also recite the words of rejoicing in the good actions of others, requesting the buddhas
                            in all worlds to teach the Dharma, and requesting them to not pass away. The Buddha states that this creates greater merit
                            than any other kind of Dharma practice and that they should recite a dedication of their merit to the enlightenment of all
                            beings.</p>

                            woman named Gaṅgadevī who received this very teaching from Great Mass of Light. Through her dedication to it, she was
                            subsequently always reborn as a man until she became a buddha by the name of Ratnārci. Ratnārci teaches in a realm a vast
                            distance away in the east, in the present time. Any woman who hears the name of this buddha will no longer be reborn as a

                            necessities to fall on the four continents he ruled, and he made an offering of it all to the Three Jewels. Śākyamuni
                            states that he was Susaṃbhava at that time, and that Ratnoccaya became the Buddha Akṣobhya. He states that it is through

                            his previous lives, and it was through the sacrifice of his life that he was able to attain buddhahood. He relates that in
                            the past, King Mahāratha had three sons, Mahāpraṇāda, Mahādeva, and Mahāsattva. The three princes wandered into a forest

                            later and turned back. He then cut his throat in front of the tigress and fell before her. The other two princes searched
                            for their younger brother and discovered he had been eaten. The queen had nightmares and was distressed, thinking that
                            something had happened to her sons. Therefore, the king and queen went in search of their sons and found the two princes,
                            who told them of Mahāsattva’s death. In great distress, they went to his remains and placed them in the stūpa. The Buddha
                            states that he was Mahāsattva. The story is then retold in verse, in which it is also stated that the Buddha’s father,
                            Śuddhodana, was the king; his mother, Māya, was the queen; the two other princes were Maitreya and Mañjuśrī; the tigress

                            the brahmin’s proper name and treat the rest of the phrase as descriptive, reading “The brahmin named Kauṇḍinya who was

Though not considered a creator god in Buddhism, Brahmā occupies an important place as one of two gods (the other being Indra/Śakra) said to have first exhorted the Buddha Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma. The particular heavens found in the form realm over which Brahmā rules are often some of the most sought-after realms of higher rebirth in Buddhist literature. Since there are many universes or world systems, there are also multiple Brahmās presiding over them. His most frequent epithets are “Lord of the Sahā World” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sahāṃpati</foreign>) and Great Brahmā (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābrahmā</foreign>).</p>

                                <p>This term has various meanings according to context. Here in this sūtra it is used to refer to
                                    the four meditative states associated with the formless realm: (1) infinite space, (2) infinite consciousness, (3)
                                    nothingness, and (4) neither perception nor nonperception. In the context of epistemology, it is one way of
                                    describing experience and the world in terms of twelve sense sources, which can be divided into inner and outer
                                    sense sources, namely: (1–2) eye and form, (3–4) ear and sound, (5–6) nose and odor, (7–8) tongue and taste,
                                    (9–10) body and touch, (11–12) mind and mental phenomena. In the context of the twelve links of dependent
                                    origination, only six sense sources are mentioned, and they are the inner sense sources (identical to the six
                                    faculties) of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.</p>

                                <p>“Circular Enclosure”; there are at least three interpretations of what this name refers to. In

                                    equivalent to the Vaḍaba submarine mountain of fire, also said to be the entrance to the hells. More commonly, it
                                    is the name of the outer ring of mountains at the edge of the flat disk that is the world, with Sumeru in the
                                    center. This is also equated with Vaḍaba, as it is the heat of the mountain range that evaporates the ocean so
                                    that it does not overflow. Jambudvīpa, the world of humans, is in this sea to Sumeru’s south. However, the term is
                                    also used to mean the entire disk, including Meru and the paradises above it. An alternate form is

                                <p>Indian Buddhist name for either the four-continent world in which the Buddha Śākyamuni
                                    appeared, or a universe of a thousand million such worlds. The name Sahā possibly derives from the Sanskrit
                                        √<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sah</foreign>, “to bear, endure, or withstand.” It is often
                                    interpreted as alluding to the inhabitants of this world having to endure suffering. The Tibetan translation,
                                        <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mi mjed</foreign>, follows along the same lines. It literally means
                                    “not unbearable,” in the sense that beings here are able to bear the suffering they experience. </p>

At its summit lies Sudarśana, home of Śakra and his thirty-two gods, and on its flanks live the asuras. The mount has four sides facing the cardinal directions, each of which is made of a different precious stone. Surrounding it are several mountain ranges and the great ocean where the four great island continents lie: in the south, Jambudvīpa (our world); in the west, Godānīya; in the north, Uttarakuru; in the east, Pūrvavideha. Above it are the abodes of the gods of the realm of desire. Often also referred to as Mount Meru.</p>
