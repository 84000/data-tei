                    with Nanda asking the Buddha why beings living in this world experience different ranges of
                    conditions. This leads the Buddha to explain how all experiences are brought about by the ripening
                    of a variety of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions. The results of nonvirtuous actions are detailed
                    first, prompting Nanda to ask about people, such as benefactors, who, conversely, are committed to
                    performing virtuous actions. The Buddha’s discourse then details the workings of karma by making use
                    of a plethora of examples before concluding with a description of virtuous actions and the benefits
                    they bring.</p>

                        Actions</title>, Nanda asks the Buddha why different beings experience different fortunes and
                        what types of past actions have now ripened into their respective conditions. The Buddha answers
                        this question by elucidating the inconceivable dynamics of karma through a series of examples of
                        virtuous and nonvirtuous actions along with their positive and negative results. While these
                        one-to-one correspondences might strike the reader as an oversimplification of a very subtle and
                        complex process, such pedagogical devices are common in the Buddhist tradition. Notably, in the classical
                        presentation of the three types of karmic results (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">las kyi ’bras bu gsum</foreign>), the second is said to be the “correlated effect” (Tib.
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rgyu mthun pa’i ’bras bu</foreign>), which describes
                        how results mirror their causes. </p>

                            Nonvirtuous Actions</title> is a translation of the Chinese sūtra titled <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Shanwo yinguo jing</title>
                        <title xml:lang="zh">善惡因果經</title> (Taishō 2881). One thing that is particularly intriguing
                        about this Tibetan sūtra is that it is practically identical to another Tibetan translation,
                            <title xml:lang="en">Teaching the Causes and Results of Good and Ill</title> (Toh
                        354)<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh354"/>. Upon comparison, it is clear that these two Tibetan texts are
                        simply different translations of the same Chinese sūtra. However, perhaps solely on account of
                        their dissimilar titles, they are retained as two distinct yet adjacent entries in the Degé
                        Kangyur.</p>

                    <p tid="10">The principal difference between these two sūtras is that Toh 355, translated here,
                        employs a Sino-Tibetan lexicon whereas Toh 354 uses an Indo-Tibetan lexicon.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-009-7"> See Stein 2010.</note> These two lexicons refer respectively to
                        the indigenous and presumably more archaic range of Tibetan terminology used to translate
                        Chinese texts, whether they be Buddhist or otherwise, and the range of terminology that was
                        constructed in the likeness of Sanskrit and implemented during the early ninth century in order
                        to imbue translations with a more Indic flavor. This
                        may suggest that Toh 355 is the older of the two translations, since the dominance of Indian
                        Buddhism came at a later point in the Tibetan imperial period.</p>

                        that Chödrup is known for his use of Indian vocabulary, it is quite certain that he did not also
                        translate Toh 355.</p>

                        this translation corresponds more closely to Toh 354, it nevertheless helped clarify several
                        passages in Toh 355. The present English translation was produced based on the Degé block print with

                                <p>Literally, “without leisure.” This refers to being born in a state in which one will not have the opportunity to meet with a buddha or their teachings. Eight situations are typically listed: (1) being born in a hell realm, (2) as an animal, (3) as a hungry ghost, (4) as a long-life god, (5) in a borderland or non-Buddhist country, (6) having wrong views, (7) as someone with impaired faculties who is unable to understand the teachings, or (8) in a time or place where no buddha has come.</p>

                                <p>In the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">paṇḍaka</foreign> encompasses diverse physiological and behavioral
                                conditions, such as intersexuality, erectile dysfunction, and fetishes that imply an
                                inability to engage in normative sexual behavior. The criteria for being designated a
                                paṇḍaka are not strictly physiological, but neither are they grounded exclusively in
                                gender identity or sexual orientation. Paṇḍaka is, in effect, a catchall category and,
                                as such, defies easy translations like “neuter,” “androgyne,” “intersexual,”
                                “transgender,” or “paraphiliac.”</p>
