                    <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of the Armor Array</title> takes place in Veṇuvana, the famous “Bamboo Grove” monastery on
                    the outskirts of the ancient city of Rājagṛha, where Buddha Śākyamuni and his community of monks took up residence
                    during several rainy season retreats. This grove was offered to the Buddha by Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, and it is
                    a location where the Buddha is said to have taught numerous discourses. As is customary in sūtra literature, the Buddha
                    delivers his Dharma teaching at the request of someone who poses a particular question. In this sūtra, the questioner is
                    a bodhisattva named Anantamati, who asks the Buddha numerous questions about the Great Vehicle path, most notably about
                    a type of metaphorical armor called <distinct>the great armor</distinct>. In his reply, the Buddha explains that donning
                    the great armor has two dimensions: (1) a constant diligence in bodhisattva conduct in service to beings over countless
                    eons, and (2) the relinquishment of any forms of objective fixation upon or apprehension of phenomena. As such, the
                    great armor has both relative and ultimate aspects, a fact that various Tibetan commentators have also highlighted.
                    Still, the great armor is primarily described as signless, formless, nonconceptual, and indescribable. It is precisely
                    by virtue of not apprehending phenomena, the Buddha explains, that the great armor is able to shield its bearer. Given
                    that it lies outside the limitations of conditioned existence, it offers protection from all conditioned forms of harm.
                    Nevertheless, to describe its protective power, the Buddha draws significantly on various military analogies. </p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-040-002-7"/>
                <p tid="11">Apart from the great armor, the sūtra also discusses the Great Vehicle and what it terms the <distinct>great path</distinct>.
                    The Buddha emphasizes that the Great Vehicle can accommodate all beings easily due to its absolute nature, which accords
                    with the realm of phenomena. As for the great path, it is likewise due to the absence of any apprehension of phenomena
                    that it can be traversed. Thus, as with the great armor, the ultimate nature of the Great Vehicle and the great path is
                    emphasized. It is precisely because of their relationship to the ultimate truth, namely that they rely and depend on
                    nothing, that they can accommodate and transport all beings on the relative plane. To illustrate the value of the great
                    armor, the Great Vehicle, and the great path, the Buddha recalls a past eon in which a universal monarch named
                    Sarvārthasiddha renounced his kingdom to receive and accomplish these teachings. The sūtra concludes with the Buddha
                    describing in detail how bodhisattvas should be free from conceptual activity to carry out unlimited conduct. He
                    explains that only by observing nothing and relying on nothing will bodhisattvas be in accord with the realm of
                    phenomena, and thus don the great armor.</p>

                        Jewels</title> are extant in Sanskrit, and this scripture is not one of them. The Tibetan translation, which we
                    have rendered into English here, was completed in the early translation period and is listed in the early ninth-century

                    the time, this text was translated from Chinese, rather than Sanskrit. While the Degé edition of the Kangyur does not
                    specify a translator, the Narthang edition states that it was translated from the Chinese by Gö Chödrup (ca. 755–849),
                    who was a prolific Sino-Tibetan translator active in the Dunhuang region during the ninth century. Besides rendering
                    <title xml:lang="en">The Armor Array</title> into Tibetan, he also translated many other sūtras and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇīs</foreign> from Chinese. The Chinese canon contains only one translation
                    of <title xml:lang="en">The Armor Array</title> (<title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Bei jia zhuangyan hui</title>, <title xml:lang="zh">被甲莊嚴會</title>, Taishō 310 [7]), constituting the seventh text in the full Chinese translation of the <title xml:lang="en">Heap of Jewels</title>, which was produced during the early eighth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> by Bodhiruci (d. 727), a renowned translator from South India (who is not to be confused with another
                    famous Indian translator of the same name who was active in China two centuries earlier). This Bodhiruci is responsible
                    for translating much of the <title xml:lang="en">Heap of Jewels</title> collection, among other texts, into

                        translation that follows the Chinese very closely. Thus, comparison with the Chinese text made it possible to
                        identify several scribal errors and translation inaccuracies in the Tibetan translation, which we then revised
                        in the translation according to the Chinese.</note>

                                        his great community of monks and bodhisattva great beings, all of whom had gathered from myriad buddha fields. This
                                        immeasurably large assembly had gathered around the Blessed One and was respectfully serving and honoring him. Among
                                        those included in the assembly at that time was a bodhisattva great being named Anantamati. He rose from his seat, bared
                                        his right shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said,
                                        “Blessed One, I have a few doubts. If I were to ask the Thus-Gone One some questions, would he be so kind as to teach
                                        me?”</p>

                                <p tid="128">“When bodhisattva great beings have donned the great armor in this fashion, then, by not abandoning the armor, they develop
                                        great diligence and are capable of entering into all the realms of sentient beings. Abiding stably in patience, they
                                        abandon fear; and without fear, anxiety, wavering, or disturbance, they again don the boundless armor. This armor is an
                                        armor that protects all beings, an armor that cuts through the thicket of all views, an armor that defeats the forces of
                                        Māra, an armor that embraces insight, an armor that is a boundless bridge, an armor that liberates from heavy burdens,
                                        an armor that develops pure faith, an armor that observes discipline, an armor that purifies the storehouse of action,
                                        an armor that is a powerful treasury that purifies everything, an armor that is a treasury of skillful means, an armor
                                        that eliminates all clinging, and an armor of irreversible, irreproachable insight. Bodhisattva great beings who have
                                        donned such great armor, and who do not abandon it until the end of saṃsāra has been reached, will never waver from the
                                        stability of their strong diligence as they proceed toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”</p>

                                        armor is donned in some place, or that armor is donned from somewhere. They do not see that there is a self capable of
                                        donning armor, nor do they see an armor that is donned by a self. They also do not see that armor is donned in this
                                        place, or that armor is donned in that place. They also do not see any sentient beings for whose sake such armor is

                                        not apprehend a mind. Therefore, since they do not apprehend, they have abandoned all concepts. If any bodhisattva great
                                        being were to dwell on even the smallest phenomenon or apprehend even the smallest phenomenon, they could not be said to
                                        have donned the armor, to don the armor, or to be donning the armor. However, once they transcend those mind states, it
                                        can be said that they have donned the great and inconceivable armor.</p>

                                        countless billions of buddhas, which caused me great joy. When cultivating this Dharma, I served and venerated those
                                        blessed buddhas, and I did not produce such thoughts as, ‘I am donning such an armor. I possess such an armor. I have

                                        Thus, it involves neither the slightest conditioned thing, nor the slightest unconditioned thing. Because it has already
                                        extinguished conditioned things and abandoned unconditioned things, it does not provide beings with either conditioned
                                        or unconditioned happiness whatsoever. </p>

                                <p tid="278">“Anantamati, many beings desire a conditioned nirvāṇa; they do not even seek conditioned happiness, so how could they be able
                                        to enter this great palace? Because this great palace is unconditioned, cool, and quiescent, it is called
                                                <distinct>nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering</distinct>. Because it stops attachment, aggression, and
                                        ignorance, removes latent tendencies, rends the web of worldly views, dries up the river of ignorance, extracts the
                                        poisoned arrows of the afflictions, and exhausts nonvirtuous phenomena, it is called <distinct>nirvāṇa—the transcendence
                                                of suffering</distinct>. Since it is far removed from the disease of pride and all the afflictions caused by
                                        much suffering, it is called <distinct>nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering</distinct>. Because it is not of the
                                        domain of the mind, the intellect, consciousness, or mental functions, it is called <distinct>nirvāṇa—the transcendence
                                                of suffering</distinct>. Since it pacifies all debates and all ties to existence, all the way up to the
                                        perception of Dharma, it is called <distinct>nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering</distinct>. Since it cuts through
                                        mental inclinations and the striving they engender, and because it is free from the marks of conceptualization and its
                                        objects, it is called <distinct>nirvāṇa—the transcendence of suffering</distinct>.</p>

                                <p tid="279">“Anantamati, this is the very essence of great nirvāṇa, the supreme transcendence. Since nirvāṇa is boundless, it cannot be
                                        described. If it entailed any destination, it could not be this path, since this path is beyond words and thus also
                                        indescribable. Given that bodhisattva great beings travel on this path toward the great palace of nirvāṇa, they can
                                        establish countless beings on it. <ref cRef="F.89.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-002-934"/> Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings proceed on this path, they do not
                                        become tired, and they do not become distressed. According to what they wish to seek, they manifest at will. According
                                        to where they intend to manifest, they manifest in each place, and each manifestation accordingly attracts beings and
                                        teaches them the Dharma, causing all beings to attain great joy. Why is this? Because this path is unequalled, it
                                        purifies all discordant factors and brings all activities to completion. Thus, all the blessed buddhas, hearers, and
                                        solitary buddhas all proceed on this path and do not contravene it. As long as they have not reached that ground, and as
                                        long as they have not fulfilled their aspirations, they never depart from it. What is that ground? It is the ground of
                                        nirvāṇa, the ground of the great palace. To draw an analogy, since nothing can illustrate space, there is no other
                                        example besides space itself to illustrate space. Thus, to this vast, great, empty void, we apply the label
                                                <distinct>space</distinct>. The palace of nirvāṇa is similar. It is a great, empty void, in which there is no
                                        autonomous self and nothing pertaining to self. Therefore, even if all beings enter it, there is not even a single
                                        hair’s worth of anything to grasp on to. It is an open and vast emptiness, an utter void that is immeasurably vast.
                                        Therefore, it is called <distinct>great nirvāṇa</distinct> and <distinct>the great palace</distinct>.</p>

                                        solitary buddhas can attain. Those who abide on this path accomplish all the accumulations of merit and obtain
                                        irreversibility. Thereby, they enact great benefit for beings. Manifesting a great array of extraordinarily noble

                                        buddhas can possess. While bodhisattva great beings are abiding on this path, even if they act as universal monarchs,
                                        they will have no ownership of anything. With great power, they will perform miracles and gain realization of both the
                                        world and what is beyond the world. Even if they act as divine rulers such as Śakra and Brahmā, they will be free from
                                        attachment and clinging. As such, they will abandon pride and aspire to encounter buddhas, delight in hearing the true
                                        Dharma, ripen countless thousands of gods, and endeavor toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening.”</p>

                                        path through these Dharma practices. Because they see that the essential nature of phenomena is empty, nameless,
                                        markless, wishless, unborn, unconditioned, and characterized by disenchantment, abandonment, cessation, and liberation,
                                        therefore they achieve the illumination of Dharma. Even when they contemplate the termination of births, they do not
                                        arouse any notion of birth with regard to birthlessness. Thus, at that time they transcend all births, and so they pass
                                        beyond all that is contrary to the Dharma. As they achieve the pure path, they gain the acceptance that phenomena are
                                        unborn. Because they have purified the path, they transcend all perception, and subsequently they do not abide in
                                        nonperception either. Stopping the perception of the path, they abandon the perception of phenomena and escape from the
                                        web of unknowing. By cultivating knowing, they obtain those phenomena that are to be achieved. </p>

                                        reality by following the secret teachings. When bodhisattva great beings follow this path, they do not dwell on objects,
                                        and marks do not obscure them. Thereby understanding that all phenomena are the same as space, that their arising is the
                                        same as the arising of space, and that their essential nature is the same as the essential nature of space, they are not

                                        don the great armor, they are not bound by grasping. Because they mount the Great Vehicle, they are not deluded. Because
                                        they abandon obscurations, they become like space. Proceeding on this path, they will become great lights for beings.
                                        Anantamati, this is the extraordinarily noble path of the bodhisattva great beings, which is not the domain of hearers

                                        proceed upon it. Anantamati, even if one has insight, if one is not guided by such insight, one will not proceed
                                        properly on this path. If one possesses insight and is guided by insight, then one will engage with and follow this
                                        insight, as it pervades everywhere. One will gather through insight, and will exercise restraint through insight. From
                                        that point onward, one can be said to have donned the great armor, to have mounted the Great Vehicle, and to abide on
                                        the great path. With the delightful Dharma, one will then benefit worldly beings and open the eye of insight. As one
                                        investigates with the eye of insight, one’s insight body will shine forth, emitting a great illumination, and one will
                                        proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening. </p>

                                <p tid="385">“Anantamati, such is the great armor and the array of armor that bodhisattva great beings must don. <ref cRef="F.96.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-002-948"/> Such is the
                                        Great Vehicle and the array of the Great Vehicle that they must mount. Such is the great path and the array of the great
                                        path that they must traverse, in order to proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete awakening. Anantamati, even
                                        if I spoke for countless eons about the sublime beings who possess the armor array, the Great Vehicle array, the great
                                        path array, and the various arrays of all good qualities, that would not be long enough. However, so that all of you may
                                        realize it, and so that sublime beings of the future may achieve the armor array, the Great Vehicle array, the great
                                        path array, and the array of the boundless assembly of qualities, I have briefly described it on this occasion. If such
                                        sublime beings hear the Dharma I have taught here, they will don the great armor, mount the Great Vehicle, abide on the
                                        great path, adorn themselves with good qualities, and proceed in this way.”</p>

                                        Great Vehicle cannot be designated in even the slightest. If designations are made, this is nondesignation, because such
                                        designations cannot be apprehended and cannot be seen. There is also no vehicle that can be mounted and dwelt upon; it
                                        is through nonapprehension that one abides on the Great Vehicle. Because it abandons proceeding toward a destination,
                                        does not reach the ultimate goal, does not arrive at nirvāṇa, and cannot be apprehended, what is not a path is taken as
                                        a path. Because one proceeds on the path through sameness, this path of sameness has no designations, for who would make
                                        such designations? What would be designated? From where would designations be made? In it there is also no action and no
                                        actor. It is not combined, and it is not uncombined. It renounces everything and does not seek anything. Why is this?
                                        Because this true path of sameness is not the same as all phenomena, nor is it different from them, nor concurrent with
                                        them. It does not produce notions of phenomena—indeed, it abandons phenomena. Therefore, it is neither pure nor impure.
                                        The nature of phenomena is also this way—neither pure nor impure. Thus, for this reason this path is called
                                                <distinct>the path without affliction</distinct>. Because it cannot be traversed, it is traversed. Because it
                                        cannot be taken hold of, it is taken up. This path is deeply profound, and therefore it is unborn, unarisen, unemerged,
                                        uncreated, unattained, unconditioned, nondwelling, non-abiding, unobscured, and without entity. It can completely reveal
                                        all entities, and is indivisible from all entities, yet it does not conform to entities. Because it has no entity, it
                                        leads to the unsurpassed abode. </p>

                                        supremely pleasant, with nothing left to pursue, and because all pursuits have been permanently pacified and

                                        marks or marklessness. They do not see the absence of marks as an absence of marks. They do not see the existence of
                                        marks as the existence of marks. They do not form a view of the existence of marks, nor do they form a view of the
                                        absence of marks. The same is true for the absence of birth and the absence of action. As for exhaustion, they do not

                                        absence of exhaustion. When bodhisattva great beings regard things in this way, they do not apprehend even the slightest

                                        without either the slightest form of practice or the most superior practice; they do not pursue practice, and they do
                                        not engage in pervasive practice, and thus they are able to obtain the boundless great illumination of Dharma. If
                                        bodhisattva great beings themselves cannot be apprehended or seen, there is no need to mention that no bodhisattva
                                        conduct can be apprehended or seen. How would it be possible to see the many eons of practice through which the
                                        boundless great illumination of Dharma is attained? Because bodhisattva great beings pacify all conduct and purify their
                                        conduct, they achieve the illumination of Dharma. The conduct of the illumination of Dharma is not a conduct that can be
                                        reckoned, nor is it a conduct that follows after marks. From where could any designation of all forms of conduct be
                                        made? Thus, that which is practiced is not a conduct that can be designated, nor is it free from designations. Noble
                                        Intellect, when bodhisattva great beings abide in this conduct, they abandon all forms of conduct, and thereby do not
                                        grasp at anything. Those who fully possess this conduct do not engage in conduct that can be reckoned, or conduct that
                                        follows after marks. It is with no marks and no conduct that they are able to obtain this great illumination of
                                        Dharma.”</p>

                                <p tid="674">The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Boundless Victor, saying, “A bodhisattva great being who does not abide
                                        in any phenomenon at all will attain these supreme qualities of which I have spoken. Boundless Victor, if bodhisattva

                                        that they will gain such qualities as are taught in this discourse. If bodhisattva great beings do not abide in any
                                        phenomenon, neither engaging with nor disengaging from them, I declare that they will attain a boundless ocean of such
                                        qualities. Why is this? Because for bodhisattva great beings there are no phenomena at all to apprehend or abide in.
                                        Thus, without any engagement with or disengagement from even the slightest phenomenon, they abide in the principle of
                                        phenomena without moving. Why is this? It is because, for bodhisattva great beings, there is no abiding and no movement.
                                        Since they do not move, for them there is neither high nor low. Because they are without high or low, they abandon the
                                        high and do not abide in the low. Because they do not abide, it is said that they dwell in the virtuous abode. Those who
                                        dwell in the virtuous abode abide nowhere whatsoever. Abiding nowhere whatsoever, they do not dwell in any abode.
                                        Bodhisattva great beings do not establish or accumulate any phenomena. For them there are no abodes, no abiding, no
                                        origination, and no action. Why is this? Abodes cannot be apprehended. With no abodes, there is no conceptualization.
                                        With no conceptualization, they abide in the realm of phenomena, the unmoving abode. With no abodes, there can be no
                                        abiding. Because they have no dwelling in or grasping toward abodes, this is called <distinct>abiding

                                <p tid="702">Then the bodhisattva great being Anantamati said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, it is truly amazing how you are able to
                                        establish all the bodhisattva great beings in the principle of Dharma, in which there is no bondage and no liberation.
                                        Blessed One, for those bodhisattva great beings who have been skillfully established in the principle of Dharma, with
                                        regard to even the slightest phenomenon, they neither accord nor do not accord with it. They are neither involved nor
                                        uninvolved with it. They neither grasp nor do not grasp at it. They neither rely nor do not rely upon it. They neither
                                        crave nor abandon craving for it. They neither are angry nor abandon anger at it. Blessed One, even when others
                                        respectfully venerate bodhisattva great beings who are skilled in the principle of Dharma, they will not develop
                                        attached craving. If others slander or harm them, they will not develop aggression. Since they do not have a variety of
                                        notions, and because they have abandoned all views regarding phenomena, they do not apprehend any phenomenon as either
                                        associated with or dissociated from any other phenomenon. Thus, because they transcend association and dissociation,
                                        they abandon notions of association and dissociation, and they completely understand all notions of association and
                                        dissociation. As they transcend such understanding, they do not engage in associating with even the slightest
                                        phenomenon, whether advancing, retreating, proceeding somewhere, or proceeding nowhere. <ref cRef="F.122.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-002-1001"/> Since they have no
                                        deluded ideas concerning the principle of all phenomena, and do not grasp anywhere, they employ skillful means so as not
                                        to contradict the nature of phenomena. Blessed One, when bodhisattva great beings observe all phenomena in this fashion,
                                        they skillfully reveal the principle of the realm of phenomena, and thus swiftly perfect all the buddha qualities.” </p>

                                <p tid="703">Then the Blessed One addressed the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, saying, “Anantamati, when bodhisattva great beings do
                                        not establish or abide in the buddha qualities, they see that in the buddha qualities there is no establishment and no
                                        place to abide, and they are also without superior abiding or pervasive abiding. Because they see the buddha qualities
                                        as abiding without movement, without cycling into saṃsāra, and without changing, they abide in accordance with the realm
                                        of phenomena. Thus, they are said to be skilled in establishing the principle of the realm of phenomena. Anantamati,
                                        with regard to the buddha qualities, bodhisattva great beings do not abide or non-abide in them. They are without
                                        superior abiding or pervasive abiding, or abodes or non-abodes. They have no movement, no conceptualization, no superior
                                        conceptualization, and no pervasive conceptualization, and thus it is said that they skillfully establish the principle
                                        of the realm of all phenomena.</p>

                                        of all phenomena to supremely establish. They are without any conceptualization, superior conceptualization, or
                                        pervasive conceptualization, and thus they are said to be skilled in establishing the principle of the realm of all
                                        phenomena. Anantamati, bodhisattva great beings do not see any phenomenon to label as <distinct>abiding</distinct> or
                                                <distinct>going</distinct>. They are without any such conceptualization, superior conceptualization, or
                                        pervasive conceptualization. They see all phenomena as being pure like space, luminously apparent, and free from
                                        afflictions. Because they thus illuminate all phenomena, they are said to have attained the skill in the principle of
                                        the realm of all phenomena to observe the realm of phenomena without engaging in establishment. Why is this? Because
                                        they do not establish anything whatsoever concerning the realm of phenomena. For example, the elements of space and wind
                                        have no abodes; they cannot be seen and cannot be established anywhere. They are not supported anywhere and cannot be
                                        pointed out. Likewise, the realm of phenomena has no place of entry, no place that can be seen, no place that can be
                                        established, no place that can provide support, nothing that can be understood, and nothing that can be shown. Because
                                        bodhisattva great beings have nothing that can be described, they abide in accord with the realm of suchness. </p>

                                <p tid="705">“Anantamati, the realm of all phenomena is a realm that is without birth, without life-force, without aging, without death,
                                        without agitation, without dullness, and without description. Therefore, it is called the realm of phenomena. Because it
                                        is an unchanging realm, it is called the realm of phenomena. <ref cRef="F.123.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-002-1003"/> The realm of phenomena pervades all abodes.
                                        Anantamati, in the realm of phenomena, there is no going and no destination. Lacking any destination, one is said to
                                        abide in accord with the realm of phenomena. There are no abodes in the suchness of the realm of phenomena, nor are
                                        there any non-abodes. Why is this? Because the suchness of the realm of phenomena and the nature of suchness are
                                        nonexistent. </p>

                                        great Dharma that sees the principle of the realm of all phenomena. With the illumination of Dharma, they will attain
                                        the acceptance that phenomena are unborn, and they will quickly be able to perfect the ten powers and eighteen unique
                                        qualities of a thus-gone one, along with all the buddha qualities. In order to ripen vast roots of virtue and
                                        distinctive accumulations for all beings, and in order to ensure the continuity of the lineage of the Thus-Gone One,
                                        they will swiftly proceed to the site of awakening, turn the wheel of Dharma, overpower the abodes of Māra, defeat
                                        contrarian teachers, roar the great lion’s roar of sublime beings, teach the sublime Dharma to all beings, correctly
                                        liberate them according to their hopes, aspirations, and intentions, and thus cause them all to proceed toward

                                        Ambrosia, and the world was called <term>Purifying</term>. <ref cRef="F.125.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-002-1007"/> The field of that buddha was made of crystal, which constantly
                                        radiated light that illuminated the entire world. Any being who was touched by this light became beautiful and lovely in
                                        appearance, which is why the world was called <term>Purifying</term>. Apart from this, there were no other names for towns or
                                        villages. The intersections were wondrously decorated with golden ropes around the perimeters, and the distance between
                                        each intersection was half a league. Between all the roads were rows of eighty-four shining jeweled columns and palm
                                        trees. Additionally, there were four pools surrounded by embankments. The people there lived like gods, in mansions made
                                        of the seven precious substances, which were draped with nets, hung with silken tassels, and beautified with flowers.
                                        The beings of this world were tranquil and happy, having already perfected the path of the ten virtuous actions. They
                                        had gorgeous appearances and long lives, with minimal attachment, aggression, and ignorance. They were easy to awaken,
                                        and they broadly understood phenomena, with little need for skillful means. This thus-gone one’s lifespan reached a
                                        hundred billion years. After his <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">parinirvāṇa</foreign>, his genuine Dharma
                                        teachings remained in the world for ten million years. He taught his assembly the Dharma on ten occasions. In each
                                        assembly were twenty trillion hearers on the level of training. The assembly of bodhisattvas was countless, and all
                                        engaged in the single vehicle.</p>

                                        Likewise, because phenomena are immeasurable, nobody can ultimately fathom their limits. To draw another analogy, all

                                        realize the buddha qualities and skillfully perfect omniscience. When bodhisattva great beings earnestly practice and
                                        study this Dharma gateway, they practice and study all Dharma gateways. Because they see all Dharma gateways within this

                                                phenomena</distinct>, they will attain immeasurable extraordinary qualities. When they abide in the absorption
                                        of the <distinct>oceanic seal of phenomena</distinct>, they can use their skill in the absorption of the
                                                <distinct>oceanic seal of phenomena</distinct> to definitively proceed toward unsurpassed, perfect, and complete
                                        awakening. True Intellect, to draw an analogy, Mount Meru is made from a variety of jewels; and, emerging from the great
                                        ocean to stand eighty-four thousand leagues tall, it abides majestically and shines with the most brilliant light.
                                        Bodhisattva great beings are also like this—having set out well by means of this absorption, they emerge from the ocean
                                        of the storehouse of all phenomena, outshine the entire world of gods and humans, and abide peerlessly, shining with the
                                        most brilliant light. Again, just as the full moon is surrounded by stars, so too do bodhisattva great beings stand out
                                        amidst all the large worldly assemblies of humans and gods. </p>
