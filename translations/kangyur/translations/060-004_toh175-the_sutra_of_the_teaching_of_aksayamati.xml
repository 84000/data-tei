                        “t,” the latter being a convention of modern editors. See Gouriswar

                        common era, <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of Akṣayamati</title> had a
                        significant influence on Buddhist thought. The eighty so-called
                        “imperishabilities” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">akṣaya</foreign>) described in the sūtra—qualities to be possessed by the
                        bodhisatvas—were considered to contain the whole way of religious
                        development of the Mahāyāna, and many passages became <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">loci classici</foreign> employed by the scholars of the
                        Mahāyāna to elucidate their doctrines or to defend certain positions with
                        authoritative sayings.</p>

                    <p tid="11">The sūtra was often quoted in the two great traditions of
                        Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophical thought, the Madhyamaka and the Yogācāra. The
                        Mādhyamikas referred to the section on definitive (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nītārtha</foreign>) and implicit (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">neyārtha</foreign>) meanings to define
                        their position concerning which sūtras were definitive in meaning—the ones
                        teaching emptiness (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śūnyatā</foreign>), the absence of distinguishing marks (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ānimitta</foreign>), and the absence of
                        anything to long for (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">apraṇidhāna</foreign>)—and those that needed further explanation, in
                        order to differentiate themselves from the Yogācāra view that the sūtras
                        dealing with the all-ground consciousness (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ālayavijñāna</foreign>) were implicit in meaning. The
                        adherents of Yogācāra, for their part, quoted <title xml:lang="en">The
                            Teaching of Akṣayamati</title> on all kinds of matters, and for some of
                        them, e.g., Sthiramati (fourth century), it seems to have been one of the
                        main source books on the way of the bodhisatvas. For the
                        Yogācārins, the doctrine of imperishability was regarded as a very important
                        aspect of the Buddha’s teachings. It is said that the sūtra was
                        held in great esteem by Asaṅga (fourth century), as <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of Akṣayamati</title> and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Daśabhūmika</title> (Toh
                        44, ch. 31)<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh44-31.html"/> are supposed to be the two sūtras
                        that convinced his brother Vasubandhu (fourth century) that the Mahāyāna was
                        superior to the Hīnayāna, after Asaṅga had sent one of his <term type="ignore">disciples</term> to recite them to him. According to tradition, Vasubandhu was the
                        author of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Akṣaya­mati­nirdeśa­ṭīkā</title> (Toh
                        3994),<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh3994.html"/> a commentary on this sūtra, and although
                        this work seems rather to have been written by Sthiramati or by someone even
                        later than him, it is very valuable for understanding the text.</p>

                        of the collection known as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāsaṃnipāta</title>, may have been an attempt to systematize the
                        basic religious practices and concepts, as well as the bodhisatva ethics,
                        centered around the idea of the infinity of time and space so favored in
                        early Mahāyāna. Buddhism has never accepted an eternal substance, an eternal
                        Self—the longing for eternity rather found its expression in the concept of
                        reality as infinite and imperishable, though empty and momentary. Some of
                        the early Mahāyāna speculations on infinity were also expressed in the
                        concept of imperishability, and this tradition of thought finally
                        crystallized in <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of Akṣayamati</title>.
                        This concept of imperishability is also connected with another important
                        Mahāyāna idea that combines with it to give <title xml:lang="en">The

                        what is to be seen in the course of our own thoughts, should always question

                        quarrelsomeness. They know the intentions and abilities—whether good or

                        trained. They know the fearless way to be courageous in approaching the
                        stage that consists in remaining on the seat of awakening. They display all
                        the actions and the body of a buddha. They are heroes who have the power to

                        phenomena. It is sameness, with no difference, similar to open space. It

                        phenomena, and they retain what all the blessed buddhas have said. They do
                        not forget it, but they do not remember it either. They find the definitive

                        substance. Morality is without attachment to names and signs, it does not
                        abide by the distinguishing marks of form, and it does not mingle with names
                        and forms. Morality is the absence of causal bad dispositions. It is the
                        nonarising of doctrinal viewpoints, and it does not abide by hindrances like
                        regret. Morality does not abide by the root of nonvirtue that is attachment,
                        it does not abide by the root of nonvirtue that is aversion, and it does not
                        abide by the root of nonvirtue that is delusion. Morality is indefatigable
                        and without desires and thus has the essential character of fitness.
                        Morality is the noninterruption of the buddhas’ lineage because of the
                        attainment of the transcendent body. It is the noninterruption of the
                        lineage of the Dharma because of the attainment of nonseparation from the
                        realm of phenomena. It is the noninterruption of the lineage of the
                        community because the unconditioned is revealed.</p>

                        the isolated buddhas perishes because of their lack of great compassion.

                        is to be seen in having done away with all negativities. (27) Patient

                        Śāradvatīputra, is to be seen in these thirty-two ways.</p>

                        abuse with more abuse, through understanding that thoughts are like

                        determination to be peaceful. One does not feel aversion at not being
                        praised, through the accomplishment of one’s own qualities. One is not
                        flattered by praise, through the absence of conceit. One does not delight in
                        gain, through being well trained. One feels no aversion to loss, through

                        depressed by blame, because one is well established. One is not exalted by
                        praise, since one is unshakeable. One is not fatigued by suffering, through
                        care for living beings. One does not get excited by pleasure, because of the
                        impermanence of conditioned pleasure. One does not become sullied by the
                        ways of the world, since one is dependent on nothing. One patiently accepts
                        violence against oneself, through using no violence against others. One

                        destruction of one’s own body, through desiring the body of a buddha. One
                        patiently accepts every misdeed, through developing the power of performing
                        good actions. One endures pain and suffering, through having the courage to
                        defeat all non-Buddhists. One undertakes every kind of asceticism, through

                        imperishability of the perfection of <term>meditation</term> has sixteen
                        aspects, but it is not found among disciples and isolated buddhas. What are
                        those sixteen aspects? (1) The <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas is
                        not attached to anything, as it is the fulfillment of the
                            <term>meditation</term> of the tathāgatas. (2) The
                            <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas is not tasted, as they are
                        not attached to their own pleasure. <ref cRef="F.111.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-060-004-624"/> (3)
                        The <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas has great compassion as its
                        object, as it eliminates the afflictions of all living beings. (4) The
                            <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas consists in turning away from
                        concentration, as it has the realm of desire as its object. (5) The
                            <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas has completed the
                        preparations for supernormal knowledge, as it knows the mental behavior of
                        all beings. (6) The <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas is fitness of
                        thought, as it knows the power of thought. (7) The <term>meditation</term>
                        of the bodhisatvas knows all <term>meditation</term>s, liberations,
                        concentrations, meditative attainments, and emergence from them, as it
                        conquers both the form and the formless realms. (8) The
                            <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas is tranquil and peaceful, as
                        it conquers the states of <term>meditation</term> of all the disciples and
                        the isolated buddhas. (9) The <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas is
                        undisturbed, as its certitude is infinite. (10) The <term>meditation</term>
                        of the bodhisatvas is the antidote to wrong practice, as it obliterates all
                        the habits of afflictions that connect to new births. (11) The
                            <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas penetrates insight, as it
                        transcends all the worlds. (12) The <term>meditation</term> of the
                        bodhisatvas is preceded by intentions regarding all living beings, as it
                        saves all living beings. (13) The <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas
                        is the unbrokenness of the lineage of the Three Jewels, as it is the
                        fulfillment of the imperishability of the Tathāgata’s
                            <term>meditation</term>. (14) The <term>meditation</term> of the
                        bodhisatvas does not decline, as they are always concentrated. <ref cRef="F.112.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-060-004-625"/> (15) The <term>meditation</term> of the
                        bodhisatvas is the wisdom that masters all phenomena, as it is the
                        fulfillment of all the qualities of the Buddha. (16) The
                            <term>meditation</term> of the bodhisatvas pervades all of space because
                        of the greatness of their wisdom. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this is the
                        bodhisatvas’ perfection of <term>meditation</term> in sixteen aspects, which
                        does not belong to the disciples and isolated buddhas.</p>

                        factors of awakening without distraction, this is their expedient means.
                        When they practice <term>meditation</term> in accordance with all that has
                        been determined, for the bodhisatva, to get rid of the torments of the
                        afflictions and the afflicted states—whether mental or not mental, involving
                        perception or not—that are understood by the tathāgatas’ wisdom, this is
                        their insight. The bodhisatvas who possess such qualities are imperishable
                        through the perfection of <term>meditation</term>, and none of the māras are
                        able to harm them. They are close to the vessel filled with all the
                        qualities of the Buddha, and they will attain the wisdom of
                        omniscience.”</p>

                        authoritative, as it makes manifest the holy principles of the Dharma.
                        Insight is the understanding of all doctrinal viewpoints, all manifestations
                        of afflictions, all hindrances, and all obstructions just as they are.

                        phenomena. Insight clears up all earlier afflictions and bad habits. Insight
                        is the most excellent form of knowledge. Insight is most sublime, as it is

                        Insight is the leader of the adherents of all the vehicles. Insight
                        illuminates, as it removes obscured vision, the darkness of ignorance, and
                        delusion. Insight gives sight to those who wish to see. Insight has no

                        Insight is the way of liberation, as it is the severing of all the bonds of
                        grasping and afflictions. Insight is not stained by any affliction. Insight
                        does not remain in the company of any phenomena that do, or will, create

                        they are not enraged, and they do not seek a way to avoid it. This is how
                        equanimous they are. They endure changes of both body and speech, and this
                        is why it is called <distinct>equanimity</distinct>. They are not hurt by
                        the aspects of the eyes, by the aspects of the forms, or by both. In the
                        same way, they are not hurt by the ears or by sounds, by the nose or by
                        smells, by the tongue or by tastes, or by the body or by physical objects.
                        They are not hurt by the aspects of the mind or by the aspects of mental
                        phenomena. This is why it is called <distinct>equanimity</distinct>. Since
                        they are not hurt or injured, it is called <distinct>equanimity</distinct>.
                        When they are hurt by others, they do not hurt others in retaliation, and
                        this is why it is called <distinct>equanimity</distinct>. It protects
                        oneself, others, and both, and this is why it is called
                            <distinct>equanimity</distinct>. It is the same practice in prosperity
                        and in adversity, and this is why it is called
                            <distinct>equanimity</distinct>. Equanimity is the absence of quarreling
                        and the introspection concerning one’s own thoughts. It consists in
                        protecting the minds of others, considering oneself to be responsible in a
                        conflict, and not hurting others. It is the state of absorption that

                        actions. This is feeling in all its aspects. Furthermore, to the degree that

                        bodhisatvas look at the mind of awakening in this way: ‘The mind never

                        seen by the mind. It does not connect itself to a future mind. What is the
                        mind? It is that by which one thinks, ‘I will awaken to incomparable perfect
                        awakening. The mind of awakening, however, does not dwell together with the
                        roots of virtue, the mind of the roots of virtue does not dwell together
                        with the mind that dedicates, and the mind that dedicates does not dwell
                        together with the mind of awakening.’ If the bodhisatvas do not become
                        afraid, scared, or terrified when they reflect in this way, they are ones
                        who continually consider the mind.</p>

                        It is joyful eloquence. It is quick eloquence. It is unchangeable eloquence.
                        It is sharp eloquence. It is swift eloquence. The bodhisatvas’ eloquence is
                        purified through the results of earlier actions. It is blessed by the
                        buddhas. It is adopted by the gods. It is free of faulty grammar. It is the

                        thought-constructions such as ‘I demonstrate this’ or ‘I teach this.’ Even
                        though they are not conditioned by anything, in whatever assembly they go to
                        they teach the Dharma spontaneously and eloquently, in accordance with the

                        bodhisatvas put on the armor for the sake of incomparable, complete
                        awakening. Through their determination motivated by their vigor, strength,

                        speech, or mind, and all of them engage in physical, verbal, and mental
                        actions that are preceded by wisdom. Many myriads of buddhas will remember
                        you because of your Dharma teaching. Akṣayamati, those who are like me are
                        infinitely tolerant toward holy beings like you.”</p>
