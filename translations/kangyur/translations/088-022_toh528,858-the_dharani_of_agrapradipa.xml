                    <title xml:lang="en">The Noble King of Spells, the Dhāraṇī of Agrapradīpa</title> presents six distinct dhāraṇī formulas that can be used for protection from threatening
                    forces and illness, to facilitate the path to awakening, and to bring the practitioner into harmony with other beings. As the Buddha Śākyamuni resides at Jeta Grove near the city
                    of Śrāvastī, he is visited by two bodhisattvas sent as emissaries by the Buddha Agrapradīpa, who resides in a distant buddhafield named Infinite Flowers. These bodhisattvas present
                    the first of the six dhāraṇīs as an offering to Śākyamuni from Agrapradīpa. Inspired by their example, additional dhāraṇīs are then presented: one each by Maitreya and Mañjuśrī,
                    two by Śākyamuni himself, and a final formula recited by the Four Great Kings. After the presentation of each dhāraṇī, the Buddha tells Ānanda of the rarity of such dhāraṇīs and
                    describes the benefits that accrue from their recitation.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Noble King of Spells, the Dhāraṇī of Agrapradīpa</title> is a text of the dhāraṇī genre that presents a series of six dhāraṇī formulas that can
                        be recited to guard against disease, grant security from danger, and ensure harmony with beings. The narrative of the text begins in Jeta Grove near the city of Śrāvastī, where
                        the Buddha Śākyamuni is teaching a gathering of monks, bodhisattvas, devas, and ordinary people. Two bodhisattvas—Amitābha and Great Light—arrive at that assembly and announce
                        that they are emissaries of Agrapradīpa, the titular buddha who lives in the buddhafield Infinite Flowers located many millions of buddhafields away. After conveying
                        Agrapradīpa’s greetings and well-wishes to Śākyamuni, the two bodhisattvas present Agrapradīpa’s main offering: a dhāraṇī that will protect and benefit all the people of
                        Śākyamuni’s buddhafield. When their recitation of the dhāraṇī is complete, the Buddha addresses Ānanda, exhorting him to remember, recite, and uphold the dhāraṇī. He then
                        describes the rarity of receiving such a dhāraṇī and the benefits that will accrue from using it.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-088-022-6"/>
                    <p tid="10">Five additional dhāraṇīs are recited in the text: one each by the bodhisattvas Maitreya and Mañjuśrī, both of whom are already present in the audience; two by Śākyamuni
                        himself; and a final dhāraṇī recited in unison by the Four Great Kings—Kubera, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūpākṣa, and Virūḍhaka. These dhāraṇīs are presented the same way as before: first
                        it is announced that a dhāraṇī will be recited for the health, happiness, and protection of all beings; next, the dhāraṇī is recited before the assembly; finally, the Buddha
                        encourages Ānanda to uphold the dhāraṇī while explaining to him the rarity of the occasion and the benefits of reciting and transmitting the dhāraṇī. Also included in these
                        descriptions are the number of past lives the reciter will be able to remember, the number of buddhas who have taught the dhāraṇī, and a statement about its secrecy.</p>

                    <p tid="11">Śākyamuni gives his most detailed account of the benefits of dhāraṇī recitation following the second of the dhāraṇīs that he himself recites. In this passage, the
                        Buddha lists the types of supernatural beings who will no longer influence the reciter, the classes of animals that will not be a threat, the types of diseases the dhāraṇī will
                        alleviate, and specific life-threatening circumstances it will protect against. The Buddha completes this description by declaring that it is not possible for anyone under the
                        protection of these dhāraṇīs to be reborn among the gods, humans, asuras, or māras. The Buddha offers a similarly detailed description of the benefits of dhāraṇī recitation,
                        this time in verse, following the presentation of the dhāraṇī by the Four Great Kings. In this passage the Buddha places more emphasis on spiritual benefits, noting that one
                        who recites the dhāraṇī will be free of the obstacles created by Māra, purify billions of eons of karmic deeds, and amass an incredible amount of merit in an exceedingly short
                        time. Following these verses, the text comes to a close as the entire assembly, including the bodhisattvas and Four Great Kings, rejoice and praise Śākyamuni’s discourse. </p>

                    <p tid="12">As a text of the dhāraṇī genre, <title xml:lang="en">The Dhāraṇī of Agrapradīpa</title> features teachings by Śākyamuni and others on the use of dhāraṇī, formulas of
                        syllables and words recited to accomplish mundane goals and to progress on the path to liberation. Derived from the Sanskrit root √<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhṛ</foreign>, which means to “hold” and “retain,” both in the sense of physically holding something and keeping something firmly in mind, as a verbal formula a dhāraṇī
                        can be described as that which “holds” or encodes the teachings or blessings of the buddhas, and so it is extremely efficacious for those who memorize and recite it. Because
                        dhāraṇīs are very often used to achieve the worldly goals of health, protection, and prosperity, they can be used and understood as “spells.” In this and similar texts, the
                        term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> is often used synonymously with the terms <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mantra</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sngags</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vidyā</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rig</foreign>), and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vidyāmantra</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rig sngags</foreign>). This can be seen in the full title of the text, which
                        identifies it as a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vidyārāja</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rig sngags kyi rgyal po</foreign>), a “king of
                            spells,”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-088-022-9"> As the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vidyā</foreign> is feminine, one would expect the title to read
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vidyārajñī</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rig ma’i rgyal mo</foreign>), “queen of vidyās,” and indeed some
                            versions of the Tibetan translation do read <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rig ma’i rgyal mo</foreign> even if the Sanskrit title given is typically the masculine
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vidyārāja</foreign>. </note> and in the body of the text, where the verbal formulas are consistently referred to as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī­mantrapāda</foreign>, translated here as “dhāraṇī-mantra formula.” Much like spells, the formulas in this text are intended to be
                        recited aloud to produce their effects, but in other works a dhāraṇī can also be written down so that it can be worn or otherwise used as a physical protective talisman. While
                        many dhāraṇīs convey clearly articulated meaning, they just as often consist entirely of words with no obvious semantic content. This is the case in <title xml:lang="en">The
                            Dhāraṇī of Agrapradīpa</title>, where it is the alliterative force of the formulas, rather than their meaning, that conveys their power to heal and protect.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-088-022-10"/>
                    <p tid="13">Though dhāraṇīs are used to bring about a wide range of effects from the mundane to the transcendent, it is often the mundane benefits of dhāraṇī recitation that are
                        given priority. <title xml:lang="en">The Dhāraṇī of Agrapradīpa</title> is no different in this regard. Here, we are told that the dhāraṇīs can protect the reciter from a host
                        of threatening forces, including bhūtas, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, vetālas, and similar supernatural beings, as well as from the danger posed by biting insects, snakes, spiders,
                        and predatory animals. These dhāraṇīs will protect one from a wide range of infectious diseases and skin disorders and will even avert the effects of hostile magic. By reciting
                        these dhāraṇīs one will remain safe wherever one is, be it at home, in a royal palace, out in the wilderness, or in situations where one’s life is threatened by fire and water.
                        One can even escape criminal punishment through the use of these dhāraṇīs. Among the spiritual benefits of reciting the dhāraṇīs is the ability to remember multiple past lives,
                        to mitigate the effects of eons of accumulated karma, and to amass in a short period of time the same merit bodhisattvas accumulate over millions of eons. Such is the power of
                        a dhāraṇī as the distillation of the Dharma into short, potent, and broadly applicable formulas to heal, protect, and facilitate one’s progress to awakening. </p>
