                <p tid="2">In this sūtra the Buddha Śākyamuni teaches how bodhisattvas proceed to awakening, without
                    ever regressing, by relying on an absorption known as <distinct>the miraculous ascertainment of
                        peace</distinct>. He lists the very numerous features of this absorption, describes how to
                    train in it, and explains how through this training bodhisattvas develop all the qualities of buddhahood.
                The “peace” of the absorption comes from the relinquishment of misconceptions and 
                indeed of all concepts whatsoever, and the sūtra provides a 
                profound and detailed survey of how all the abilities, attainments, and other qualities of the bodhisattva’s path 
                arise as the bodhisattva’s understanding and realization of what is meant by the Thus-Gone One unfold.</p>

                        The bodhisattva Bhadrapāla, a well-known figure from other Great Vehicle discourses, then initiates
                        the teaching by asking the Buddha to explain how bodhisattvas proceed toward awakening
                        without regressing, how they train on the path, and how they finally awaken to buddhahood.</p>

                    <p tid="274">Having presented the absorption in this very detailed way, the Buddha describes it as being the
                        essence of the Great Vehicle, and explains that the way to put it into practice it is by transcending
                        conceptuality (<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-100"/>). He outlines an approach in which bodhisattvas 
                        examine the nature of the Thus-Gone One by investigating the five aggregates 
                        (<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-101"/>–<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-114"/>). Having discovered
                        that the Thus-Gone One is nowhere to be found within the five aggregates yet is also not different
                        from any of them, they then consider that while nothing inanimate, i.e. without the five aggregates, could be
                        the Thus-Gone One, it nevertheless cannot be the five aggregates that awaken into buddhahood
                        and teach the Dharma. Nor indeed is the suchness of buddhahood brought about by an identifiable 
                        precursor, cause, or indeed any other phenomena. The peace that is buddhahood is the non entertaining of any concepts, thoughts,
                        or reflections regarding reality, and it is by training in the absorption
                            of<distinct> the miraculous ascertainment of peace</distinct> that bodhisattvas will actualize that state. </p>

                    <p tid="9">Next, Mañjuśrī expresses his amazement at the skillful means through which the buddhas can appear in
                        the world even though they are beyond birth and death, and can make the Dharma heard even though they
                        do not actually express even a single syllable (<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-115"/>). The Buddha clarifies this seeming paradox
                        by explaining that in fact thus-gone ones awaken in a perfect buddha realm, but use their skillful means 
                        to manifest an afflicted, degenerate realm in which they engage the minds 
                        of beings while remaining utterly beyond concepts themselves. In engaging different kinds of minds,
                        they may also appear to teach different vehicles, even though in truth there is only one (<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-121"/>). 
                        The Buddha provides several
                        analogies to illustrate his points, and subsequently issues stern warnings against ever creating
                        obstacles to the activity of bodhisattvas (<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-135"/>–<ptr target="#UT22084-055-003-140"/>). 
                        Since bodhisattvas are the buddhas of the future, to obstruct their practices is
                        effectively to work against the manifestation of a buddha.</p>

                        the absorption of <distinct>the miraculous ascertainment of peace</distinct>. The Buddha
                        addresses this question in a vein similar to that of his earlier statements: just like the thus-gone ones, the path too must 
                        be understood to be beyond concepts. Following that path leads to the
                        birth of wisdom and allows the bodhisattva to access all the qualities of awakening. He explains, from
                        this viewpoint, how it is that being rid of all concepts about the true nature of things allows the four 
                        types of correct understanding, the six types of superknowledge, the 
                        thirty-seven factors of awakening, and the four transformative powers to develop

                        points he has made in a passage in verse, and gives yet another reminder of the devastating damage caused by
                        criticizing or disparaging bodhisattvas, especially those who uphold and practice this absorption

                        pacify notions and judgments. It is to keep company with virtue and to discard nonvirtue. It is

                        It is to arouse wisdom, to exhaust existence, to abandon attachment to joyful
                        states, to be certain about buddhahood, and to have no doubt about the Dharma. It is to not be
                        skeptical about the Saṅgha and to reconcile disputes arising from divisive speech. It is to
                        adhere to solitude, to be adept in integrating the teachings, to not speak foolishly behind
                        someone’s back, and to be without worldly goods. It is to abandon what is naturally wrong and to
                        not commit any negative actions, now or in the future. It is to not hoard things and to have no
                        fascination with worldly wonders. It is to see what is wrong with saṃsāra and what is beneficial 
                        in nirvāṇa. It is to wish for the sphere of the transcendence of suffering with strong intent. </p>

                        ‘The Thus-Gone One is not form, but also not other than form. And why? Well, form is
                        inanimate, unmoving, and unable to reason—like hay, bricks, wood, and soil. Form is deceptive
                        like an optical illusion—it is like a mass of foam. What we call <distinct>form</distinct> is an

                        is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering. Whatever is suffering has no
                        self. Whatever has no self has no intrinsic nature. Whatever has no intrinsic nature has no
                        appearance. Whatever has no appearance is not genuine. Whatever is not genuine is a false and
                        deceptive phenomenon. Whatever is a false and deceptive phenomenon is not true. Whatever is not

                        being. What are these four qualities? They are (1) extending timely generosity, (2) being free from

                        the mind of awakening. When practicing these four qualities, one is called a bodhisattva great
                        being. Mañjuśrī, suppose a king or a minister threatens bodhisattvas, saying, ‘If you carry out
                        even a single root of virtue for the sake of another being, even something as insignificant as
                        feeding a single meal to an animal, I will personally destroy you by tearing the flesh off your
                        bones with my nails.’ In that case, they should not be afraid of that threat. Instead, while
                        remaining undeterred and free from worry, they should tell themselves, ‘Even if he were to use
                        his nails to tear off the flesh from as many bodies as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, I
                        would never miss the chance to accomplish a root of virtue, no matter how small, even if it only
                        benefits and helps a single being.’ By that very attitude the bodhisattvas will then surpass
                        even an unstinting offering of everything there is in all the world systems in the ten
                        directions. It would even surpass those roots of virtue that arise from the generosity of as
                        many bodhisattvas as there are atoms in all the world systems in the ten directions, and it
                        would cause the progress of those bodhisattvas toward unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood to be irreversible. It
                        would make them universal monarchs for as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.
                        Likewise, it would cause them to become Brahmā and Śakra as many times as there are grains of

                        buddhas. (4) They will be born in buddha realms in which there is always the presence of a buddha.
                        Even if there should not be any buddha present, they will be born in Jambudvīpa as holy beings

                        bodhisattva should know that there are three great dangers that occur on such grounds. What
                        are those three? They are the danger of taking birth in hell, the danger of being born blind, and
                        the danger of being born in the borderlands. Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattvas receive alms and share them

                        find happiness and success without themselves being concerned with profit or honor, then that

                        void of past, future, and present. As for the eyes being void, their voidness is neither

                        entirely devoid of anything that is permanent, stable, solid, or immutable. Hence, it cannot be

                <term type="definition">The name of the southern continent in Buddhist cosmology, which can signify either the known human world, or more specifically the Indian subcontinent, literally “the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jambu</foreign> island/continent.” Jambu is the name used for a range of plum-like fruits from trees belonging to the genus <foreign xml:lang="la">Szygium</foreign>, particularly <foreign xml:lang="la">Szygium jambos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">Szygium cumini</foreign>, and has commonly been rendered “rose apple” although “black plum” may be a less misleading term. Among various explanations given for the continent being so named, one (in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharmakośa</title>) is that a jambu tree grows in its northern mountains beside Lake Anavatapta, mythically considered the source of the four great rivers of India, and that the continent is therefore named from the tree or the fruit. Jambudvīpa has the vajrāsana at its center and is the only continent upon which buddhas attain awakening.</term>
