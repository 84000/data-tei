                    above the world, in which lives the Buddha Aparimitāyur­jñāna. He states that those who recite,
                    write, hear, and so on, the praise of this buddha, or make offerings to this text, will have
                    numerous benefits, including a long life and a good rebirth. As vast numbers of buddhas recite it,
                    the mantra, or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign>, of this buddha is repeated
                    numerous times. This is the lesser known of the two versions of this sūtra in the Kangyur, but possibly 
                    represents the earlier translation.</p>

                        works in which a particular buddha in another buddhafield is invoked along with the benefits of

                        Associated as it is with longevity, this is one of the most widely read texts in the Kangyur,
                        and Aparimitāyur­jñāna (“Immeasurable Longevity and Wisdom”’) is one of the most frequently
                        portrayed and well-known buddhas in the pantheon of Tibetan Buddhism. </p>

                        contains a dhāraṇī that is repeated in the text twenty-nine times. It is included in many
                        Tibetan liturgical compilations, and its recitation, usually with a specified number of
                        repetitions, is often advised to people in poor health or facing other difficulties, or is
                        commissioned on their behalf in monasteries. </p>

                    <p tid="10">Although its title identifies it as a sūtra, it is placed in all Kangyurs with the
                        Action Tantras (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bya ba’i rgyud</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kriyātantra</foreign>). In common with many other works
                        classified as Action Tantras, there is nevertheless little in the text to identify it as a
                        tantra. The inclusion of a long, repeated dhāraṇī in Sanskrit is presumably one criterion for
                        this classification, although there are many other canonical works with a similar structure that
                        are placed with the sūtras. Other criteria may have been its classification and line of
                        transmission in India, before it was taken to Tibet, or the fact that it has also formed the
                        basis for a wide range of tantra practices, particularly among the higher levels of tantra, in
                        the form of sādhanas of Aparimitāyus.<note xml:id="UT22084-091-073-375" place="end">Tāranātha’s commentary (Tāranātha 
                            2014, pp. 75–7) points out elements of the text that can be interpreted according to 
                            a tantra perspective (primarily but not exclusively that of kriyātantra), in addition to the perspective of the

                    <p tid="11">The text has also survived in a large number of Sanskrit manuscripts (mostly later Nepalese ones);
                        in two Chinese translations; and in a slightly different—perhaps earlier—Tibetan translation, represented
                        by most of the very numerous manuscripts found in the caves of Dunhuang, where a Khotanese
                        manuscript was also found.</p>

                        existence of these two versions is discussed below. The version translated here is the lesser
                        known of the two, is much less widely used, and differs from Sanskrit source texts brought to
                        Tibet in the later translation period to a greater extent than the other version.</p>

                        Tibetan translation represented by the majority of the very numerous Dunhuang manuscripts in

                            that it may represent the translation available in the late eighth century, is one of
                        the set known as the “ten royal sūtras,” thought to be so called either because they represent
                        distillations of the most profound scriptures, or because according to traditional histories
                        they were recommended to King Trisong Detsen for his daily practice by Guru Padmasambhava. As a
                        result of practicing them, the king is said to have extended his life by thirteen years.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-091-073-12"> The story is recounted in chapter 70 of the <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">Padma Kathang</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">padma bka’

                        in the Dunhuang caves is due to their production by scribes there having been commissioned on behalf of
                        Trisong Detsen’s grandson, Ralpachen (who reigned in the early ninth century) in order to ensure
                        for the king the longevity that the text itself promises.</p>

                        the zenith, has been identified to a varying extent in both Tibet and East Asia with Amitābha, buddha of the realm
                        called Sukhāvatī in the west. Both are often referred to by the shortened name Amitāyus in Sanskrit,

                        that has been caused by these partially overlapping identities is discussed in detail in the introduction

                        is by their buddhafields. In this sūtra, the Buddha Śākyamuni clearly introduces
                        Aparimitāyur­jñāna as dwelling in the realm named Aparimita­guṇa­saṃcaya (“Accumulation of
                        Immeasurable Qualities”), which is situated in an upward direction from this world, i.e. toward
                        the zenith. Tibetan authors who commented on the problem, even if they used the short form
                        Tsepamé (Amitāyus), nevertheless took pains to distinguish between the two buddhas. On the one

                        two texts by calling this one (Toh 675) the “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>, no <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">puṇye</mantra>” version

                    presence as Toh 673a, is at the very least that it is a potentially independent stand-alone mantra phrase, making it easier to understand that it might have been either added or 
                    removed, at some stage in the evolving transmission of the dhāraṇī in the sūtra.</p>

                            Nyima Drak in the late eleventh or early twelfth century—a widely accepted belief—in the introduction to that version of the text.

                        for Kangyur texts, colophons and Kangur catalogs. There are no translators’ colophons to either version of the text in any of the
                        different Kangyurs. Most of the Kangyur inventories and catalogs merely list the titles and distinguish them using epithets 
                        such as “three <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” and “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>,”
                        or “long” and “short.” Some, including the catalog of the Degé Kangyur, 
                        explicitly state that the translators are unknown. The one exception is the catalog (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dkar

                        As well as being inherently unlikely, this is at odds with all other sources of information. A look at the folios of the catalog concerned reinforces suspicions of an
                        erroneous attribution, as the carving of the catalog’s woodblocks seems to have run
                        into problems for this entry, which coincides with a folio break. Indeed, the Narthang catalog’s confusing
                        attributions at this point do not reflect the titles or colophons in the body of the Narthang Kangyur

                            translations in earlier generations had been represented only in a variety of localized
                            library collections. Indeed, Ngorchen himself supervised the creation of a Kangyur sponsored

                    <p tid="48">The story of these two different versions may seem already complex enough, but there is
                        more to be explored. Apart from the differences in the dhāraṇī, the other differences (listed
                        above at <ptr target="#UT22084-091-073-45"/> and in the notes) between the two versions in the Kangyurs are relatively minor. These two
                        translations seem most unlikely to have been made independently, even allowing for the
                        possibility that the Sanskrit texts they were made from were very similar. The most obvious
                        explanation might be that the later translation was based on the earlier, adapting it to conform
                        to a slightly different Sanskrit original. However, an examination of the wording and
                        terminology of the Dunhuang manuscripts—which predate the work of Puṇyasambhava and Patsap Nyima Drak by
                        several centuries—shows that they almost certainly represent a Tibetan translation different
                        from the present “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” version (Toh 675) as it has survived
                        in the Kangyur. It is therefore tempting to conjecture that this “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” version in the Kangyur might in fact be a back-adaptation of
                        the later translation, edited at some stage to conform to the alternative 
                        “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” dhāraṇī of the earlier translation but not otherwise reflecting
                        that earlier translation fully. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that a few significant
                        elements of the later “three <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” version that
                        are not present in the “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” Dunhuang
                        manuscripts are present here. Among the most significant in this regard is the similar rendering, common to both Kangyur versions, of what we may presume to be the
                        standard, modular phrase in the Sanskrit manuscripts, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">eva hi tiṣṭhati dhriyate yāpayati</foreign>,

                        and although the compilers and editors of the many Kangyurs do not seem to have noted their reasons, there must have been

                        prevalent there. In 1912 Ernst Leumann made a short comparison of the Sanskrit of this sūtra’s opening sentences with 
                        a few fragments of the Khotanese text. In 1916, two  Sanskrit editions saw the light independently. One, by Sten Konow,
                        compared an edition of a Nepalese Sanskrit version with a complete edition of the Khotanese fragments, along with the first English

                        causing it to be written out, and there is ample evidence that this recommendation was taken
                        seriously in the form of the very large number of commissioned copies, mostly in Tibetan and
                        Chinese and dating to the eighth and ninth centuries, found in the Dunhuang caves by Stein and
                        Pelliot in the early years of the twentieth century. Many of them appear to have been
                        commissioned in the name of the Tibetan king Ralpachen, who reigned in the early ninth century
                        and was the grandson of Trisong Detsen. Among the bundles acquired by the two explorers for the

                        Library in London, and a similar number in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Some five

                    <p tid="52">In the context of tantric practice, the Tibetan canonical literature contains a 
                        number of sādhanas of Aparimitāyur­jñāna, particularly among the higher levels of tantra. One example
                        is the liturgy composed by the tenth-century Jetāri, one of the principal teachers of
                        Vikramaśīla Monastery, which was known for its promulgation of higher tantras. That practice was
                        introduced into Tibet by Bari Lotsāwa Rinchen Drak (mentioned above), and thereby became a part
                        of the Sakya tradition. </p>

                    <p tid="53">There are also five Aparimitāyur­jñāna texts in the Tengyur that were composed by
                        Siddharājñī, a female guru active in India in the beginning of the twelfth century, from whom
                        Rechungpa, pupil of the famous Milarepa, received transmissions that Marpa had not been able to
                        bring back to Tibet. At least three if not all of these Siddharājñī texts were translated into
                        Tibetan by Varacandra,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-091-073-72"> Varacandra is often written
                            in the dialect form of “Walatsandra” and translated into Tibetan as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">zla ba bzang po</foreign>.</note> another of Rechungpa’s teachers,

                            tshul khrims</foreign>), about whom little is known other than this translation work with
                        Varacandra. Rechungpa introduced the practice into Tibet, where it spread from his own lineage,
                        the Rechung Kagyü or Rechung Nyengyü, to other Kagyü traditions. These tantric
                        Aparimitāyur­jñāna practices are based upon the five-family system of the higher tantras, and
                        they involve an elaborate visualization of oneself as a red Aparimitāyur­jñāna, wearing the
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saṃbhogakāya</foreign> costume and holding a vase of

                        a palace, and the visualization of channels within the body. As Aparimitāyur­jñāna is auspicious
                        for long life, his empowerment is given as a long life blessing.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-091-073-73"> Although in some Tibetan traditions Cintācakra, commonly

                        sādhanas have been created over the centuries within all the lineages and schools. The Nyingma tradition of rediscovered

                        little in the literature of recent centuries but, interestingly, the Druptap Küntü collection, already mentioned above, contains two liturgical texts, both

                            that this expanded rendering is how Patshab Nyima Drak, Chödrak Pal (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">kun spang chos grags dpal</foreign>), and Lodrö Pal

                            applying to the one who teaches it (the significance of Tāranātha mentioning the latter two translators, both early fourteenth century 
                            Jonangpa scholars of whom sūtra translations do not appear to have survived, is not entirely clear to us). 
                            The other two commentaries follow similar interpretations, Amnyé Zhab (Amnyé Zhab 2014, p. 47) specifying that 
                            “extending life to its very limit” indeed refers to the actions of Aparimitāyus with regard to beings. Finally, the fact that in the present “two

                            Dunhuang manuscripts it appears in the former, standard rendering, is further evidence 
                            that Toh 675 may be a back-adaptation of this translation to the “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>”

                            another, lost sūtra, or perhaps be a corruption of repeating these actions 108 times.
                            Alternatively—but plausibly only for the other version of the text, the “three <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” 
                                version (Toh 674 and 849)—this could also be a peculiarly worded reference to the dhāraṇī
                            having 108 syllables, which is the case if the two instances of the final and initial
                                <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">a</mantra> in the Tibetan transliteration are
                            elided into <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">ā</mantra> as they should be according
                            to the rules of euphonic combination in classical Sanskrit (and as they are in the Sanskrit
                            versions). Indeed, in the paragraph that follows and in <ptr target="#UT22084-091-073-94"/>,
                            “the one hundred and eight names” does seem to refer to the dhāraṇī, and could therefore be
                            interpreted as “the-one-hundred-and-eight-syllable appellation” of Buddha Aparimitāyur­jñāna. On
                            the other hand, here in Toh 675 and in the other “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” versions

                            nevertheless (although in the case of the Dunhuang manuscripts only in the equivalent of the following paragraph, not in this one). The possible 
                            discrepancy was used by some Sarma authors (see introduction <ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh675.html" inst="link to introduction"/>) as proof that the “two <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="syllable">oṁ</mantra>” dhāraṇī was incomplete,

                        rather to the merit to be obtained by making offerings to him. This same difference between the two versions of the text is present in these three paragraphs, not only in the 
                        Degé Kangyur but also in the other Kangyurs, and does not therefore seem to be due merely to a one-off scribal error. The Nepalese Sanskrit and Khotanese manuscripts 
                        as well as the Dunhuang texts all match Toh 674 in referring to the sūtra, not the tathāgata.</note>

                                classed as tantras. In the division of the Buddha’s teachings into twelve kinds, sūtra

                                what was occuring in the paradises. <term type="ignore">Mañjuśrī</term> is the first
                                prominent bodhisattva after Maitreya in the early Mahāyāna sūtras, where he is known as
                                Mañjughoṣa (“Having a Beautiful Voice”). He came to embody wisdom, and became one of the
                                eight great bodhisattvas. In the early tantras he was the lord of one of the three
                                buddha families. In the Sanskrit version of the sūtra, Kumārabhūta is a separate word
                                rather than a compound with his proper name. This means that it could be the second of
                                his names, and it is glossed as meaning “always young.” Alternatively it could be
                                treated simply as an adjective, as in “the youth <term type="ignore">Manjuśrī</term>.”</term>
