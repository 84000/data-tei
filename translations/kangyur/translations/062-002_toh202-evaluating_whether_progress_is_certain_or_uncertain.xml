                                        progress, he compares five different ways of traveling a very
                                        great distance: using a cattle cart, using an
                                        elephant chariot, using the moon and sun, using
                                        the magical power of the śrāvakas, and using the
                                        magical power of the Tathāgata.</p>

                                                bodhisattvas may make progress on the path, describing five
                                                different ways of traveling as an analogy for that
                                                progress. It begins when its main interlocutor, Mañjuśrī,
                                                asks the Buddha how to evaluate whether it is either uncertain that a bodhisattva
                                                will attain unsurpassable, perfect awakening, or certain that he will attain it. Much of
                                                what follows is the Buddha’s answer: he explains
                                                five spiritual approaches for bodhisattvas,
                                                comparing each with a different method for traveling
                                                very great distances. The five methods are (1) using
                                                a cattle cart, (2) using an elephant chariot, (3)
                                                using the powers of the moon and sun, (4) using the
                                                magical power of the śrāvakas, and (5) using the
                                                magical power of the Tathāgata. Of these five
                                                approaches, the first two would surely not enable
                                                the traveler to reach the spiritual destination of
                                                unsurpassable, perfect awakening, while the last
                                                three would convey the traveler to that destination
                                                and would guarantee that they would not turn back
                                                before reaching it.</p>

                                        <p tid="10">The first two approaches are limited insofar as
                                                they follow the teachings of the Śrāvaka Vehicle,
                                                which thereby impedes the progress of bodhisattvas
                                                who follow such approaches. By contrast, the last
                                                three methods incorporate progressively greater
                                                adherence to and support of the Mahāyāna, which
                                                makes them more effective as spiritual vehicles. The
                                                final method is the most effective of all, insofar as
                                                it carries its adherence to the Mahāyāna to the
                                                highest degree. The sūtra also stresses the great
                                                benefits of devotion to the Mahāyāna. The
                                                section that follows ends with a long
                                                series of comparisons of the relative merits of many
                                                (mostly hypothetical) practices, while also working
                                                in the five methods of travel as types of the mind
                                                of awakening. In a subsequent concluding section,
                                                another long series of comparisons establishes the
                                                great merit of the highest practices of the
                                                Mahāyāna.</p>

Specifically, this term refers to one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">srotaāpanna</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rgyun du zhugs pa</foreign>) and is the first and lowest stage in a list of eight stages or classes of a noble person (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">āryapudgala</foreign>). The person at this lowest stage in the sequence is still on the path of seeing (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">darśanamārga</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mthong lam</foreign>), and then enters the path of cultivation (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhāvanāmārga</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sgoms lam</foreign>) upon attaining the next stage, that of a stream-enterer (stage seven). From there they progress through the remaining stages of the śrāvaka path, becoming in turn a once-returner (stages six and five), a non-returner (stages four and three), and an arhat (stages two and one). This same “eighth stage” also appears in set of ten stages (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">daśabhūmi</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sa bcu</foreign>) found in Mahāyāna sources, where it is the third step out of the ten. Not to be confused with the ten stages of the bodhisattva’s path, these ten stages mark the progress of one who sequentially follows the paths of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and then bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. In this set of ten stages, a person “on the eighth stage” is similarly one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer.</term>
