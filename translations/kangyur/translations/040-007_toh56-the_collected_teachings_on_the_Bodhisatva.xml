                    practices that are to be followed by the bodhisatva, the ideal Mahāyāna practitioner. Through his interactions with human and
                    nonhuman interlocutors, and through stories of various past buddhas, we are led step by step through the topics of renunciation,
                    the mind of awakening, the four immeasurables, and the six perfections. Among the many accounts of past buddhas included in the
                    sūtra, we find the story of the prophecy made by the Buddha Dīpaṅkara to the brahmin Megha about his future attainment of
                    awakening as the Buddha Śākyamuni.</p>

                    <p tid="11">The first chapter opens with the Buddha traveling through the kingdom of Magadha, ending up at Vulture’s Peak in
                        Rājagṛha. There he is approached by the merchant Bhadrapāla and five hundred other householders who have heard about the
                        Buddha and want to meet him and ask his advice. Having praised him, they ask the Buddha why he became an ascetic, and in reply
                        the Buddha describes the various things one has to suffer in saṃsāra, such as the ten afflictions, the ten situations, and so
                        forth, explaining that he understood the futility of a life invested in these things and therefore left the householder life
                        to become a renunciant. He also elaborates on the twelve links of dependent origination, as well as the empty nature of all
                        experiences, and admonishes the householders to give up their desires. The householders are so inspired by the Buddha’s words
                        that they all become renunciants.</p>

                    <p tid="12">In the second chapter we are presented with the more miraculous side of the Buddha’s abilities. A yakṣa named Kimbhīra
                        who is living in Rājagṛha makes various offerings to the Buddha together with a large group of yakṣas, and as a reply the
                        Buddha displays a smile, followed by a miraculous display of light. This is an indication that the Buddha is making a prophecy
                        that someone in the audience will attain complete awakening in the future. Ānanda asks the Buddha whom the prophecy concerns,
                        and in reply the Buddha explains the course Kimbhīra will take on his way to complete awakening in the future. The scene is
                        then prepared for the Buddha to commence his teaching.</p>

                    <p tid="13">The third chapter starts with Śāriputra asking the Buddha about the distinguishing characteristic of a bodhisatva,
                        what it is that makes them special. The Buddha responds that it is bodhicitta, the mind of awakening, that makes them special,
                        and he goes on to explain what this entails, elaborating on the bodhisatva’s insight and the way they will relate to their
                        surroundings. </p>

                    <p tid="15">Chapter 5 presents the setting that frames the main section of the discourse. The Buddha tells Śāriputra about the
                        Tathāgata Mahāskandha and his encounter with the prince Vīryacarita, who is later revealed to have been the Buddha in one of
                        his former existences. This chapter also presents Mahāskandha’s teaching to Vīryacarita on the four immeasurables.</p>

                    <p tid="17">The main literary device in the text, as in much of Buddhist literature, is the list. Typically, the Buddha starts off
                        by posing a rhetorical question to Śāriputra about the topic at hand, and he then answers his own question by stating that the
                        particular phenomenon or issue in question can be divided into a certain number of elements or factors. Apparently for
                        stylistic and perhaps mnemonic reasons, numerical consistency is maintained. A particularly frequent number in this text is
                        ten, and in chapter 1 we see that every list presented is given a tenfold division, even when this is not the number of
                        elements the particular list usually contains, as in the case of the ten kinds of error, which are the opposite of the
                        tenfold, but more commonly the eightfold, noble path. Another recurrent device is to say that a particular topic can be
                        divided into one part, two parts, three parts, and so forth, illustrating the variety of ways it can be analyzed.</p>

                    <p tid="18">The Buddha makes several references to various incidents in the past to illustrate his teachings, some of which
                        concern his own previous lives. In a lengthy passage in chapter 9 dealing with vigor we hear of the two brothers Samvara
                        (Disciplined) and Samvarasthita (Firm Discipline), sons of the merchant Suvicaya. The two brothers happen to meet the
                        Tathāgata Abhyudgata, and being very impressed by him they develop faith and vow to follow the training of the bodhisatva. The
                        vigor with which they approached the practice throughout many lifetimes is held up as an example of what is needed to traverse
                        the bodhisatva path, and the fact that vigor is the topic discussed at greatest length in the text could be seen as an
                        indication of the particular importance perseverance and the perfection of vigor play in the quest to become a successful
                        bodhisatva.</p>

                        Tathāgata Mahāskandha to the prince Vīryacarita, the Buddha points out that the Tathāgata Mahāskandha did not make a prophecy
                        about his future attainment of complete awakening. Later, he reiterates, when the Buddha, in the guise of a merchant named
                        Suprajña, met and paid homage to the Tathāgata Ratnāṅga, he still did not receive a prophecy. Finally, we get the story of how
                        the Tathāgata Dīpaṅkara appeared in the world, and how the Buddha as the apprentice brahmin Megha met him and made heartfelt
                        and lavish offerings to him. Megha consequently receives the prophecy from Dīpaṅkara that he will become a tathāgata, arhat,
                        fully accomplished buddha by the name of Śākyamuni. The Buddha addresses the question of why it was only then, in the presence
                        of the Tathāgata Dīpaṅkara, that the prophecy came, explaining that although there was not a single act of goodness that he
                        had not engaged in while on the bodhisatva path, it was only then, in the presence of Dīpaṅkara, that he realized the sameness
                        of all phenomena and that his practice became free from attributes. Such a practice, he goes on, is what is laid out in the
                        cycle of teachings contained in <title xml:lang="en">The Collected Teachings on the Bodhisatva</title>, and any bodhisatva who
                        wishes to receive a similar prophecy should therefore apply themselves to the teachings contained therein.</p>

                    <p tid="21">This, then, is the core message of the discourse. Although the practice a bodhisatva should engage in is laid out in
                        meticulous detail, we are reminded again and again of the fact that the practices of the bodhisatva, although a necessary step
                        on the way, are only provisional, a means to an end, and that one should not get stuck by investing the practice with any
                        notion that it possesses a true reality, that there is a real self who is engaging in the practice. For, as the Buddha says,
                        “One who does not cling to the idea of a self does not cling to the idea of morality. One who does not cling to the idea of
                        morality does not violate the training, and as he does not violate his training, neither will he violate his morality,
                        although he will still not exaggerate its importance.”</p>

                        They are as follows: because of desire one strives to obtain things, and because of this striving one does obtain things. When
                        one obtains things one develops a sense of ownership, and this sense of ownership causes one to develop firm opinions. Such
                        firm opinions lead to craving, and this craving creates attachment. This attachment causes miserliness, which in turn leads to
                        possessiveness. With possessiveness arises the need to protect and defend one‘s property, and this causes suffering. In order
                        to safeguard their property, people use sticks and other weapons. They get involved in quarrels, conflicts, feuds, and
                        disputes, and this leads them to make unfounded accusations and to do many other such evil, unwholesome things. </p>

                        arises the need to protect and defend one‘s property, and this causes suffering. In order to safeguard their property, people
                        use sticks and other weapons. They get involved in quarrels, conflicts, feuds, and disputes, and this leads them to make

                        extraordinary, an extraordinary phenomenon. It does not appear to the eye and is neither part of nor separate from form. It is
                        not dependent on the ear and is neither part of nor separate from sound. It is not sensed by the nose and is neither part of
                        nor separate from smell. It does not appear to the tongue and is neither part of nor separate from taste. It has no contact
                        with the body and is neither part of nor separate from touch. It is neither active nor inactive in thoughts, in mind, or in
                        consciousness, nor does it follow them. It is accomplished in stability and immovability, a sky-like body, and more vast than
                        the totality of phenomena, and it reaches to the end of space.</p>

                        immeasurable wisdom, his immeasurable liberation, and his immeasurable [MS.25.a] insight into the knowledge of liberation.
                        These are so great, Śāriputra, that if one were to experience all the radiance that could possibly be perceived in the
                        threefold thousand great thousand worlds, then that would not even approach a hundredth part of the radiance of the Tathāgata.
                        It would not even come close. For example, Śāriputra, if one puts ordinary gold next to the gold of the Jambu River, it will
                        look like pieces of soot and will not shine, glow, or radiate light. Likewise, Śāriputra, however much visible radiance could
                        be perceived in the threefold thousand great thousand worlds, it will not shine, glow, or radiate in the presence of the
                        radiance of the Tathāgata. It will not be brilliant, and this is why the radiance of the Tathāgata is said to be better,
                        superior, and supreme in comparison. Śāriputra, if you take even a minuscule amount of the radiance that stems from the
                        ripening of the fruits of the Tathāgata’s previous actions, this radiance will illuminate the threefold thousand great
                        thousand worlds fully.</p>

                        single tathāgata. Such is the morality of a tathāgata. Śāriputra, the morality of a tathāgata will not be exhausted, and the
                        wisdom and eloquence of these tathāgatas will not be exhausted. All these tathāgatas will attain complete nirvāṇa during that

                        wisdom and eloquence, are inconceivable, inestimable, and immeasurable like the sky.</p>

                        accomplished Buddha is able to settle in a kind of concentration wherein the mind is composed to such a degree that he will

                        thousand million billion eons, or even much longer than that. How can he do this? He can do this, Śāriputra, because the
                        tathāgata, arhat, fully accomplished Buddha has attained the highest possible degree of perfection in the supreme perfections.
                        He possesses great magical abilities and has great authority. He is a great lord.</p>

                        it dwell on the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, or the intellect. His mind did not dwell on forms, nor did it dwell on
                        sounds, smells, tastes, physical objects, or mental objects. His mind did not become involved with phenomena. His mind did not

                        Buddha was in. Even though he did not seek out any phenomena, the unimpeded insight of his knowledge could engage effortlessly
                        with all phenomena. Thus, Śāriputra, the stability of the Tathāgata’s concentration, beyond thoughts, mind, and consciousness,
                        cannot be shattered, and he carries out all buddha activities effortlessly.” </p>

                        the future, is completely boundless. Thus, Śāriputra, just as space is completely boundless, in exactly the same way,
                        Śāriputra, the Tathāgata’s power to know the ripening of the fruits of actions is completely boundless. Śāriputra, if it could

                        inconceivable power of the Tathāgata to know the ripening of the fruits of actions, he develops faith, trust, and confidence,
                        and he has no uncertainty or doubt about it. This brings him pleasure, joy, and satisfaction, and as this power is as
                        inconceivable as space, he considers it to be truly wondrous and extraordinary.” </p>

                        recollect his own various past states of existence and those of other people and other sentient beings. He can recollect one
                        past lifetime, two, three, four, five, twenty, thirty, forty, or a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand or innumerable hundreds of
                        thousands of millions of billions of lifetimes. He can remember as far back as an eon of destruction, an eon of evolution, an
                        eon of destruction and evolution, a multitude of eons of destruction, a multitude of eons of evolution, and a multitude of
                        eons of destruction and evolution, and he can state with precision, ‘At that time in the past I had this name, this kind of
                        family, this class, this kind of job. I looked like this, had this gender, and was in this kind of physical condition. This
                        was my lifespan, for that long did I remain, and in these ways I experienced happiness and suffering. Then, when I passed
                        away, I took birth again in that place, and when I passed away again I took birth here.’ In this way, he recollects the
                        details, the places, and the conditions of his own various previous states of existence and those of others. The Tathāgata
                        knows the causes. He knows the past causes of a sentient being, as well as which causes govern what a sentient being becomes.
                        [MS.38.b] With this knowledge, he then teaches the Dharma. He knows the mental continua of all sentient beings in the past. He
                        knows the kinds of mental states in which the arising of particular kinds of mental objects is experienced instantly. He
                        knows, too, what kinds of defective mental objects cause these mental states to disappear. The Tathāgata knows all these
                        things.</p>

                        time, as there is no limit to the knowledge of the Tathāgata. Thus, Śāriputra, the Tathāgata’s power of having clear
                        experiential recollection of past states of existence is inconceivable, incomparable, immeasurable, unfathomable, and

                        will teach the Dharma in different ways, so that sentient beings can relate to these roots of virtue. In that way, they will

                        Śāriputra, by means of the unsurpassed tathāgata knowledge of the divine immaculate eye that transcends the human realm, the
                        Tathāgata sees sentient beings. He knows their deaths and their rebirths, whether those are adverse or fortunate, whether they
                        become beautiful or ugly, and whether they go to higher realms or lower realms, and he knows that this accords with the
                        ripening of the fruits of these sentient beings’ actions. When sentient beings who engage in bodily misconduct, verbal
                        misconduct, or mental misconduct, who denigrate the noble ones, or who hold wrong views see their bodies perish, the results
                        of the actions they have performed based on wrong views will remain, <ref cRef="F.27.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2853"/> and because of these actions, they will end up in the unfavorable lower realms after

                        denigrate the noble ones, and who hold right views perish, the results of the actions they have performed based on right views

                        of phenomena, greater in scope than the grains of sand in the river Ganges, the divine sight of the Tathāgata sees any
                        appearances that arise, everything that is consumed, that perishes, or that develops as a buddha field. He sees the
                        circumstances of the death and rebirth of any sentient being that appears. He sees that any bodhisatvas that appear all die
                        and leave their existence in Tuṣita Heaven, enter the mother’s womb, are born, take the seven steps, leave the royal
                        apartments, and depart. He sees that any lords, buddhas, that appear all realize complete awakening, turn the wheel of the
                        Dharma, reach the end of conditioned life, [MS.39.b] and enter nirvāṇa. He sees that any śrāvakas that appear all attain
                        complete nirvāṇa. He sees that any pratyekabuddhas who appear all have magical vision, and he sees how they purify the gifts
                        they receive. Those beings who have not yet appeared cannot be perceived by those non-Buddhist sages who possess the five
                        superior abilities. <ref cRef="F.27.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2854"/> They do not appear to the śrāvakas, the
                        pratyekabuddhas, or the bodhisatvas, but they do appear to divine sight of the Tathāgata. Within just an area the size of a
                        cart wheel, the number of invisible sentient beings apparent to the Tathāgata are much more numerous than the gods and human
                        beings of the threefold thousand great thousand worlds. The realm of beings who are not apparent is truly immeasurable.</p>

                    <p tid="638">“So it is, Śāriputra, that the Tathāgata scans the realm of sentient beings within the fields of the Buddha with his
                        divine sight, to see which sentient beings could potentially be trained by the Buddha. The Tathāgata appears to every sentient
                        being who could potentially be trained by the Buddha and trains that sentient being, without other sentient beings being aware
                        of it. In this way, Śāriputra, the Tathāgata’s power of direct knowledge of recollection and realization by means of divine
                        sight is as boundless as space, and when the bodhisatva learns of this, he develops great faith, and so forth, as this power
                        is just as inconceivable as space.”</p>

                        patterns are not completely done away with. If one practices within the parameters of the Pratyekabuddhayāna, the defilements
                        are eliminated, but great compassion and eloquence are lacking. The Tathāgata’s elimination of the defilements includes all
                        supreme qualities, as all habitual patterns have been done away with. It encompasses great compassion, and it also includes
                        within its scope his confidence and his power of eloquent speech. The Tathāgata’s elimination of the defilements is thus
                        unsurpassed by anything in the whole world. It is characterized by momentariness. How is this the case? The Tathāgata is not
                        affected by any habitual patterns resulting from previous actions, any habitual patterns resulting from vices, <ref cRef="F.28.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2856"/> or any habitual patterns resulting from mistaken forms of
                        practice. Śāriputra, just as space is completely pure and not affected by pollution in the form of dust or smoke, Śāriputra,
                        the Tathāgata’s power of knowing that the defilements have been eliminated is not affected by any habitual vices. He dwells in

                        defilements and by clinging can eliminate their defilements. He teaches the Dharma in order to destroy clinging, ‘How sad!
                        Sentient beings are engrossed in false mental constructions. You should develop understanding of the way things really are so
                        that the defilements and clinging will no longer arise.’ The Tathāgata teaches them the Dharma using similes and appropriate
                        examples so that they gain understanding of how things actually are, that the defilements are not real, and when they reach
                        this understanding they no longer cling to any phenomena. As they no longer cling to anything, they attain complete
                        nirvāṇa.</p>

                        sameness of the unborn is because of the essential identity of birth. The sameness of nonfabrication is because of the
                        essential identity of fabrications. The sameness of nonarising is because of the essential identity of arising. The sameness

                        which is a thing that is not eliminated is uncompounded. It does not appear, decay, or remain. Therefore, one can say that

                        the state of these things just as they are. In this way, all things are like a single thing, and a single thing is like all

                    <p tid="735">“Śāriputra, awakening is undefiled and without clinging. What is it to be undefiled and what is to be without
                        clinging in this regard? To be ‘undefiled’ is to be free from the four defilements: the defilement of desire, the defilement
                        of existence, the defilement of ignorance, and the defilement of views. To be without clinging is to be free from the four
                        types of clinging: clinging to desire, clinging to existence, clinging to views, and clinging to morality and rituals. All who
                        engage in these four types of clinging are blinded by ignorance and drenched by the waters of desire. When one adheres to a
                        self, one clings to skandhas, elements, and sense fields. [MS.47.a] Because he knows the root of this self-clinging thoroughly
                        and has purified himself, the Tathāgata is able to successfully purify sentient beings. He who has fully purified himself does
                        not harbor any sort of assumption. He who harbors assumptions because of engaging in superficial mental activity is not able
                        to engage in non-superficial mental activity, because of his ignorance. He who does not allow ignorance to proliferate does
                        not see the appearance of the twelve limbs of existence, and there is then no birth. To be free of birth is to arrive at
                        certainty. When one arrives at certainty, the clear, explicit truth is established. When the clear, explicit truth is
                        established, one has arrived at the ultimate truth. The ultimate truth is that no person really exists. The truth that no
                        person exists is the truth of inexpressibility. The truth of inexpressibility is the reality of dependent origination. The
                        reality of dependent origination is the reality of phenomena. The reality of phenomena is the reality of the Tathāgata. That
                        is why it is said that one who sees dependent origination sees the Dharma, and one who sees the Dharma sees the Tathāgata.
                        Thus, when he sees, <ref cRef="F.38.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2878"/> searching for the truth, he does not see
                        anything. What is ‘anything’ in this regard? It is the freedom from attributes and the lack of anything that is apprehended.
                        One who sees the freedom from attributes and the lack of anything that is apprehended sees what is real. In this way, the
                        Tathāgata’s full understanding of all phenomena is the same as sameness. With great compassion for sentient beings, the
                        Tathāgata sees that ordinary, immature beings do not recognize this undefiled quality that is free of clinging, and so he
                        pledges to help them realize it.</p>

                        blemishes. Thus, purity, stainlessness, and freedom from blemishes relate to a single state, the state of tranquility.

                        unerring in their bodily conduct. The Tathāgata conducts himself with grace. Looking ahead and all around, with graceful
                        limbs, carrying his robes and bowl, he goes from place to place. He leaves and returns, <ref cRef="F.40.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2882"/> walks, stands, sits, and lies down, and enters and leaves villages and towns, without the

                        enjoy comfort for seven nights, and when they pass away, they are reborn in the fortunate heavenly realms. Although his robes

                        able to stir them. The radiance of his body reaches as far as the Incessant Hell, filling the sentient beings there with

                        authentically, he speaks truly, he speaks appropriately, and he speaks accurately. What he says is well stated. What he says
                        is pleasing to all sentient beings. What he says is not repetitive. What he says is meaningful and beautiful. When he utters

                        if sentient beings praise him, nor does he become agitated if sentient beings criticize him. The Tathāgata does not express

                        strife, and he is without egotism, without attachment, without clinging, and free from all knots. These are the reasons the
                        Tathāgata never makes any noise. [MS.49.a] And just as he does not make any ill-considered noise, he teaches the Dharma so
                        that sentient beings, too, may avoid all types of ill-considered noise. This is the second of his unique buddha qualities.</p>

                        comes to presenting teachings that accord with the merit of a particular individual. Since his knowledge that sees the past,
                        the present, and the future is unobstructed, his command of meaning, objects, etymology, and eloquence is unfaltering. Thus
                        the Tathāgata himself is unfaltering, and his knowledge sees the past, the present, and the future without obstruction. He

                        indivisible. The Tathāgata has no preferences with respect to phenomena, because their actual nature is free from attachment.

                        related to the cultivation of the mind, the cultivation of morality, [MS.49.b] and the cultivation of wisdom, and it does not

                        matters. The equanimity of the Tathāgata is conducive to what is noble, and it is not conducive to what is ignoble. The

                        the body, or the mind, the Tathāgata does not lack faculties. His concentration is not reliant on the earth element. It is not

                        eons. It is a knowledge that can alleviate the doubts that come from such questions as ‘how’ or ‘why.’ It is a knowledge that
                        is always unimpeded. It is a knowledge that teaches by assigning one to whichever of the three vehicles is appropriate. It is
                        a knowledge that comprehends sentient beings’ eighty-four thousand kinds of mental activity. It is a knowledge that can assign
                        what is appropriate among the eighty-four thousand categories of teaching. This understanding of the Tathāgata is boundless
                        and imperishable because his teaching with wisdom is imperishable. <ref cRef="F.44.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2889"/> Therefore, the wisdom of the Tathāgata is never given up, and he thus teaches the Dharma
                        to sentient beings so that they may attain imperishable wisdom. This, Śāriputra, is the eleventh of his unique buddha
                        qualities.</p>

                    <p tid="771">“Moreover, Śāriputra, the liberation of the Tathāgata is never given up. What is the liberation of the Tathāgata? The
                        liberation of the śrāvakas lies in the fact that they follow only verbal expressions. The liberation of the pratyekabuddhas
                        comes from their contemplation of conditions. The liberation of the lords, the buddhas, is their freedom from all sorts of
                        clinging and ideas of duality. Liberation implies that one is not bound from the outset, one does not continue at the end, and
                        one does not remain in one’s present state. It is freedom from grasping at the duality of eye and form. In the same way, it is
                        freedom from grasping at the dualities of ear and sound, of nose and smell, of tongue and taste, and of body and physical
                        objects. It is a liberation that is based on the absence of grasping and the absence of attachment. Knowledge is the natural
                        luminosity of the mind, and that is why it is said that the wisdom inherent in a single moment of thought can lead to the
                        realization of unsurpassed perfect awakening. As he is perfectly awakened, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to sentient
                        beings. This, Śāriputra, [MS.51.a] is the twelfth of the Tathāgata’s unique buddha qualities.</p>

                        conform with the Dharma. They are timely, relevant, and not excessive. He teaches, knowing whose abilities are adequate and
                        whose are not. It is ornamented with generosity. It is purified by morality. [MS.51.b] It is accomplished through patience. It

                        so? The Tathāgata does not express himself through his mind. It is not by means of mental capacity or consciousness that the
                        Tathāgata expresses his knowledge, that he becomes the lord of knowledge. The knowledge of the Tathāgata can engage with the

                        themselves when they practice the bodhisatva path? Śāriputra, the conduct of bodhisatvas is good in three ways. What are these
                        three ways? They are good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct. Now, what does good bodily conduct
                        imply? Śāriputra, good bodily conduct implies that a bodhisatva abstains from taking life, abstains from taking what is not
                        given, and abstains from sexual misconduct. Moreover, Śāriputra, good verbal conduct implies that a bodhisatva abstains from
                        lying and abstains from slander, harsh words, and inane chatter. Finally, good mental conduct implies that a bodhisatva is not
                        covetous, is without malice, and holds right views.</p>

                        meant by <distinct>good bodily conduct</distinct>.’ What about good verbal conduct? He reflects, ‘The verbal acts that should

                            conduct</distinct>.’ What about good mental conduct? He reflects, <ref cRef="F.62.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2925"/> ‘The acts of the mind that should not be carried out are being covetous, being malicious,

                    <p tid="877">“He then investigates whether the abstention from acts of body, speech, or mind can be conceived of. Through sincere
                        investigation he comes to see that it is impossible to conceive of the abstention from acts of body, speech, or mind as being,
                        for example, blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystal, or silver. It is not something that can be perceived by the eye, the
                        ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, or the mind. Why? It does not arise, is not created, does not occur, and is not engaged
                        with; it cannot be understood as being performed by someone. His conclusion will be that morality is not conditioned in any
                        way, and anything that is not conditioned is not something that can be conceived of. Something that cannot be conceived of is
                        not something one can apply oneself to. In this way, he does not focus on the morality of good conduct. In the same way, he
                        does not focus on someone who is moral or on the morality to which he applies himself. When he has seen this, the view of
                        self-entity will not arise in him, as it is the view of self-entity that leads one to be intent on analyzing morality and
                        immorality. When he has seen this, he is thoughtful in his commitments, his observances, his practices, and his
                        responsibilities, as it is through thoughtful conduct that one comes to be known as a moral individual. However, he does not
                        cling to the idea of a self, and he does not cling to the idea of another, so his morality is never given up; his morality
                        remains untarnished. <ref cRef="F.62.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2926"/> Clinging to the idea of a self leads to
                        clinging to the idea of morality, but one who does not cling to the idea of a self does not cling to the idea of morality. One
                        who does not cling to the idea of morality does not violate the training, and as they do not violate their training, neither
                        will they violate their morality, although they will still not cling to it. The reason they do not cling to it is that
                        [MS.61.b] they know that all phenomena exist in relation to other phenomena. That which exists in relation to other phenomena
                        has no self, and when there is no self, what is there to cling to?”</p>

                        the tips of blades of grass, none of them will last very long; they will vanish when the sunlight hits them. In the same way
                        Śāriputra, just like a dewdrop this insubstantial body will not last long. Śāriputra, however much froth may accumulate on the
                        oceans, in rivers, and in streams, it has no substance and is by nature fragile. So it is, Śāriputra, with this insubstantial
                        body. It is by nature fragile, just like froth. Śāriputra, just as raindrops in the sky appear and vanish one after the other,
                        this body, Śāriputra, is insubstantial and fragile by nature, like a raindrop. ‘Therefore, I will put this insubstantial body
                        to good use.’ </p>

                        involved, that no evil would come from that. I believed that even if one were to give all sentient beings enough gifts to fill

                        lower states of existence, such as hell. In the hell realm I was burned, I swallowed embers, and I experienced only sharp

                        wretched human being, a poor human being. I became a servant under the rule of others, [MS.65.a] under the rule of beings who
                        were greedy for pleasures of the senses, caught up in pleasures of the senses, who acted in coarse ways and upheld wrong
                        views, whose morality was misguided, whose practice was misguided, and whose views were misguided, who engaged in the three
                        unwholesome roots and the four wrong ways of approaching things, who were clouded by the five obscurations, who had no
                        reverence for the six kinds of gurus, who resorted to the seven kinds of untrue teachings, who were caught up in the eight
                        kinds of mistakes, who were overcome by the nine types of harmful acts, who were following the wrong path and engaging in the
                        ten unwholesome forms of conduct, heading along the road to hell, <ref cRef="F.68.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2938"/> who had turned away from the road that leads to the celestial realms, who had abandoned

                        wholesome actions, and who were engaging in unwholesome actions. I was terrorized with sticks. I felt the terror of fear and
                        had to act against my will. I was forced to carry loads and had to honor and serve them.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-1089">The Sanskrit has a negation in this expression, implying that the bodhisatva could not, in

                            implying that the bodhisatva had to honor and serve the beings who ruled over him.</note> In this kind of state, I had no

                        without anything negative would not be positive without anything negative. I did not consult with ascetics and brahmins and
                        ask, “Venerable ones, what is wholesome, and what is unwholesome? What is irreproachable, and what is reproachable? What

                        borders—astrologers, high officials, guards, counsilors, townspeople, and villagers—will venerate him. The second weighty
                        position he gains, Śāriputra, is that he will not in any way be attracted to the five pleasures of the senses. What are the

                        the body. He will not be attracted to these five pleasures of the senses in any way, and because of his faith he will leave
                        the ordinary household life behind and become a renunciant. He will quickly attain the five superior abilities, and he will be
                        venerated by human and nonhuman beings alike. The third weighty position he gains, Śāriputra, is that wherever he is born he
                        will always have an exceptional intellectual capacity, exceptional wisdom, and exceptional eloquence. He will have the fame of
                        a king. He will be treated in the same way Mahauṣadha was in the past, and he will be awarded a seat of honor within the royal

                        roots of virtue possesses, Śāriputra, is that as soon as the bodhisatva is born he is not restricted by anything external. He
                        has a full overview of the regions in the four directions. His knowledge blazes. How does this happen? As the bodhisatva was
                        unwavering in his search for learning in the past, he attained an undeceiving eye, and with this undeceiving eye, which is
                        divine sight of supreme purity that surpasses anything human, the bodhisatva can see all sentient beings in the threefold
                        thousand great thousand worlds, however many they may be. This great knowledge the bodhisatva has obtained is also very swift.
                        With this great knowledge, the bodhisatva is able to know the states of mind of all sentient beings in the three times. How is
                        he able to do this? As the bodhisatva was purposeful in the past, focused, and fully engaged with the teachings, and as he had
                        respect for them, viewing them as medicine, as precious, as difficult to encounter, and as authentic, he became learned, and
                        as a result of this the bodhisatva obtained very swift analytical abilities. With these analytical abilities the bodhisatva is
                        able to examine the morality of all sentient beings, as well as their learning, concentration, wisdom, <ref cRef="F.78.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2958"/> liberation, and insight into the knowledge of liberation. He is able to

                        insight into the knowledge of liberation. [MS.71.a] He is able to examine what the effects of the morality of all sentient

                        knowledge of liberation will be. He is able to examine how the effects of the morality of all sentient beings becomes greater,
                        as well as how the effects of their learning, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge of liberation become greater.
                        He is able to examine the religious practice, conduct, progress, and effort of all sentient beings. He compares himself with
                        all sentient beings. He compares the morality, learning, and so forth, up to insight into the knowledge of liberation, of all
                        sentient beings with his own. He compares the general level of morality of all sentient beings, as well as their general level
                        of learning, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and insight into the knowledge of liberation, with his own. He compares the
                        effects of all sentient beings’ morality, as well as the effects of their learning, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and
                        insight into the knowledge of liberation, with his own. He compares how the effects of the morality of all sentient beings
                        become greater, and how the effects of their learning, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and insight into the knowledge of
                        liberation become greater with how his own become greater. He takes the religious practice, conduct, progress, and effort of
                        all sentient beings and holds it up against his own merits. He is not able to find anything in all this that can compare to

                        beings who are in the best possible conditions, he is not able to find anyone who can compare to himself. His analytical
                        abilities are so swift, Śāriputra, that the bodhisatva knows instantly what the effects of the ripening of the fruits of
                        previous actions will be. In the blink of an eye, he knows a thousand different aspects of the minds of all sentient beings,
                        and among all of them he is not able find any that compare to himself. He knows that he himself inhabits an exceptional
                        position, and then like a lion, like an elephant, he takes seven uninhibited steps across the ground. He faces the place that
                        is destined to be the seat of his awakening and proclaims, ‘I am supreme in the world. I am foremost in the world. I will put
                        an end to birth, aging, and death. I will liberate sentient beings from the torments of birth, aging, and death. I will
                        provide them with the vastness of the Dharma.’ Śāriputra, as soon as the bodhisatva has spoken these words, their sound
                        carries across the threefold thousand great thousand worlds and are known throughout them. Great earthquakes are felt in the
                        world, and formidable divine drums that cause one’s hair to stand on end resound perpetually. The ground on which the
                        bodhisatva stands, an area the size of a wheel, remains unmoving. All the water in that place remains undisturbed by the wind.
                        His overview of things is complete, and he sees what his own role is, but no sentient being is able to observe that he is an
                        unsurpassed, fully accomplished buddha. These, Śāriputra, are the four unobservable qualities of the bodhisatva. What causes

                        beautiful’ brings liberation. When liberation occurs, elimination occurs. What is it that is eliminated? Desire is eliminated.

                        Without conceptualization, no mental constructs take place. The abandoning of mental constructs is not something that is real,
                        and that which lacks desire is not something that is real. <ref cRef="F.86.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2973"/>

                        the case? Nirvāṇa is not something within the mental sphere. It is that which eliminates desire. Thus, the elimination of
                        desire is defined as nirvāṇa. Desire is one thing, and nirvāṇa is another. That which is other is beyond other things. And
                        that which is beyond other things is what the wise seek. In seeking this they do not apprehend an essence. Something that has

                        Mental conditioning comes from grasping at ownership. Conditions are created in four ways. What are these four ways? One can

                        accommodation is a danger, and he thinks, ‘I have no interest in such danger.’ As a consequence of this, Śāriputra, the

                        intense attachment to forms that are perceived by the eye. This is what is meant by <distinct>passion</distinct>. Moreover,
                        passion is said to be the intense attachment to sounds that are perceived by the ear, as well as the intense attachment to

                        with ideas such as a self, a life force, a person, permanence, constancy, durability, substance, wholeness, and solidity. This

                        investing a great deal in the identity that one has built, and it entails having a selfish love and affection for one’s wife.
                        When one is bound by the fetters of form, one remains focused on satisfying one’s passions, and so one accumulates unwholesome
                        karma. One does not understand the faults of passion. What are the faults of passion? Even though there is no passion in those
                        whose faults have been purified, or passion in faults, still, the faults of passions lead one to the lower states of
                        existence, and so that is what I teach. How is it that the fault of passion leads to the lower states of existence? I assure
                        you, Śāriputra, that there is no evil that someone who is governed by passion will not commit. When the fruits of his actions
                        ripen, [MS.77.b] there is no suffering that he will not have to endure. This is why, Śāriputra, there is no greater enemy in

                        then there is good reason for it. When the ignorant grasp after things, that is a mistake. What is it that the ignorant grasp
                        after? They grasp after conditioned things. They grasp after sons, daughters, and wives. This is what they grasp after, and as
                        they are entangled by grasping they are not seized by the noble path. Being caught up in sons, daughters, and wives leads to
                        attachment and craving and is a hindrance to the renunciant life. It is a hindrance to morality, a hindrance to meditation, a
                        hindrance to heaven, and a hindrance to nirvāṇa. Keeping male and female servants and having sons, daughters, and wives is a
                        hindrance to any kind of wholesome practice. Similarly, when one has sons, daughters and wives, one is providing for an enemy,
                        and one is providing for the hell realms, the animal realms, and the spirit world governed by Yama. In short, one is providing
                        for all imaginable unwholesome things. These things are a hindrance to healthy sustenance, and they are a hindrance to seeing
                        the Buddha. Similarly, they are a hindrance to hearing the Dharma, to serving the Saṅgha, to seeing the Buddha and developing
                        faith in him, to hearing the Dharma and developing faith in it, to serving the Saṅgha and developing faith in it, and to
                        encountering favorable conditions. Similarly, they are a hindrance to attaining the riches of faith, the riches of morality,
                        the riches of learning, the riches of wisdom, the riches of renunciation, the riches of modesty, and the riches of
                        self-control. One becomes distrustful when one has wives, sons, and daughters. Likewise, one becomes immoral, stingy, mean,

                        sons, and daughters. When one has wives, sons, and daughters, one becomes sick, with boils and pain, one takes hold of the
                        fire element, and one takes hold of a poisonous snake. Living as a householder is like living in a charnel ground. I tell you,
                        the charnel ground of the house is a barren wasteland that steals away everything that brings any benefit. Enjoying wives,
                        sons, and daughters, Śāriputra, is like enjoying a bolt of lightning. It is like enjoying a sharp sword or a seat of molten
                        iron. When one enjoys fragrant flowers, rosaries, and ointments, one is in fact enjoying an iron seat, a garland of iron
                        balls, and an ointment of feces and urine. Keeping a house is like keeping an iron kettle. Someone who keeps male and female
                        servants and workers and laborers is providing for the guardians of hell. Someone who keeps elephants, horses, buffaloes,
                        donkeys, sheep, fowl, and pigs is providing for creatures such as Śyāma and Śabala to be dispatched for a hundred yojanas.

                        practicing the way of the bodhisatva and encountered sentient beings who spoke to me harshly and abusively out of anger,
                        speaking harsh and slanderous words, because I was a bodhisatva no anger, hatred, confusion, miserliness, or distress arose in
                        me. As I stand here in the midst of cyclic existence, there would be nothing so easy to resort to as anger and speaking in
                        harsh ways. This is why we should cultivate equanimity. In such encounters we should cultivate compassion. Why is this? The
                        more one displays anger and speaks in harsh ways, the more one will experience the ripening of the fruits of these actions.
                        One will receive anger and harsh words in return. Wherever one is reborn, <ref cRef="F.96.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2994"/> one will be ugly and disfigured. I do not wish to be ugly. I do not wish to be angry and
                        speak in harsh ways. Why is this? It is because these things are improper. These are improper ways of acting. They are
                        immature actions. They are small-minded actions. They are not the actions of good men. They are actions that bring unwanted
                        results. With anger and harsh words one falls into the hell realms; one falls into the realms of animals. This is the nature
                        of actions such as anger and speaking harsh words. One falls into the spirit world governed by Yama. This is the nature of
                        actions such as anger and speaking harsh words. One becomes enslaved in hell. This is the nature of actions such as anger and
                        speaking harsh words. One becomes an impoverished yakṣa. This is the nature of actions such as anger and speaking harsh words.
                        Such actions are the root cause of the poverty of a yakṣa. This is the nature of actions such as anger and speaking harsh

                        not able to keep them in mind, I should reflect in the following way, “What is the difference between myself and these

                        Furthermore, he will approach the training in this way: [MS.82.b] ‘Even if they were to chop off my head as many times as
                        there are grains of sand in the river Ganges before I could take the first seven steps, I would still not become annoyed or

                        and unsurpassed perfect awakening would be that much harder to achieve. It would be that much harder to meet with the Dharma.

                    <p tid="1275">“Śāriputra, Māra will surely appear to the Mahāyāna practitioner who is aggressive and create obstacles to the
                        attainment of unsurpassed perfect awakening. Someone who is aggressive will lose his focus on awakening, and with a scattered
                        mind, he will be vulnerable to evil Māra’s demonic ways. What are the demonic ways of Māra? They are to have a demonic
                        attitude toward the begging bowl, to have a demonic attitude toward the monastic robes, to have a demonic attitude toward
                        begging for alms, to relate to success, honor, and praise in a demonic manner, the demonic attitude of being disinclined to
                        become a renunciant, the demonic attitude of being disinclined to act in beneficial ways, the demonic attitude of being
                        disinclined to remain in retreat, the demonic attitude of being disinclined to attain unsurpassed perfect awakening, and the
                        demonic attitude of heedlessness toward preceptors and teachers. Śāriputra, one who is aggressive will lose his focus on
                        awakening, and when his mind is scattered, Śāriputra, the evil Māra <ref cRef="F.99.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-2999"/> will lead him in the direction of these demonic ways. Śāriputra, the evil Māra looks for

                    <p tid="1276">“Śāriputra, I recall a certain occasion in the past when I was a seer by the name of Cāritragocara, and the evil
                        Māra produced five hundred aggressive and powerful men. They hounded me continually for five hundred years. They abused me at
                        night. They abused me during the day. They abused me when I was leaving. They abused me when I was coming. They abused me when
                        I was standing and sitting. They abused me when I was sleeping. They abused me when I was walking. They abused and verbally
                        attacked me when I was resting, when I was in the village, when I was traveling, when I was at home, when I was resting on the
                        road, when I was resting at home, when I was going on retreat, when I was staying in retreat, and when I was resting in
                        retreat. They spoke evil and harsh words to me in these various situations, hounding me continually for five hundred years.
                        Still, Śāriputra, I recall that throughout these five hundred years, not only was it not an option for me to have any
                        antipathy toward them, but I would look upon them with an attitude of love.</p>

                        character is virtuous, whose nature it is to have little desire, little anger, and little confusion, that I will attain
                        unsurpassed perfect awakening. Rather, it is for the sake of those sentient beings who are unruly, undisciplined, and immoral,
                        whose character is evil and whose nature it is to experience much desire, much anger, and much confusion, [MS.83.a] that I
                        will attain unsurpassed perfect awakening. It is these beings, first and foremost, who I will help toward nirvāṇa.’ Śāriputra,
                        this was the attitude of nonaggression that I kept in mind at that time. This, Śāriputra, is how the Tathāgata perfected his

                        to unsurpassed perfect awakening and had in his possession a piece of meat, and imagine that some hungry and thirsty person
                        then came to ask him for this meat, but in asking they said, ‘Anyone who gives me a piece of meat will destroy all the roots
                        of virtue he has cultivated in the past. He will displease a thousand buddhas in eons to come. He will roast in the great
                        hells for a hundred thousand eons.’ In a situation like this, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva should ask for that person’s
                        attention: ‘My good man, I am fully aware of these states of misery, but you will have a pleasant experience.’ If he accepts
                        the piece of meat with the words ‘This will give me pleasure,’ then the bodhisatva should give the meat to that person without
                        concern, with the strength of an undiscouraged mind, an unrelenting mind, an undepressed mind, with a mind free of impurities
                        and miserliness. How so? He thinks, ‘Let trouble come to me. Let this person experience pleasure. I will make sure that all
                        sentient beings are happy, and this applies equally to this situation. We should make the person who is in front of us happy.’
                        This, Śāriputra, is the quality of limitless compassion that bodhisatvas possess. It preserves and guards one’s morality. It
                        enables one to attain awakening.”</p>

                        patience. Nonviolence is a sign of bodhisatva patience. The absence of disputes is a sign of bodhisatva patience. The absence
                        of aggression is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Guarding oneself is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Guarding others is a sign
                        of bodhisatva patience. Guarding one’s body is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Guarding one’s speech is a sign of bodhisatva
                        patience. Guarding one’s mind is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Investigating everything thoroughly is a sign of bodhisatva
                        patience. [MS.84.a] Not wishing for nirvāṇa is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Accepting the ripening of the fruits of previous
                        actions is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Being physically pure is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Being verbally pure <ref cRef="F.100.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3001"/> is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Being mentally pure is a
                        sign of bodhisatva patience. Experiencing the excellent states of a god or a human being is a sign of bodhisatva patience.
                        Coming to possess the major and minor marks of a tathāgata is a sign of bodhisatva patience. The attainment of the resounding
                        speech of a tathāgata and the voice of <term ref="UT22084-040-007-2609">Brahmā</term> is a sign of bodhisatva patience.
                        Following the way of the bodhisatva and never allowing one’s roots of virtue to perish is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Being
                        beyond any attack from others is a sign of bodhisatva patience. Delighting in setting one’s opponents on the right path is a
                        sign of bodhisatva patience. In short, possessing the powers, confidence, unique qualities, great compassion, great love,
                        great empathetic joy, and great equanimity of a tathāgata and being replete with all the characteristics of a buddha is a sign

                        Agnidatta. They believed in the self, in the person, in annihilation, and in permanence. They joined forces, and they worked
                        together to make the following plan: ‘We should each take responsibility for one hundred households, and we should argue our
                        case in these one hundred households. <ref cRef="F.110.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3021"/> We should each argue

                        they visited, the first thing they would do was to make disparaging remarks about the Buddha. What sort of disparaging remarks
                        did they make about the Buddha? When they entered the houses they would say, ‘A self exists. A being exists. A life force
                        exists. A person exists. If there were no self, what would come [MS.89.b] and what would go? What would stand, what would sit,
                        and what would lie down? What would speak, and what would be silent? What would give a gift, and who would receive it? What
                        would eat? What would feel the sensations of happiness and suffering? Whoever has told you that there is no self, no being, no
                        life force, and no person is not a suitable spiritual guide for you. He is not a spiritual friend.’ So, Śāriputra, women and
                        men, boys and girls, would say, ‘Someone like this is not a spiritual friend. He is evil. An evil friend is not a spiritual
                        friend. The people who have explained this to you are learned, and so you should believe them when they say that someone who
                        is an evil friend is not a spiritual friend. Therefore, if someone tells you that there is no self, no being, no life force,
                        and no person, do not rely on him, do not associate with him, and do not serve him.’ In this way, these mendicants each
                        influenced five hundred households in the space of two weeks.</p>

                        is not worth knowing. He does not know what should be known. Whatever he concerns himself with, he cannot be trusted, and he
                        develops bad habits in his relations with householders. The mendicant talks about three things. What three things does he talk
                        about? He talks about the faults of the dwelling. He expresses his dissatisfaction and dismisses the house. He makes false
                        excuses, saying, ‘They are deceitful, these wicked men,’ and he teaches the Dharma believing his own statements. This,

                        attention. They lack faith, they abandon a life of solitude, and they gather many acquaintances. Householders will tell them,
                        ‘Venerable ones, you should come and stay close to our dwellings, so that we can provide you with clothing, food, bedding,
                        seats, medicine for the sick, and utensils. If the venerable ones remain in remote dwellings, you will not see us, and we will

                        and unbreakable, a vajra body, undying, and unborn. He may let it come into harm’s way when he is using it to train those
                        sentient beings who are receptive to the training, but it can be neither burned by fire nor harmed by weapons. It is firm like
                        a vajra and cannot be broken. In this way, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva whose vigor is unyielding and whose mastery of the Dharma

                        without deliberating about it, and without assumptions. He understands that the body is characterized by separateness. From
                        the fact that the body is characterized by separateness, he understands that all phenomena are characterized by separateness.
                        Because of this, he makes no distinction between the fact that the body is characterized by separateness and the fact that all
                        phenomena are characterized by separateness. Whatever characterizes the fact that the body is characterized by separateness
                        also characterizes the fact that all phenomena are characterized by separateness, and he takes these to be the very same
                        characteristics of separateness. The fact that one’s own body is characterized by separateness is the very same as the fact
                        that the bodies of all sentient beings are characterized by separateness. <ref cRef="F.136.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3074"/> He understands the fact that the bodies of all sentient beings are characterized by

                        fact that the totality of phenomena is characterized by separateness is the same as the fact that all phenomena are
                        characterized by separateness. This is because there are no internal phenomena that can be established. He realizes that the
                        suchness of his own body is the suchness of the bodies of sentient beings, and he realizes that the suchness of the body of
                        all sentient beings is the suchness of his own body. He realizes that the suchness of his own body is the suchness of all the
                        buddhas, and he realizes that the suchness of all the buddhas is the suchness of his own body. [MS.104.a] He realizes that the

                            to the more philosophically minded, the title Tathāgata was also understood as “the one who has attained, or understood,
                            suchness,” according to the scholastic commentary traditions of Buddhism. In the following the text develops the idea of
                            the Tathāgata by playing on the double meaning of the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vigraha</foreign>,
                            namely “multiplicity” and “body.” The bodhisatva displays this suchness through the multiplicity of his bodily existence
                            for the sake of all beings.</note> Therefore, the very embodiment of suchness is what is meant by the embodiment of the
                        tathāgata. Such an embodiment is an all-encompassing embodiment. The bodhisatva displays everything as being embodied, but he
                        does not make the tathāgata into something that is embodied, and being unembodied and undisputed, he displays all embodied
                        forms while not infringing upon the embodiment of the tathāgata. Through the knowledge of the tathāgata he discerns the
                        embodiment of a tathāgata. Through the sameness of a tathāgata body he discerns the sameness of his own body. Through the
                        sameness of his own body he discerns the sameness of all things embodied and all things not embodied. Through the sameness of
                        all things embodied and not embodied he sees the final lack of any body. This is the understanding of the dependently

                        becomes the Dharma body himself, and he no longer has a body consisting of skandhas, elements, and sense fields. Someone who

                        hatred. He truly knows that a mind free from hatred is a mind free from hatred. He truly knows that a mind filled with
                        delusion is a mind filled with delusion. He truly knows that a mind free from delusion is a mind free from delusion. In this
                        way, Śāriputra, he knows what corruptions any particular sentient being is filled with, and because he knows this, he is able
                        to teach them the Dharma in such a way as to rid them of their vices. When he approaches an assembly, he first examines the
                        assembly carefully. When he has examined it carefully, he teaches the Dharma to those sentient beings in whatever way is most
                        suitable for them. In this way, Śāriputra, he knows the faculties, superior and inferior, of all those sentient beings. The
                        bodhisatva, though, does not give priority to his own thoughts, nor does he give priority to the thoughts of others. Why is
                        this? It is because the bodhisatva knows that his stream of thoughts possesses knowledge. He knows that his stream of thoughts
                        possesses mindfulness. <ref cRef="F.149.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3099"/> [MS.111.a] He knows that his stream of

                        possesses intelligence. He knows that his stream of thoughts is free from the vices and that any connection to habitual

                        beings. In this way, Śāriputra, he penetrates the knowledge of thoughts among the various kinds of phenomena. This is what is

                        of family. They looked like this, had these genders, and were in these kinds of physical condition. They had these kinds of

                        they passed away again they took birth here.’ In this way, he recollects the details and the locations of the multitude of his
                        own various previous states of existence and those of all sentient beings. He recollects his own previous states of existence
                        from the very beginning of time. He recollects the previous states of existence of other sentient beings, of other people,
                        from the very beginning of time. He also recollects the previous causes of his own roots of virtue, and he recollects others’
                        roots of virtue. He develops his own roots of virtue and his own awakening, and when he recollects other sentient beings’
                        roots of virtue, he cultivates the mind of awakening. He turns his attention to those causes of happiness and suffering in
                        previous states of existence that arose because of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self. When he has turned his
                        attention to the fact that they arose because of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self, he does not become
                        intoxicated by forms. He does not become intoxicated by pleasure. He does not become intoxicated by having followers. He does
                        not become intoxicated by lordship. He does not become intoxicated by the craving to become a king of the entire world. He

                        craving for all kinds of sensual pleasures or the happiness of kingship or lordship. He does not take hold of existence,
                        except for the purpose of bringing sentient beings to maturity, and only after careful consideration. Because he has already
                        turned his attention to impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self, his conscience and moral sensitivity are disturbed by
                        the actions he has performed because of the vices, and he is repulsed by them. <ref cRef="F.150.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3101"/> By means of the state of things that is connected to the present, he acted in ways that

                        unsurpassed perfect awakening to flourish. [MS.111.b] Because of all the present roots of virtue he has gathered, he avoids
                        dishonesty and deception. So that the lineage of the Buddha, the lineage of the Dharma, and the lineage of the Saṅgha are not
                        destroyed, he develops omniscience. The foundation of his memory is good because he possesses the power of memory and because
                        of the presence of the totality of phenomena in his memory. Because he understands things well, his memory is unshakeable.
                        Because of his conscientious practice of meditation, it is not hurried. Because his foundation of calm abiding meditation is
                        good, it is not rushed. Because he has a good grasp of insight meditation, it is not agitated. Because he sees clearly, it is

                        of ornaments to the essence of awakening. This is his skillful means. He meditates from the perspective of the pacification of
                        the vices. This is his wisdom. While in this state, he makes the setting in motion of the wheel of the Dharma his aim. This is
                        his skillful means. He meditates from the perspective of the fact that nothing is set in motion and no motion is obstructed.
                        This is his wisdom. While in this state, he looks upon the factors of awakening and manifests them to the extent to which they
                        have been cultivated. This is his skillful means. He meditates by way of meditation and nonmeditation, seeing that as many
                        secondary vices as there may be, they are free from all things related to the happiness beyond burning desire, the wisdom and
                        concentration of the Tathāgata; they are complete knowledge that is unattached to perception and nonperception; they are the
                        removal of all kinds of perceptions; and they conform to the destiny of all bodhisatvas. This is his wisdom. This is what the
                        imperishable perfection of meditation of bodhisatvas, great beings, who practice in this way is like. No māras are able to
                        obstruct them, and they tend to the vessel of the qualities of all the buddhas. This, Śāriputra, is what his skillful means
                        are like, and this is what his wisdom is like. This is the perfection of meditation of bodhisatvas, which leads to wisdom and
                        skillful means.</p>

                        his superior abilities, he is able to view the mental activity of all sentient beings because he can see and discern their
                        essential nature. With his superior abilities, he is able to recollect all eons because he is able to perceive the past and
                        the future. With his superior abilities, he is able to display transformations that are characterized by being creations that

                        transcendental and lead to insight [MS.113.b] into all phenomena. His superior abilities cannot easily be fathomed by śrāvakas
                        and pratyekabuddhas. His superior abilities have a profound purpose. They are the enemies of Māra, and they destroy him. His
                        superior abilities retain the essence of awakening and are entrusted to the realization of all the qualities of a buddha. His

                        attains power over all phenomena. In this way, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva performs actions with knowledge, and not with

                        spotless, free from the secondary vices, well disciplined, completely calm, and well prepared, a mind that has attained
                        meditation, liberation, and concentration, he intentionally takes birth but is not bound by birth, is not bound by death, and
                        is not bound by rebirth. Why is this? It is because he is liberated from making false assumptions, liberated from being bound
                        by all the vices, liberated from relying on any wrong views. Therefore, he is liberated in birth, liberated in death, and
                        liberated in rebirth. When he is reborn, he does not stray from the Mahāyāna but perfects the qualities of the buddhas. He
                        obtains the qualities of the buddhas by searching for them in the ten directions, but he does not seize hold of them. He
                        approaches all phenomena as the qualities of the buddhas. In this way, all the buddha-qualities and all phenomena are said to
                        be neither qualities nor nonqualities. The qualities that he truly searches for cannot be obtained, because they are
                        uncountable. The totality of phenomena entirely surpasses any kind of measurement. He knows the sameness of all phenomena, and
                        he is not attached to either qualities or nonqualities. Indeed, his goal is to not be attached to any qualities. If one is
                        conceited about one’s aim, that can be very damaging. But if one is not conceited about one’s goal, it stands before one as
                        neither a goal nor a nongoal. When he sees the aim, his intellect is not hindered in any way. Someone whose intellect is not

                        does not grasp is unattached. Someone who is unattached is not stuck. Someone who is not stuck is not faulty. Someone who is

                        like someone who holds the whole of space in the palm of his hand. Someone who holds the whole of space in the palm of his
                        hand is not involved with the realm of sensual desire. He is not involved with the realm of form. He is not involved with the

                        This is what his awakening is like, and his insight is like his awakening. [MS.114.a] Why are his awakening and his insight
                        said to be like this? There is no phenomenon, not even a phenomenon as small as an atom, that he obtains, that he needs to
                        awaken to, or that he needs to realize. This is why his awakening and his insight are said to be like this. Thus, the

                        with a mind free from essential characteristics. He adorns the seat of awakening, with a mind that rests on the seat of the
                        three realms. He defeats Māra, with a mind that shows kindness to all sentient beings. He is awakened, as he has awoken to the
                        inherent nature of all phenomena. He sets the wheel of the Dharma in motion, with a mind that cannot be stopped. He manifests

                        will be able to leave these phenomena behind. This is what is impossible. Even those who are adept at non-grasping have some
                        doubts with regard to their insight into phenomena, and so those who continue to hold on to phenomena will certainly have such
                        doubts. Therefore, by not grasping at any phenomena, insight progresses.</p>

                        this context? What are non-superficial words? The bodhisatva applies himself in a way that is not superficial as follows: He
                        applies himself to gaining stability in calm abiding meditation, and he applies himself to analysis in insight meditation.
                        This is what it means to apply oneself in a way that is not superficial. He applies himself with his body secluded and his
                        mind delighted. He applies himself to the fact that there is no annihilation, and to the fact that there is no permanence. He
                        applies himself to causes and conditions, and to dependent origination. He applies himself to the fact that there is no being,
                        no life force, and no person, and to the fact that there is no coming, no going, and no remaining. He applies himself to the
                        fact that there is no transference, the fact that causes and effects are inconsequential, and to the investigation of the
                        emptiness of causes. He applies himself to the investigation of freedom from attributes, and to the investigation of freedom
                        from aspirations. He does not, however, reify emptiness, freedom from attributes, and freedom from aspirations. He applies
                        himself to the attainments of concentration, but he does not become involved in the kind of birth that comes about through the
                        power of concentrations. He applies himself to gaining knowledge related to the superior abilities, but he does not become
                        entangled in eliminating the defilements. He applies himself to examining nonbirth, but he does not end up on a fixed course.
                        He applies himself to examining the fact that no sentient beings have a self, but he does not end up losing his great
                        compassion. He maintains the perspective that all kinds of birth are terrifying, but he still takes unimaginably many
                        existences upon himself. He does not give up his yearning for nirvāṇa, but he does not reify the Dharma. He remains
                        indifferent to the delights of sensual pleasures, but he does not disregard the joys of the Dharma. <ref cRef="F.163.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3128"/> He renounces deliberation, which only proliferates itself, but he does not

                        mind. Still, when the mind is brought under the influence of the Buddha, something has been accomplished.’ This, Śāriputra, is
                        how the bodhisatva practices the foundation of mindfulness of the mind by observing the mind. As he dwells on the mind and
                        observes the mind, he steers his mind so that he attains the superior abilities. When he has attained the superior abilities,
                        he is able to know all minds by means of one mind, and with this knowledge he teaches the Dharma of the true nature of the
                        mind.</p>

                        compassion. When he has attained great compassion, he will not tire until all sentient beings have been brought to maturity.
                        As he dwells on the mind and observes the mind, he does not maintain an attitude of wanting to eliminate the mind, of wanting
                        to shut the mind off, <ref cRef="F.180.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3161"/> but instead he develops a desire to
                        relate to the workings of cyclic existence. With the knowledge that comes from paying attention to the mind, he arrives at
                        certainty about the fact that there is no birth and no origination, and dwelling in the Dharma in this way, he does not fall
                        to the level of a śrāvaka or a pratyekabuddha. There will still be some clinging to the stream of thoughts as long as he has
                        not developed all the qualities of a buddha, but with the wisdom that arises in that one moment when these qualities are
                        present, unsurpassed perfect awakening is attained. This, Śāriputra, is how the bodhisatva practices the foundation of

                        Śāriputra, the bodhisatva sees phenomena with the wisdom eye of the noble ones, and he does not become confused by them, even
                        temporarily, while on his way to the seat of awakening. When he dwells observing phenomena in this way, he does not perceive
                        any phenomena, however small, that escape emptiness, that escape freedom from attributes, that escape freedom from
                        aspirations, that escape freedom from origination, that escape freedom from arising, that escape freedom from being
                        conditioned, or that escape freedom from an entity. He does not perceive any phenomena, however small, that escape dependent
                        origination. When he dwells in this observation of phenomena, the bodhisatva perceives truth, and not untruth.</p>

                    <p tid="1894">“What is truth? It is the fact that there is no self, no being, no life force, and no person. This is what is known
                        as <distinct>truth</distinct>. What is untruth? It is the view that there is a self, a being, a life force, or a person. It is
                        the view of annihilation, the view of permanence, the view of existence, and the view of nonexistence. This is what is known
                        as <distinct>untruth</distinct>. Thus, Śāriputra, all phenomena are true, <ref cRef="F.180.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3162"/> and all phenomena are untrue. How so? When one understands emptiness, freedom from
                        attributes, and freedom from aspirations all phenomena are true. If one tends to think in terms of <distinct>me</distinct> and
                            <distinct>mine</distinct>, all phenomena are untrue. When the bodhisatva dwells on phenomena and observes phenomena, he
                        does not perceive any phenomena [MS.128.b] that are anything other than the qualities of the Buddha, that do not lead to
                        awakening, that do not lead to buddhahood, that do not lead to the path, that do not lead to liberation, and that do not lead
                        to release. Because he sees all phenomena as release, he attains the kind of great compassion that is called
                            <distinct>unhindered</distinct>. He comes to the conclusion that the corruptions of all sentient beings are made up. He
                        reflects, ‘They are not connected with the vices—they are beyond the vices.’ How so? Because they genuinely engage with the
                        explicit meaning of things, they do not accumulate the vices, they do not heap them up, and awakening comes about through this
                        realization. The true nature of vices is the true nature of awakening, and the true nature of awakening is the true nature of
                        vices. If one bears in mind that this is the way things are, then one does not, in fact, keep focus or place one’s mindfulness
                        on anything at all. This is the very state of knowing the way things actually are, and this is why the totality of phenomena
                        is referred to as <distinct>the very state of things</distinct>. The constant state of the totality of phenomena is the
                        constant state of the element of beings, and the constant state of the element of beings is the constant state of the element
                        of space. This is why it can be said that all phenomena are like space. The bodhisatva who dwells on phenomena and observes
                        phenomena relies upon the truth of the Buddha, and in this he is in fact relating to all phenomena as the truth of the Buddha.
                        He develops the knowledge of destruction, but he does not attain the destruction of the unconditioned. <ref cRef="F.181.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-040-007-3163"/> He attains the knowledge of nonarising, but he still takes birth because of
                        his concern for sentient beings, while not abandoning his ultimate goal of nonbirth. </p>

                        the purpose of the perfections. Also, fully perfecting the knowledge of omniscience is the purpose of the perfections. Not
                        being attached to the conditioned or the unconditioned is the purpose of the perfections. Gaining an understanding of the
                        shortcomings of cyclic existence is the purpose of the perfections. Revealing the inexhaustible treasury of the teachings is
                        the purpose of the perfections. Fully perfecting unobstructed liberation is the purpose of the perfections. Recognizing the
                        sameness of generosity, morality, patient acceptance, vigor, meditation, and wisdom is the purpose of the perfections. Skill
                        in discerning things is the purpose of the perfections. Operating within all the realms of sentient beings is the purpose of
                        the perfections. Fully perfecting one’s patient acceptance of the fact that phenomena do not arise is the purpose of the
                        perfections. Fully perfecting the stage of irreversibility is the purpose of the perfections. Fully accomplishing buddha
                        fields is the purpose of the perfections. Bringing sentient beings to maturity is the purpose of the perfections. The actual
                        attainment of the seat of awakening is the purpose of the perfections. Completely overcoming all māras is the purpose of the
                        perfections. Fully developing the complete qualities of a buddha is the purpose of the perfections. Moreover, furthering the
