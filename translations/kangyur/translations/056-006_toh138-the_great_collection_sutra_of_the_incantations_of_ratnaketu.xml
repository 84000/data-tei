                    <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> is one of the core texts
          of the Mahāsannipāta collection of Mahāyāna sūtras that dates back to the formative period
          of Mahāyāna Buddhism, from the first to the third century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>.
          Its rich and varied narratives, likely redacted from at least two independent works,
          recount significant events from the lives, past and present, of Buddha Śākyamuni and some
          of his main followers and opponents, both human and nonhuman. At the centre of these
          narratives is the climactic episode from the Buddha’s life when Māra, the personification
          of spiritual death, sets out to destroy the Buddha and his Dharma. The mythic
          confrontation between these paragons of light and darkness, and the Buddha’s eventual
          victory, are related in vivid detail. As is common with Mahāyāna sūtras, the main
          narratives are frequently interwoven with Dharma instructions and interspersed with
          magical events. The text exemplifies two distinctive sūtra genres, “prophecies” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa)</foreign> and “incantations” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī)</foreign>, as it includes, respectively,
          prophecies of the future attainment of buddhahood by some of the Buddha’s followers, and
          the magical formulae that are meant to ensure the survival of the Buddha’s teachings and
          the prosperity of its practitioners. </p>

                    <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> presents the dramatic
          events in the life of the Buddha when Māra attempts to destroy the Buddha, break up the
          Saṅgha, and annihilate the Dharma, a struggle from which the Buddha eventually emerges
          victorious. This epic confrontation is told with tremendous verve and poignancy, and
          features characters, dialogue, and plot twists that rank amongst the best in Buddhist
          literature. The narrative starts with its own version of the well-known story of the
          conversion of two of the Buddha’s most prominent early disciples, Śāriputra and
          Maudgalyāyana, and is soon embellished with quaint stories from the past lives of some of
          the characters, ranging from well-known buddha figures, down to (at one time) ordinary
          human and nonhuman beings. The parts of the narrative that unfold on earth are centered
          around the city of Rājagṛha, the capital of Magadha. It provides some interesting insight
          into the everyday life of India at the time, with its division into secular and religious
          members of society, and vividly captures the experiences that Buddhist monks might have
          had when doing their daily alms-rounds in the city streets. This is interspersed with
          lively dialogue which is at once didactic and aesthetically captivating. Especially moving
          is the conversation that Māra has with his children, when the daughters try to console
          their distraught father who bitterly despairs over the impending loss of his realm and the
          humiliation of seeing his minions, even his own children, desert him, with all the pathos
          of a broken old man and all the obduracy of a petulant child.</p>

                    <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> is part of a large body
          of Mahāyāna sūtras called the Great Collection (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta)</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta</foreign> can be translated either as “Great Collection” or “Great
          Assembly,” a semantic ambivalence that may have be intentional given the predilection for
          punning among the Sanskrit literati. The latter connotation reflects a feature shared by
          the sūtras in this collection, namely, that the discourse contained in each of them is
          always delivered to a “great assembly” of infinite numbers of beings who have congregated
          to hear the teaching, and typically begins, “Blessed Śākyamuni, at that time, directed his
          gaze at the “great assembly.” According to Jens Braarvig (Braarvig 1993), the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta</foreign> was compiled in the first
          centuries of the common era during the formative period of the Mahāyāna canon. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title>, being part of the original core of this collection,
          must therefore have already existed by then. </p>

        <p tid="11">The text of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> extant today is
          available in the original Sanskrit, which is incomplete, and in the Tibetan canonical
          translation. The English translation presented here has been prepared from the incomplete
          Sanskrit text as critically edited by Kurumiya (Kurumiya 1978). Lacunae and missing
          sections were supplied from the Tibetan Degé translation. These lacunae vary in length
          from individual syllables to several lines of text, while folios are missing in blocks,
          from a single folio to a few, in various parts of the text. The parts translated from the
          Sanskrit—about two thirds of the text—were subsequently checked against and edited based
          on the Degé and other Tibetan Kangyur editions. The beginning and end of each section were
          translated entirely from the Tibetan, as indicated in the notes. </p>

        <p tid="12">The colophon to the Tibetan translation, which is found in all major recensions
          of the Tibetan Buddhist Kangyur, states that it was produced by the Indian scholar
          Śīlendrabodhi and the Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé. The text is also recorded in the

          imperial translations, so we can establish that it was first translated from Sanskrit into
          Tibetan no later than the early ninth century, as the Denkarma is dated to 812 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Apart from the Tibetan canonical translation, other Tibetan
          translations have been found in manuscript form in the Dunhuang caves. There are also two
          Chinese translations. Most of the Tibetan and one of the Chinese translations were
          included by Kurumiya in his Sanskrit and Tibetan editions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> (Kurumiya 1978 and Kurumiya 1979, respectively). The primary Tibetan
          text used for the present translation was the Degé (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sde
            dge</foreign>) edition, but the other editions included in the Comparative Kangyur
            (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>) were also consulted.</p>

        <p tid="13">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> shares much of its character and
          some of its themes with other sūtras, and, like most sūtras of the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta</foreign>, has left a rich legacy in the
          antecedent Buddhist literature. It is quoted or referred to in a number of texts, either
          as a whole text or as its eponymous dhāraṇī, not least because of its salient theme of
          changing the female gender into male by means of the dhāraṇī. One such text is the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa</title>, which recommends, in one of its rituals,
          the recitation of the text. One of the important mantras there is the heart essence of the
          buddha Ratnaketu (who seems to be an emanation of Mañjuśrī). This buddha is also part of
          the maṇḍala retinue of Mañjuśrī. He and the dhāraṇī goddess called Ratnaketu are also
          members of the large audience attending the original delivery of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa</title>.</p>
        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-10"/>
        <p tid="14">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> represents a mixture of genres.
          In the most general classification, it is a Mahāyāna sūtra, a discourse traditionally
          attributed to the Buddha that elaborates, through narratives and teachings, the basic
          Mahāyāna themes of altruism, morality, emptiness, selflessness, and the bodhisattva path
          to awakening. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sūtra</foreign> may be
          applied to individual sūtras, to some sūtra collections, such as the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta</foreign>, and to the totality of sūtra
          literature. The more specific genres that the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title>
          exemplifies, such as incantation (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign>) and
          exposition (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vyākaraṇa</foreign>), are subdivisions of the sūtra
          genre. </p>
        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-11"/>
        <p tid="15">It is worth noting some of the salient features of these two genres as they are
          reflected in this text. The dhāraṇī genre, found in both the sūtra and tantra literature,
          is characterized by the presence of magical formulae which are held to play a critical
          role in promoting and preserving the Buddhist teachings. The word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> derives from the root √<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhṛ</foreign> (to “hold,” “support,” “contain,”
          “retain,”or “remember”). The sense of <distinct>containing</distinct> could be applied to
          both the formula, which magically “contains” a certain quality, or qualities, and also the
          person who has obtained this dhāraṇī formula or seal. Once she or he has obtained it, as
          mentioned before, they become “sealed” or “stamped” with whatever quality the dhāraṇī
          contains, and subsequently have the power to activate this quality or invoke the
          corresponding buddha activity. One thing a dhāraṇī is always a vehicle for—whether this is
          implied by the literal meaning of the term or not—is the blessing of the buddhas and the
          magical power sealed therein. Although the sūtras and commentaries like to dwell on the
          dhāraṇī-powers of retaining things in memory (probably to account for the literal meaning
          of “containing”), dhāraṇīs can open the door to innumerable other qualities, such as
          loving kindness, compassion, and so forth, and invoke any kind of activity. The main
          function of the Ratnaketu dhāraṇī, for example, is to purify the karma of being reborn as
          a woman and ensure a male birth; the power of this dhāraṇī is so great that it can even
          cause the instant transformation of a female body into a male one. The function of the
          second most important dhāraṇī in the Ratnaketu, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samucchrayavidhvaṃsanī</foreign> (“terminator of birth”), is to terminate the embodied
          rebirth in saṃsāra.’</p>
        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-12"/>
        <p tid="16">The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> is
          frequently paired in the sūtra literature with other terms, such as “door” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">praveśa</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mukha</foreign>) or “seal”
            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mudrā</foreign>). As a magical formula, a
          dhāraṇī constitutes the door to the infinite qualities of buddhahood, buddhahood itself,
          or the different types of buddha activity. Just as such qualities are innumerable, so are
          the dhāraṇī-doors. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra</title> (Lamotte
          2001, pp. 1541–2) explains what a dhāraṇī-door is by bringing out the difference between
          “dhāraṇī-door” and “samādhi-door.” Just as a samādhi-door may allow access to any desired
          quality or magical power, so too can a dhāraṇī-door. The difference is that while the
          meditative absorption (samādhi) comes and goes, the incantation (dhāraṇī) never leaves
          those who have “obtained” it, following them like a shadow from life to life. This is
          because, when realizing or “obtaining” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratilābha</foreign>) a dhāraṇī, one becomes “sealed” or “stamped” with it—hence a
          dhāraṇī is also called a “dhāraṇī-seal.”</p>
        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-13"/>
        <p tid="17">The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign> (from

          taking something apart and means a clear analysis or detailed presentation and has been
          translated throughout this text as “exposition.” The term also denotes a prophecy by the
          Buddha of a particular person or being attaining buddhahood, and, by extension, also a
          text containing such prophecies. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title>, this
          term is probably used in both meanings (“exposition” and “text containing prophecies”) at
          once. What is unique to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> is the feminine

        <p tid="18">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> also contains another important
          trope characteristic of its particular blend of genres, namely the stories of the former
          lives (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign>) of the Buddha and his
          disciples. This element is pervasive in Mahāyāna sūtras, and also developed into a
          distinct genre, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātaka</foreign> stories, that
          are entirely dedicated to recounting the former lives of the Buddha as exemplary models of

          (the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta</foreign>), the text itself
          consists of sections that may have originally been at least two separate sūtras. The first
          one, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu </title>proper, is centered around its
          eponymous dhāraṇī. It has its own consistent narrative with the same characters appearing
          all throughout. It may be noted that portions of this section find parallels in other
          sūtras. For instance, the account of the meeting between the two mendicants Aśvajit and
          Upatiṣya, wherein the latter learns of the former’s conversion to Buddhism, is to be found
          in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pravrajyāvastu</title> chapter of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>

            Kaulita (Śāriputra and Maudgalyayana), but the culmination of their story in their
            encounter with Aśvajit and meeting the Buddha is related in the present text with a
            little more detail, including some verses of which the Vinayavastu account has much
            briefer equivalents. The main additional element in the story in the present version—the
            advent of Māra following that meeting with Aśvajit—is of course the narrative theme that
            ties together all the component parts of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title>.</note> This section extends as far as the latter part of chapter 5,
          at which point another dhāraṇī, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samucchrayavidhvaṃsanī</foreign> (“terminator of birth”), becomes the main focus of the
          text. The latter dhāraṇī also has a large section devoted to it. Within this section, the
          whole text is consistently referred to by the name of the dhāraṇī, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Samucchrayavidhvaṃsanī</foreign>, thus raising the
          possibility that this section once formed an independent work. This hypothesis if further
          supported by the fact that the name <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> is never
          used after the end of the first four and a half chapters, except in chapter colophons and
          the final dedication of merit. Furthermore, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Samucchrayavidhvaṃsanī</foreign> section marks a change in the narrative, introducing
          new characters and stories, and it also introduces new terminology unique to this section.
          The continuing use of the name <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> in the chapter
          colophons might have been an attempt on the part of the redactors to give compositional

          philosophy and practice, and (3) the magic. Magic figures prominently in each of the

          perform their supernatural deeds. Magic is also “sealed” in the magical formulae of the
          dhāraṇīs. Ultimately, though, there can be no distinction between these two types of
          magic, as the miraculous feats and the awesome power of the dhāraṇīs are inextricably
          linked—the feats are the buddha activity manifesting itself, and the dhāraṇīs are the

            not move and cannot be placed anywhere, the qualities of buddhahood are not material or
            entities, and have no characteristics. Because they transcend verbal description, the
