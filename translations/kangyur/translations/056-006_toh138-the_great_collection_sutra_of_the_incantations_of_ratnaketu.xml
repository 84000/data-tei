                    <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> is one of the core texts
          of the Mahāsannipāta collection of Mahāyāna sūtras that dates back to the formative period
          of Mahāyāna Buddhism, from the first to the third century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>.
          Its rich and varied narratives, probably redacted from at least two independent works,
          recount significant events from the lives, past and present, of the Buddha Śākyamuni and
          some of his main followers and opponents, both human and nonhuman. At the center of these
          narratives is the climactic episode from the Buddha’s life when <term>Māra</term>, the
          personification of spiritual death, sets out to destroy the Buddha and his Dharma. The
          mythic confrontation between these paragons of light and darkness, and the Buddha’s
          eventual victory, are related in vivid detail. The main
          narratives are interwoven with Dharma instructions and interspersed with
          miraculous events. The text also exemplifies two distinctive sūtra genres, “prophecies” 
          (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign>) and “incantations” 
          (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign>), as it includes, respectively,
          prophecies of the future attainment of buddhahood by some of the Buddha’s followers and
          the potent phrases that embody the Buddha’s teachings and are meant to ensure their survival and
          the thriving of its practitioners.</p>

                    <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> presents the dramatic
          events in the life of the Buddha when <term>Māra</term> attempts to destroy the Buddha,
          break up the Saṅgha, and annihilate the Dharma, a struggle from which the Buddha
          eventually emerges <term type="ignore">victorious</term>. This epic confrontation is told
          with tremendous verve and poignancy, and features characters, dialogue, and plot twists
          that rank among the best in Buddhist literature. The narrative starts with its own
          version of the well-known story of the conversion of two of the Buddha’s most prominent
          early disciples, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, and is soon embellished with quaint stories
          from the past lives of some of the characters, ranging from well-known buddha figures down
          to (at one time) ordinary human and nonhuman beings. The parts of the narrative that
          unfold on <term type="ignore">earth</term> are centered around the city of Rājagṛha, the
          capital of Magadha. They provide some interesting insight into the everyday life of India
          at the time, with its division into secular and religious members of society, and vividly
          capture the experiences that Buddhist monks might have had when going on their daily
          alms-rounds in the city streets. This is interspersed with lively dialogue that is at once
          didactic and aesthetically captivating. Especially moving is the conversation that
            <term>Māra</term> has with his children, when the daughters try to console their
          distraught father, who bitterly despairs over the impending loss of his realm and the
          humiliation of seeing his minions, even his own children, desert him, with all the pathos
          of a broken old man and all the obduracy of a petulant child.</p>

                    <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> is part of a large body
          of Mahāyāna sūtras called the Great Collection (Mahāsannipāta). <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāsannipāta</foreign> can be translated either as “Great Collection” or
          “Great Assembly,” a semantic ambivalence that may have been intentional given the
          predilection for punning among the Sanskrit literati. The latter connotation reflects a
          feature shared by the sūtras in this collection, namely, that the discourse contained in
          each of them is always delivered to a “great assembly” of infinite numbers of beings who
          have congregated to hear the teaching, and typically begins, “Blessed Śākyamuni, at that
          time, directed his gaze at the great assembly.” According to Jens Braarvig,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-1869" index="1">Braarvig 1993.</note> the
          Mahāsannipāta was compiled in the first centuries of the common era during the formative

          from individual syllables to several lines of text, while folios are missing in blocks,
          from a single folio to a few, in various parts of the text. The parts translated from the
          Sanskrit—about two thirds of the text—were subsequently checked against and edited based
          on the Degé and other Tibetan Kangyur editions. The beginning and end of each section were

          Tibetan no later than the early ninth century, as the Denkarma is dated to 812 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Apart from the Tibetan canonical translation, other Tibetan
          translations have been found in manuscript form in the Dunhuang caves.<note place="end" index="5" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-1877">Interestingly, 
            the catalog of the Narthang Kangyur records the tradition that The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī was first 
            translated into Tibetan by Tönmi Sambhoṭa (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">thon mi sam+b+ho Ta</foreign>), the legendary seventh century 
            minister and scholar credited with the development of the Tibetan alphabet during the reign of

          </note> There are also two
          Chinese translations. Most of the Tibetan and one of the Chinese translations were
          included by Kurumiya in his Sanskrit and Tibetan editions of <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> (Kurumiya 1978 and Kurumiya 1979, respectively). The primary
          Tibetan text used for the present translation was the Degé edition, but the other editions included in the Comparative Edition

                    <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> shares much of its
          character and some of its themes with other sūtras and, like most sūtras of the
          Mahāsannipāta, has left a rich legacy in the subsequent Buddhist literature. It is quoted
          or referred to in a number of texts, either as a whole text or as its eponymous dhāraṇī,
          not least because of its salient theme of changing the female gender into male by means of

          recitation of the text. One of the important mantras there is the heart essence of the

          the maṇḍala retinue of Mañjuśrī. He and the dhāraṇī goddess called Ratnaketu are also

          genres. In the most general classification, it is a Mahāyāna sūtra, a discourse
          traditionally attributed to the Buddha that elaborates, through narratives and teachings,
          the basic Mahāyāna themes of altruism, morality, emptiness, selflessness, and the
          bodhisattva path to awakening. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sūtra</foreign> may be applied to individual sūtras, to some sūtra collections such as
          the Mahāsannipāta, and to the totality of sūtra literature. The more specific genres that
            <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> exemplifies, such as incantation
            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇī</foreign>) and exposition (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vyākaraṇa</foreign>), are subdivisions of the sūtra genre. </p>
        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-11"/>
        <p tid="15">It is worth noting some of the salient features of these two genres as they are
          reflected in this text. The dhāraṇī genre, found in both the sūtra and tantra literature,
          is characterized by the presence of magical formulae that are held to play a critical role
          in promoting and preserving the Buddhist teachings. The word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> derives from the root √<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhṛ</foreign> (to “hold,” “support,” “contain,” “retain,” or “remember”).
          The sense of <distinct>containing</distinct> could be applied to both the formula, which
          magically “contains” a certain quality or qualities, and also the person who has obtained
          this dhāraṇī formula or seal. Once they have obtained it, they become
          “sealed” or “stamped” with whatever quality the dhāraṇī contains, and they subsequently
          have the power to activate this quality or invoke the corresponding buddha activity. One
          thing a dhāraṇī is always a vehicle for—whether this is implied by the literal meaning of
          the term or not—is the blessing of the buddhas and the magical power sealed therein.
          Although the sūtras and commentaries like to dwell on the dhāraṇī-powers of retaining
          things in memory (probably to account for the literal meaning of “containing”), dhāraṇīs
          can open the door to innumerable other qualities, such as loving kindness, compassion, and
          so forth, and invoke any kind of activity. The main function of the Ratnaketu dhāraṇī, for
          example, is to purify the karma of being reborn as a woman and ensure a male birth; the
          power of this dhāraṇī is so great that it can even cause the instant transformation of a
          female body into a male one. The function of the second most important dhāraṇī in the
          Ratnaketu, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samucchraya­vidhvaṃsanī</foreign>
          (“terminator of birth”), is to terminate embodied rebirth in saṃsāra.</p>
        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-12"/>
        <p tid="16">The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> is frequently
          paired in the sūtra literature with other terms, such as “door” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">praveśa</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mukha</foreign>) or “seal” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mudrā</foreign>). As a magical formula, a dhāraṇī constitutes the door to the infinite
          qualities of buddhahood, buddhahood itself, or the different types of buddha activity.
          Just as such qualities are innumerable, so are the dhāraṇī-doors. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñā­pāramitā­śāstra</title>
                    <note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-1871" index="6">Lamotte 2001, pp. 1541–42.</note> explains what
          a dhāraṇī-door is by bringing out the difference between “dhāraṇī-door” and
          “samādhi-door.” Just as a samādhi-door may allow access to any desired quality or magical
          power, so too can a dhāraṇī-door. The difference is that while the meditative absorption
          (samādhi) comes and goes, the incantation (dhāraṇī) never leaves those who have “obtained”
          it, following them like a shadow from life to life. This is because, when realizing or
          “obtaining” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratilābha</foreign>) a dhāraṇī, one
          becomes “sealed” or “stamped” with it—hence a dhāraṇī is also called a “dhāraṇī-seal.”</p>

        <p tid="17">The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign> (from

          taking something apart and means a clear analysis or detailed presentation, and it has
          been translated throughout this text as “exposition.” The term also denotes a prophecy by
          the Buddha of a particular person or being attaining buddhahood, and, by extension, also a
          text containing such prophecies. In <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title>, this term is probably used with both meanings (“exposition” and “text

          Buddha and his disciples. This <term type="ignore">element</term> is pervasive in Mahāyāna sūtras and also developed

        <p tid="19">Just as <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> is part of a
          larger sūtra (the Mahāsannipāta), the text itself consists of sections that may have
          originally been at least two separate sūtras. The first one, <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title> proper, is centered around its eponymous dhāraṇī. It has its
          own consistent narrative with the same characters appearing throughout. It may be
          noted that portions of this section find parallels in other canonical texts. For instance, the
          account of the meeting between the two mendicants Aśvajit and Upatiṣya, wherein the latter
          learns of the former’s conversion to Buddhism, is to be found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pravrajyāvastu</title> chapter of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-056-006-17" index="8">

            their story in their encounter with Aśvajit and meeting with the Buddha is related in
            the present text with a little more detail, including some verses of which the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> account has much briefer equivalents. The main
            additional <term type="ignore">element</term> in the story in the present version—the advent of <term>Māra</term>
            following that meeting with Aśvajit—is of course the narrative theme that ties together
            all the component parts of <title xml:lang="en">The Ratnaketu Dhāraṇī</title>.</note> This section extends as far as the latter part of chapter 5, at
          which point another dhāraṇī, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samucchraya­vidhvaṃsanī</foreign> (“terminator of birth”), becomes the main focus of
          the text. The latter dhāraṇī also has a large section devoted to it. Within this section,
          the whole text is consistently referred to by the name of the dhāraṇī, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Samucchraya­vidhvaṃsanī</foreign>, thus raising the
          possibility that this section once formed an independent work. This hypothesis is further
          supported by the fact that the name <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> is never
          used after the end of the first four and a half chapters, except in chapter colophons and
          the final dedication of merit. Furthermore, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Samucchraya­vidhvaṃsanī</foreign> section marks a change in the narrative, introducing
          new characters and stories, and it also introduces new terminology unique to this section.
          The continuing use of the name <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnaketu</title> in the chapter
          colophons might have been an attempt on the part of the redactors to give compositional
          integrity to the two (or three) texts presented as one.</p>

          or references to, the two main sections or their eponymous dhāraṇīs are made, suggesting,

          perform their supernatural deeds. Magic is also “sealed” in the magical formulae of the
          dhāraṇīs. Ultimately, though, there can be no distinction between these two types of
          magic, as the miraculous feats and the awesome power of the dhāraṇīs are inextricably
          linked—the feats are the buddha activity manifesting itself, and the dhāraṇīs are the
