                        bodhisattvas or hearers, as well as between bodhisattvas (see chapter 1). These dialogues deal
                        with both the theory and practice of the entire bodhisattva path. Narrative elements are
                        extremely limited in this teaching. However, a narrative pattern can be found in chapter 2 and
                        3, which begin with a story about a group of non-Buddhists (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tīrthika</foreign>s) or followers of the Buddha who have gathered to discuss a
                        difficult point regarding the nature of reality and cannot agree on anything. The main
                        protagonists then beg the Buddha to provide an explanation for the quandary these assemblies
                        cannot not resolve, or alternatively to explain his underlying intent when he expounded the
                        teachings that gave rise to conflicting interpretations. </p>

                    <p tid="14">Each chapter starts with a question on a topic requiring further elucidation: In the first
                        chapter, the bodhisattva Vidhivatparipṛcchaka questions the bodhisattva
                        Gambhīrārthasaṃdhinirmocana on the inexpressible (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anabhilāpya</foreign>) and nondual (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">advaya</foreign>) ultimate. In the second chapter, the bodhisattva Dharmodgata questions the
                        Buddha on the ultimate beyond speculation (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sarvatarkasamatikrānta</foreign>). In the third chapter, the bodhisattva Suviśuddhamati
                        questions the Buddha on the ultimate that is beyond being distinct or indistinct (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhedābhedasamatikrānta</foreign>) from conditioned phenomena.
                        In the fourth chapter, Subhūti questions the Buddha on the ultimate that is of a single nature
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ekarasa</foreign>) within all phenomena. In the
                        fifth chapter, the bodhisattva Viśālamati questions the Buddha on the secrets of mind (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">citta</foreign>), thought (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">manas</foreign>), and cognition (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñāna</foreign>). In the sixth chapter, the bodhisattva Guṇākara questions the Buddha on
                        the three defining characteristics (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">lakṣaṇa</foreign>) of
                        phenomena. In the seventh chapter, the bodhisattva Paramārthasamudgata questions the Buddha on
                        the three kinds of essencelessness (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niḥsvabhāvatā</foreign>) as well as on the Buddha’s three turnings of the Dharma wheel. In
                        the eighth chapter, the bodhisattva Maitreya questions the Buddha on the practice of mental
                        stillness (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śamatha</foreign>) and insight (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vipaśyanā</foreign>). In the ninth chapter, the bodhisattva
                        Avalokiteśvara questions the Buddha on the stages of the bodhisattva path and the Single Vehicle
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ekayāna</foreign>). In the tenth chapter, the
                        bodhisattva Mañjuśrī questions the Buddha on the bodies (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāya</foreign>) and activity of the tathāgatas.</p>

                        beings. All major Tibetan traditions consider chapter 3, focusing on the relation between the

                            nondual gnosis from mind’s elaborations, inexpressible reality from conventional
                            expressions, and the actual from the imaginary. The first chapter thus starts with the
                            distinction between conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, which became a prevalent theme
                            in the various Abhidharmas. Through this distinction, the point is made that the ultimate is
                            inexpressible and nondual. The realization of this inexpressible ultimate is achieved
                            through gnosis alone. Conceptions in terms of conditioned and unconditioned merely exist in
                            the way of a magical illusion. Yet, in order to lead beings to awakening, buddhas have to
                            use such labels. The second chapter elaborates on this very point. Although the ultimate is
                            beyond speculation, the Buddha taught liberation by means of verbal expressions and
                            conventions belonging to the domain of phenomenal appearances and notions. </p>

                        <p tid="19">As a consequence, the first two chapters delineate two domains corresponding to the two
                            truths (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">satyadvaya</foreign>): (1) the pure domain of
                            the ultimate, which, being inexpressible, nondual, and beyond speculation, is the realm of
                            nonconceptual gnosis free from conventional appearance and notions, and (2) the afflicted
                            domain of dualistic conventional expressions and notions, which is the realm of mental
                            elaborations. These domains are respectively labeled by the buddhas as “the unconditioned”
                            and “the conditioned” only for the sake of instructing beings, for the Buddha explains that
                            this distinction between unconditioned and conditioned is only made on the level of the
                            conditioned, namely, from the perspective of dualistic conventions. Within the realm of
                            these conventional expressions, in the context of the path, it follows that these two
                            domains are apparently mutually exclusive, although the Buddha hints at the fact that, from
                            the perspective of the ultimate, the conditioned is not the conditioned and the
                            unconditioned is not the unconditioned. </p>

                        <p tid="20">Chapter 3 explains how the relation between the ultimate and conditioned phenomena seen from
                            this higher perspective should be communicated on the level of conventions. From this
                            standpoint, one cannot say whether the ultimate is distinct or indistinct from conditioned
                            phenomena. The Buddha shows that positing these two domains as distinct or indistinct is
                            wrong. Since conditioned phenomena are characterized by the fact of being produced by causes
                            and conditions, it is inappropriate to conceive (a) the conditioned and (b) the emptiness of
                            an inherent nature as either identical or different. On the one hand, being conditioned
                            (i.e., dependent on something other) is identical with being empty of an intrinsic nature;
                            on the other hand, the domain of the conditioned is defined as the realm of afflictions,
                            while the domain of the unconditioned is understood as the pure realm. Some might therefore
                            think that phenomena and the nature of phenomena are distinct, but the Buddha teaches in the
                            fourth chapter that the empty nature of conditioned phenomena, the ultimate, cannot be said
                            to be distinct from those phenomena. As such, this subtle and profound ultimate is indeed of
                            a single character within phenomena whose defining characteristic appears to be diverse. To
                            realize this nature of phenomena, which is unconditioned selflessness, one should only rely
                            on nondual gnosis, not mind. </p>

                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">parikalpitalakṣaṇa</foreign>), the
                            other-dependent defining characteristic (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">paratantralakṣaṇa</foreign>), and the actual defining characteristic (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pariniṣpannalakṣaṇa</foreign>): (1) The imaginary defining
                            characteristic is the superimposition onto phenomena of an essence or a defining
                            characteristic existing from its own side, by means of designations or conventional
                            expressions. This imaginary characteristic is utterly false in the way of a visual
                            aberration, since phenomena are ultimately devoid of any defining characteristic that makes
                            them what they are. (2) The other-dependent defining characteristic corresponds to the
                            dependent arising of phenomena. It refers to phenomenal appearances upon which an imaginary
                            defining characteristic is superimposed. This point is grasped once the imaginary defining
                            characteristic of phenomena is understood to be a wrong conception. It is worth noting that
                            the other-dependent defining characteristic delineates the domain of conditioned cognitions,
                            namely, the mind as presented in chapter 5 (this point is made clear in §VII.10 with regard
                            to karma and rebirth), and as such, represents the domain of affliction (see §VI.11).<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                            (3) The actual defining characteristic is the permanent and immutable reality of phenomena.
                            It is the ultimate unerring object that is manifest once the selflessness of phenomena, the
                            nonexistence of any fictive defining characteristic in phenomena arising dependently, has
                            been realized. Only the actual defining characteristic constitutes the domain of
                            purification, since the other-dependent defines the domain of affliction, namely, the realm
                            of the conditioned. In the closing verses of this chapter, the Buddha gives a quintessential
                            presentation of the path: one should first recognize that phenomena are devoid of imaginary
                            defining characteristics by seeing them as mere designations superimposed on conditioned
                            cognitions. At that time, one will abandon phenomena characterized by affliction, namely,
                            conditioned phenomena in the form of conditioned cognitions, and turn toward phenomena
                            characterized by purification that are in harmony with ultimate reality. </p>

                        <p tid="24">Chapter 7 begins with Paramārthasamudgata’s question: why did the Buddha first teach the
                            defining characteristic of phenomena, their arising, their cessation, and so forth through
                            the notions of the five aggregates, the twelve sense domains, and so on, when he later
                            explained that all phenomena are without an essence? The Buddha answers by teaching the
                            three kinds of essencelessness, namely, essencelessness regarding defining characteristics,
                            essencelessness regarding arising, and essencelessness regarding the ultimate: (1)
                            Essencelessness regarding defining characteristics refers to the imaginary defining
                            characteristic of phenomena. It is the essencelessness of what is utterly nonexistent (i.e.,
                            the defining characteristic), which is like a sky flower. (2) Essencelessness regarding
                            arising refers to the other-dependent defining characteristic of phenomena arising from
                            causes other than themselves. It is presented as the magic illusion of dependent arising, in
                            the context of this teaching the magic illusion of mind. (3) Essencelessness regarding the
                            ultimate has two aspects. The first is the essencelessness of all conditioned phenomena with
                            regard to the ultimate. As a corollary of dependent arising, those phenomena are in fact not
                            born as anything, being dependent on causes and conditions for their arising and therefore
                            impermanent. The second aspect of essencelessness with regard to the ultimate refers to the
                            only unconditioned object of purification, the actual defining characteristic of phenomena,
                            the ultimate selflessness of phenomena, which is like space, itself also unconditioned. This
                            permanent and immutable nature of phenomena is the primordial state of peace of that which,
                            being without a defining characteristic, is unborn and unceasing, by nature in the state of
                            nirvāṇa. </p>

                        <p tid="25">In §VII.10, the Buddha describes the entire process leading to confusion: beings reify the
                            other-dependent and the actual defining characteristics in terms of the imaginary defining
                            characteristic. Failing to understand that conventional expressions do not refer to actual
                            things, they superimpose an essence on conditioned cognitions and imagine reality to be just
                            as it is described by their linguistic conventions. Figments of imagination become causes
                            and conditions for their mental activities, which will lead them to the afflictions of
                            action and rebirth. The process described here is akin to a world of virtual reality where
                            even the projector, the conditioned mind, is imaginary. As one takes the projected phenomena
                            as real and reifies them, one acts, suffers, dies, and is endlessly “respawned” within this
                            virtual reality. Although this pseudo-reality projected by mind is nonexistent, it will
                            condition one’s mind and one’s future existence as one will act in accordance with one’s
                            state of mind within this virtual reality. In §VII.10, the other-dependent is therefore
                            equated with the appropriating mind, the basis of the imaginary defining characteristic of
                            phenomena, the object of dreamlike conceptualizations (see also §VII.25). </p>

                        <p tid="26">Next, the Buddha explains how various beings relate to this process and how he has helped
                            them with teachings corresponding to their circumstances and capacities. For example, some
                            can understand on a dualistic level that defining characteristics (i.e., the virtual reality
                            of phenomena) lack an essence, and thus slowly develop repulsion toward conditioned
                            phenomena, even if they are not able to realize the ultimate nature of phenomena, their
                            nondual primordial selflessness which is the domain of gnosis. In accordance with this model
                            of reality, the Buddha declares that there is only the path and journey toward liberation
                            and thus a Single Vehicle for both hearers and bodhisattvas because there is only a single
                            purification. </p>

                        <p tid="27">In §VII.30, Paramārthasamudgata defines the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma. Because
                            this doctrine is included in this specific chapter, it seems logical to interpret the three
                            turnings of the wheel of Dharma in relation to the three kinds of essencelessness: (1) The
                            first turning used the notion that phenomena have a defining characteristic to teach the
                            essencelessness of these defining characteristics in a series of teachings such as the five
                            aggregates, the twelve sense domains, and so on (see also §IV.1–6). In our metaphor on
                            virtual reality, one could see these teachings as being expounded on the basis of the very
                            imaginary phenomena conceptualized as truly existing. When children experience a nightmare,
                            their parents show that the monster does not exist by implicitly, i.e. provisionally,
                            accepting its existence, saying, “Look! It is not there.” (2) The second turning of the
                            wheel teaches the first aspect of essencelessness with regard to the ultimate, stating that
                            phenomena are unborn. From this perspective, the primordial selflessness of phenomena is
                            still taught in relation to dualistic phenomena. As a consequence, Paramārthasamudgata
                            considers this cycle of teachings as provisional. (3) The third turning of the wheel aims at
                            teaching the second aspect of essencelessness with regard to the ultimate in a way that is
                            not limited to the domain of dualistic phenomena. To pursue our metaphor, this third cycle
                            of teachings gives a complete overview of the three defining characteristics of phenomena:
                            the completely imaginary experience of a virtual reality, the magic illusion of the
                            projecting mind, and the primordial domain of gnosis. Paramārthasamudgata declares the third
                            turning to be of definitive meaning. </p>

                            through mereological and relational strategies; (2) the deconstruction of notions of a self
                            regarding conditioned phenomena through the impossibility of their ultimate arising, since
                            these conditioned phenomena merely exist in dependence; and (3) the pointing out of the
                            nondual ultimate nature of phenomena, which altogether bypasses imaginary mental
                            constructions. </p>

                        <p tid="29">In the eighth chapter, the famous Maitreya chapter on meditation, the Buddha first gives a
                            series of definitions followed by the description of a process, a pattern frequently used in
                            this sūtra. First, the objects of the practices of mental stillness (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śamatha</foreign>) and insight (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vipaśyanā</foreign>) are defined as, respectively, an image without and with
                            conceptualization, while their objects, when both practices are combined, are the point
                            where things end (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vastvanta</foreign>) and the
                            accomplishment of the goal (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kṛtyānuṣṭhāna</foreign>,
                            i.e., the attainment of the path). Mental stillness consists in directing one’s attention
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">manasikāra</foreign>) inward toward the mind
                            that is directing attention (see §VIII.3). It follows a state of inner absorption produced
                            by concentrating on a referential object. The practice of insight consists in analyzing,
                            discerning, and differentiating the various cognitive aspects of the image (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratibimba</foreign>) that is the object of concentration.
                            These two practices are neither different nor identical. They are not different in that they
                            take mind as a referential object, but they are not identical because insight takes a
                            conceptual image as its referential object. The Buddha thus explains in an often-cited
                            passage that this image taken as an object of concentration is not different from mind
                            insofar as cognition is constituted by the mere representation (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñaptimātra</foreign>) that is the object of this cognition. The mind and
                            the image, which is its object manifesting as a mental event, appear as different, although
                            they are not. All mental images, whether in the context of practice or not, are mere
                            representations. Once one has realized this, directing one’s attention toward true reality
                            is the one-pointedness of mind in which mental stillness and insight are unified. A superior
                            way to practice this path is therefore to focus on that which is universal in all the
                            various specific teachings imparted by the Buddha. This approach, which is based on a
                            practice devoid of mental engagement (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vitarka</foreign>) and investigation (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vicāra</foreign>), directly focuses on the element that converges toward true reality.
                            The ensuing shift in one’s basis of existence (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">āśrayaparivṛtti</foreign>) mentioned in this sūtra does not here refer to a
                            transformation of the subliminal cognition (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ālayavijñāna</foreign>). According to §X.2, this shift, once all corruption has been
                            eliminated, consists in nothing other than the bodhisattva’s attainment of the truth body
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmakāya</foreign>). </p>
                        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-049-001-25"/>
                        <p tid="30">The Buddha then explains how one attends to phenomenal appearances in an increasingly
                            nonconceptual way. He also gives an elucidation of the analytical knowledge of designations
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmapratisaṃvid</foreign>) and their objects
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">arthapratisaṃvid</foreign>) attained through the
                            practice of mental stillness and insight. In this context, a few key definitions are given;
                            for example, the true reality of representations is that all conditioned phenomena are mere
                            representations (see §VIII.20.2.iii). When presented in four aspects, the analytical
                            knowledge of designations and their objects encapsulate the entire path through the four
                            stages of mental appropriation, experience, affliction, and purification. When asked about
                            the nature of gnosis, the Buddha answers that it “consists in the mental stillness and
                            insight that take a universal teaching as a referential object” while “perception consists
                            in the mental stillness and insight that take a specific teaching as a referential object”
                            (see §VIII.25). Practically, bodhisattvas direct their attention to true reality, discarding
                            the phenomenal appearances of designations and objects of designation. Without taking any
                            essential characteristic as a referential object, they do not pay attention to phenomenal
                            appearances. Their attention is focused on that which is of a single character within all
                            phenomena. The Buddha then gives a list of all the phenomenal appearances eliminated by
                            emptiness, from the emptiness of all phenomena up to the emptiness of emptiness. By letting
                            go of their object of concentration, the phenomenal appearance corresponding to a mental
                            image, bodhisattvas free themselves from the bonds of conditioned phenomenal appearances
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nimitta</foreign>). Connecting these
                            instructions on meditative practice with his teaching on the three defining characteristics,
                            the Buddha explains that he taught the defining characteristic of emptiness in the Great
                            Vehicle as the nonexistence and nonperception of an imaginary defining characteristic with
                            regard to both affliction and purification in the other-dependent and actual defining
                            characteristics of phenomena. </p>
                        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-049-001-26"/>
                        <p tid="31">Practical instructions are also given to overcome obstacles and distractions to the practice
                            of mental stillness and insight. On the ultimate stage of the path, these practices
                            eliminate extremely subtle obstructions resulting in the complete purification of the truth
                            body. The gnosis and vision utterly free from attachment and hindrance are attained.
                            Finally, the Buddha explains how bodhisattvas obtain their great powers by being skillful in
                            the following six points: (1) the arising of the mind, (2) the underlying condition of the
                            mind, (3) the emergence from the mind, (4) the increase of the mind, (5) the decrease of the
                            mind, and (6) skillful means. In this section of the Maitreya chapter, an overview of the
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñaptimātra</foreign> doctrine is given through
                            the notion of cognition, which includes the appropriating cognition as well as the arising
                            cognitions taking various phenomenal appearances as their object. In this context, it is
                            explained that the supramundane mind of the buddhas does not have any phenomenal appearance
                            as its object.</p>

                        <p tid="32">In chapter 9, the Buddha is questioned on the stages (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūmi</foreign>) of a bodhisattva and a buddha, the names of these stages, and their
                            adverse factors and specific arising, as well as on the ten perfections (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pāramitā</foreign>). A final instruction is imparted
                            regarding the Single Vehicle. As mentioned in previous chapters, the Buddha explains that he
                            taught the essence of phenomena in the vehicle of hearers in terms of the aggregates, the
                            sense domains, and so on, and that he presented these phenomena in the light of a single
                            principle in the Great Vehicle, the domain of truth (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmadhātu</foreign>). Those who conceptualize these teachings by taking them
                            literally do not understand his underlying intention, which is that both vehicles are in
                            fact teachings based on a single principle.</p>

                            truth body of the tathāgatas. The Buddha explains the truth body in the sense of a result
                            attained through the practice of the stages and perfections. This attainment consists in a
                            shift in one’s basis of existence. From the perspective of beings belonging to the domain of
                            mental elaborations and conditioned phenomena, the truth body is therefore inconceivable,
                            being utterly beyond mental elaborations,. Here again the Buddha delineates two distinct
                            realms. </p>

                            their skillful means and sovereign power (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">adhiṣṭhāna</foreign>), they liberate beings by imparting three kinds of teaching: the
                            sūtras, the Vinaya, and the mātṛkās (generally taken as more or less equivalent to the
                            Abhidharma and related literature): (1) The sūtras teach what was heard, how to take refuge,
                            the training, and the awakening. (2) The Vinaya teaches the precepts and vows of individual
                            liberation to hearers and bodhisattvas. (3) The mātṛkās are systematic teachings on
                            important doctrinal points, such as the defining characteristic of the conventional and the
                            ultimate, the defining characteristic of referential objects consisting of the awakening
                            factors and their features, and so forth. In the section of the mātṛkā pertaining to the
                            ascertainment of the qualities of cognitive objects, the Buddha goes into a lengthy
                            discussion on logical analysis according to the four principles of reason (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yukti</foreign>): (1) the principle of reason based on
                            dependence (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">apekṣāyukti</foreign>), (2) the principle
                            of reason based on cause and effect (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāryakāraṇayukti</foreign>), (3) the principle of reason based on logical proof
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">upapattisādhanayukti</foreign>), and (4) the
                            principle of reason based on the nature of phenomena itself (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmatāyukti</foreign>). The explanation given by the Buddha on the third
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yukti</foreign> of this list (cf. §X.7.4.vii.c)
                            is very extensive and resembles a short treatise on epistemology in which the notion of
                            means of knowledge or valid cognition (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pramāṇa</foreign>) is meticulously investigated. In this section, the Buddha explains
                            the characteristics of valid and invalid reasonings. He concludes by stating that three
                            types of valid cognition should be accepted: direct cognition (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratyakṣa</foreign>), inference (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anumāna</foreign>), and authoritative scriptures (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">āptāgama</foreign>). </p>

                            unconditioned (i.e., the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmakāya</foreign>). In
                            this context, the Buddha concludes by explaining that the tathāgatas are not characterized
                            by mind, thought, and cognition. Their mind arises without effort in the way of an emanation
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nirmāṇa</foreign>). In their case, one cannot
                            say whether their mind exists or not, their domain consisting of pure realms. It follows
                            that the tathāgatas are characterized by nonduality: “They are neither completely and
                            perfectly awakened nor not completely and perfectly awakened; they neither turn the wheel of
                            Dharma nor do not turn the wheel of Dharma; they neither attain the great parinirvāṇa nor do
                            not attain the great parinirvāṇa. This is because the truth body is utterly pure and the
                            emanation body constantly manifests.” Once the truth body has been purified through the
                            practice focusing on the domain of truth (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmadhātu</foreign>), “the great light of gnosis manifests in beings, and innumerable
                            emanated reflections arise.” One should keep in mind, though, the teachings imparted in
                            Chapter 3 on the conventional and ultimate truths. From the perspective of the ultimate,
                            nothing has ever been purified by anybody, as the concluding verses of the formula in

                            invaluable to confirming the findings of my own work on the introduction. The editions
                            belonging to the Thempangma differ significantly from those included in the Tshalpa line of
                            transmission. As an independent Kangyur close to the Thempangma line, the Phukdrak (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phug brag</foreign>) edition offers very interesting
                            readings on the level of syntax and lexicography compared to the editions of the Tshalpa
                            group. It also diverges from the Thempangma witnesses in many locations. In the absence of
                            colophons mentioning the translators’ and editors’ names across the available editions, it
                            remains difficult to understand the history of these witnesses from the perspective of the
                            underlying translation and editing process. As a consequence of its palatable variant
                            readings compared to the Tshalpa and Thempangma editions, I used the Phukdrak witness quite
                            extensively while translating the Degé edition, as well as the Stok edition and the Degé
                            version of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Viniścayasaṃgrahaṇī</title>&lt;Reference Toh
                            4038&gt;, to examine more thoroughly difficult passages. The available Sanskrit fragments
                            were on occasion also useful to determine the Sanskrit equivalent of a Tibetan technical
                            term. They, however, did not reveal major variations from the Tibetan texts. I referred to
                            the Dunhuang recension sporadically, as Schmithausen warned us not to follow it blindly.<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                            to the one (or those) used for the translation upon which the Tibetan Tshalpa editions are

                            that has early on attracted the attention of Buddhist Studies scholars. It has been
                            translated into French, English, and German (partially). Lamotte (1935) provided a critical
                            edition of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> and a translation from Tibetan
                            (N) and Chinese (Taishō 676) into French. He also attempted to reconstruct or identify
                            technical terms in Sanskrit, which have for the most part been confirmed by subsequent finds

                            major resource for the study of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title>. It has
                            been until now the standard edition and translation of this text on account of its accuracy
                            and methodological academic approach. As a side note, I followed Lamotte’s segmentation of
                            the text into paragraphs. His French translation is generally reliable, although some
                            technical passages can be significantly improved, particularly in the case of chapter 8 on
                            meditation and chapter 10 on the result of the path. Frauwallner (1969) gives a partial
                            translation of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> (i.e., chapters 6 and 7)
                            from Tibetan into German. As one would expect, Frauwallner’s academic translation of these
                            two chapters aims at accuracy over readability. Kawasaki 1976 is also a partial translation
                            of chapter 8 into English (§6.1–9). This translation does not improve Lamotte’s. Powers’
                            (1995) translation from Tibetan (D) into English, in spite of its merit, could be widely
                            improved upon in terms of methodology, accuracy, and readability.<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                            English. I used Keenan’s work to get a sense of the Chinese text while translating the Degé
                            edition but only referred to Cleary occasionally. Keenan’s work seems to me more accurate
                            than Cleary’s, although the latter was useful for unraveling difficult passages, since his
                            style is more free and primarily intends to communicate the meaning of the text. Cornu
                            (2005) has provided a translation of the text from Tibetan (D) into French that mainly
                            follows Powers 1995, a somewhat regrettable fact since Lamotte’s (1935) is more accurate.
                            Schmithausen’s (2014) work contains numerous difficult passages of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> translated from various Tibetan and Chinese editions into

                            important technical terms. Together with Lamotte’s translation, it has been a constant

                            example, one should pay attention to the fact that interpreting “representation-only”

                            idealism essentializing mind could be misleading from the perspective of a cultural
                            translation of the worldview propounded in <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title>
                            since mind, just as much as the external object, is explicitly declared to be empty of any
                            own-being, essence, or intrinsic nature (see chapter 8 on the three kinds of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niḥsvabhāvatā</foreign>) in this text.<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                            on the basis of lexicographical resources (e.g., dictionaries) and syntactic rules (e.g.,
                            grammars). During this operation, it is important to distinguish what is understood and what
                            still remains problematic. All options should be kept open. Interpretations or eisegetical
                            readings should be rejected. From a practical perspective, I systematically used the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title> to find the Sanskrit terms behind general
                            Tibetan expressions. For technical terms, I relied on Schmithausen (2014) and the academic

                            can be seen in the following examples: One should read the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">brtsams pa</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ārabhya</foreign>, a Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit expression that has the

                            advises us to bring together the various elements of a sentence or a passage until we obtain
                            a clear picture of what is said in the source text. This step therefore consists in
                            understanding the meaning of the translated passage by literally <emph>seeing</emph> (or
                            visualizing) its meaning. In a way, the first operation is about <foreign xml:lang="Input Language" type="term">das Erklären</foreign> (“explanation”), while the
                            second concerns <foreign xml:lang="Input Language" type="term">das Verstehen</foreign>
                            (“understanding”). In this sense, the latter uses the resources of one’s imagination and
                            metalinguistic knowledge to establish connections with a web of meaning that is not
                            restricted to the translated sentence or passage alone. </p>
                        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-049-001-131"/>
                        <p tid="125">The second operation is therefore a synthesis, a recognition of relations between meaning
                            units of various orders (one would think here of the idea conveyed by <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saṃjñā</foreign> and similar terms in which the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">upasarga</foreign>
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sam</foreign>- plays a central role), whereas the first phase is
                            analytical (in the sense of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vicāra</foreign>,
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vicāraṇa</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñāna,</foreign> in which the upasarga <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vi</foreign>- expresses the notion of taking apart). In fact,
                            translators translate into the target language their comprehension of the source text. They
                            actually never translate the text itself but their understanding or representation of ideas,
                            situations, and emotions conveyed by a text. To illustrate this point, one could mention the
                            problem, encountered by scholars, of translating terms related to meditative practice. The
                            Maitreya chapter of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> is probably the most
                            difficult to understand if one is not familiar with Buddhist practice. Lamotte translates
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">manasikāra</foreign> with “réflection,” while
                            Frauwallner uses “Beobachtung” (lit. “observation”). Both these translation choices
                            obfuscate the meaning of what the term “directing one’s attention” actually denotes. This is
                            not in itself a major issue, but if such inaccuracies proliferate in the same passage or
                            chapter, the meaning of the translation becomes unclear, although it may well be technically
                            correct on a syntactic level and lexicographical perspective (at least when it comes to
                            correctly identifying Tibetan technical terms on the basis of the Sanskrit). </p>

                        <p tid="126">In the context of pre-Dignāgean Buddhist logic, chapter 10 represents another case in point.
                            This chapter is indeed replete with abstruse concepts not belonging to the well-researched
                            and documented later systems of Buddhist logic. In this case, translating the many
                            occurrences of the connective particle <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">kyi</foreign>
                            in long compounds with the English preposition “of” will not help the reader much, though it
                            will certainly give the translators the peace of mind of having produced a “technically
                            correct” translation. However, I believe that translators have only two options here: (a)
                            take a risk and, for example, tell us if they actually understand the connective <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">kyi</foreign> in the sense of “belonging to,” “resulting
                            from,” “consisting of,” and so on; or (b) admit that they do not understand the source text.
                            In the case of the technical compounds found in chapter 10, I therefore tried to ask myself
                            what these terms actually referred to, what could have been the system of logic presented in
                            these pages. For example, I read <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">gzhan gyi rigs kyi

                            Tibetan a Sanskrit bahuvrīhi. As a consequence, I translated this long compound with “[The

                            class [of phenomena]” </p>

                            research on the subject matter is necessary. But in order to translate these technical
                            terms, we cannot just give a technically correct translation of a succession of words.
                            Beyond the first phase of the work, which is purely analytical, we still need to develop a
                            mental representation of the situation presented in the text by establishing relations with
                            a context that might go beyond the text. </p>

                            writers. They should formulate in the target language their understanding of the source text
                            as accurately and naturally as possible. At this stage, translators should focus on literary
                            elements of the translation, such as idioms, voice, and figures of speech. According to
                            Billeter, difficulties in writing accurately and naturally in the target language are often
                            the direct consequence of not having performed the second operation. The translation might
                            well be technically correct, but it still does not make sense, an experience all translators
                            go through when they fail to understand the meaning (or visualize the situation) referred to
                            by the source text. </p>

                            constraints and conventions in the formulation of the source text as well as those imposed

                            How would someone express the same ideas in the target language? As a consequence, the
                            notion of form and pragmatics in the target language becomes central. To detail the various
                            operations leading to an actual translation, Vinay and Darbelnet’s model is useful.<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                            translation in relation to the translation process: the lexicon (e.g., semantic values,
                            objective and affective aspects, lexical associations and modulations), the syntactic
                            structure (e.g., transpositions between word classes, supplementation of pronouns or
                            conjunctions, modifications in terms of gender, number, characterization, tenses, voice,
                            modality, and verbal aspects), and the message (e.g., meaning, stylistics, pragmatics,
                            topicalization, figures of speech, metalinguistic aspects, specific segmentation of
                            reality). Then, they should examine the descriptive, affective, and intellectual content of
                            the units of translation in the source text to reconstitute the situation at the origin of
                            the message. These two first steps correspond to Billeter’s two first operations. Finally,
                            translators still have to formulate the message in the target language without omitting any

                            Sanskrit, or scholastic Sanskrit, in which the nominalization of verbal clauses by means of
                            compounds or suffixes is common. As is often the case in technical or hyperspecialized
                            environments, processes or conceptual frameworks are encapsulated as technical terms (often
                            nouns) implying a complex or recurring pattern. As an analogy, think of a medical term such
                            as hemiglossectomy standing for a removal of a part of the tongue. The passive impersonal
                            phrase “a hemiglossectomy was performed on the patient at 11 pm” includes the nominalization
                            of an action through a compound (hemiglossectomy). It could be rewritten as “[the surgeon]
                            removed a portion of the patient’s tongue at 11 pm.” As can be seen from the translations of
                            Lamotte and Frauwallner, nominalization seems to be less of a problem in French and German
                            than it is in modern (American) English in which readability is more of a concern. When
                            translating the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title>, I therefore tried to turn
                            nominal compounds common in scholastic Sanskrit into English verbal sentences by transposing
                            these compounds into verbal sentences. However, since the text is very technical
                            (particularly from Chapter 7 onward), I decided in some cases to keep nominal compounds that
                            were indicative of a technical term and not just a nontechnical action or state of affairs.
                            For example, the text mentions throughout a “concept” being referred to a “X” (see for
                            instance §VII.3–6). Just like the surgical term above, such complex nominal compounds stand
                            for a specific action or concept and are part of a “specialist’s jargon.” Turning these
                            compounds into verbal sentences might have the counterproductive effect of erasing an
                            essential feature of this kind of literature consisting in endless lists of often technical
                            terms. Therefore, in this particular case, it would probably be best to avoid

                            modulation. Any change of syntactic subject for the sake of clarifying a sentence would be a
                            modulation. Whether this decision is appropriate or not on the part of the translator is

                        <p tid="138">I would like to illustrate this point with issues related to the nidāna of the sūtra, in
                            which topicalization plays an important role. The first paragraph of the introduction is a
                            presentation of the place where the Buddha is dwelling. The topicalization of the temple
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khang</foreign>) is achieved through a
                            succession of compounds, mainly bahuvrīhis. Lamotte’s translation reflects this
                            thematization to perfection. In contrast, Powers fails to topicalize the palace to the same
                            degree. In his translation, the logical subject of the several clauses describing this
                            palace is sometimes ambiguous. In this case, one should consider the fact that the Sanskrit
                            structure of this paragraph is built on a process of topicalization that we can easily
                            render in English. In a word, we have no reason to alter this literary device by inducing a
                            modulation of the translation through a change of perspective induced, for example, by a
                            modification of the grammatical or logical subject in the target language. </p>

                        <p tid="142">Returning to Billeter’s schema, in his fourth operation the translator should verify that
                            what has been translated into the target language corresponds to the meaning of the source
                            text. Do the two texts express the same idea? Do they produce the same effect on the reader?
                            To answer these questions, Billeter recommends reading one’s text aloud. During this
                            operation, translators should also check whether the translation fits within a specific
                            cultural register in the target language. Discourses take place within a corpus of existing
                            literature that is culturally determined by centuries of textual production. Some statements
                            from a different cultural background resonate through a web of meaning, discursive
                            practices, or literary figures of speech once expressed in the target language. In fact, the
                            web of meaning of the target language within which the translation is received finds its
                            parallel in the web of meaning within which the source text was produced. Within the source
                            text and culture, concepts, ideas, and references resonate throughout sentences, paragraphs,
                            chapters, works, and genres. For example, some philosophical definitions can represent
                            intratextual and extratextual variations on a theme for which there is no metalinguistic
                            context in the target language. Translators therefore need to understand the text not only
                            as a whole and in relation to its various components, but also in connection with both the
                            source and the target cultures. This is of course particularly true of more “philosophical”
                            texts for which it is essential to evaluate how the translation interacts with the webs of
                            meaning of the source and target cultures. Practically, it is important to cross check the
                            consistency (or lack thereof) of meaning units across the text while keeping in mind that
                            the translation is also obviously culturally situated. This process is fundamental because
                            it facilitates the validation (or invalidation) of translation hypotheses resulting from the
                            two first steps of the translation process. </p>

                            quite different in structure. For instance, Paramārtha’s translation includes only the first
                            four chapters, which, according to Lamotte, might have originally formed an independent
                            sūtra. In addition, it is obvious that the ten chapters of <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> do not follow a consistent textual pattern. The first six have
                            no title. They are concluded by a few summarizing <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gāthā</foreign>s and a standard formula indicating the name of the person who
                            questioned the Buddha and the number of the chapter (e.g., “This was the chapter of
                            Guṇākara—the sixth chapter”). Chapter 7 has a whole summary of the chapter in the form of a
                            supplement right after the concluding gāthās, while in chapter 10 the Buddha is questioned
                            on complementary topics once the concluded gāthās have been proclaimed. Chapters 7, 8, 9,
                            and 10 each come to an end with a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nītārthanirdeśa</foreign> (instruction of definitive meaning) on the chapter topic.

                            title. On account of this, Lamotte surmises that there might have originally been several
                            independent <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">saṃdhinirmocanasūtra</title>s that came to be grouped
                            together as the text we know today. </p>

                        <p tid="145">One should also note that the dialogue structure of chapters 1 through 7 differs from that of
                            chapters 8 through 10. In the first group, the Buddha elaborates on a topic in the form of a
                            monologue once his interlocutor has questioned him on a specific topic, whereas in the
                            second group a dialogue takes place through short questions and answers. As a consequence of
                            all these philological divergences, one has to conclude that the text is rather composite in
                            nature and probably the result of a succession of additions and adjustments. In a word, I

                            However, this hypothesis should ideally be the object of further research by a team
                            following an approach similar to that of Professor Jonathan Silk’s European Research Council
                            project “Open Philology — The Composition of Buddhist Scriptures” at the University of

                        <p tid="146">From the perspective of the narrative and doctrinal content of the Tibetan translation, a
                            somewhat different picture emerges. Even if each chapter does not depend on all others in
                            terms of meaning, there is definitely a progression with regard to the flow of thought in
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> insofar as later chapters do depend on
                            the definitions and lines of thinking posited in the former chapters, a central fact for
                            translators of this complex text. We can perceive this continuity in the intratextual
                            cross-references that create a terminological resonance echoing throughout the text.
                            Unraveling these cross-references is as important during the translation process as noting
                            the textual variations indicating a deviation from a specific literary pattern. While
                            translating I thus tried to evaluate the text in terms of regularities and discontinuities
                            in the use of definitions and the flow of meaning unfolding throughout the text. One should
                            therefore temper the impression that the text has been “patched” together on the basis of
                            loosely related texts on the basis of philological arguments whose significance is difficult
                            to assess. For example, the fact that chapter 1 is the only chapter in which a dialogue
                            occurs between two bodhisattvas has never been mentioned by any researcher as a textual
                            inconsistency preventing them from considering the first four chapters as a coherent whole.
                            Minor divergences should therefore not deter us from asking ourselves why these chapters
                            were taught or put together in the first place. I would like to illustrate with a few
                            concrete examples the doctrinal coherence of the text. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ādānavijñāna</foreign> in §V.3 is also found in §VIII.37.1.i; the model of

                            found in this order: the structure of the text as we know it today is necessary to provide
                            Mahāyāna practitioners with a systematic teaching on (1) ultimate reality qua <hi type="wordfile-remnant">basis</hi>, which is the nondual inexpressible domain of gnosis
                            (chapters 1 through 4), (2) the <hi type="wordfile-remnant">path</hi> to awakening from the
                            domain of mind to the domain of gnosis (chapters 5 through 9), and (3) ultimate reality qua

                            succession of independent texts), the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana</title> aims
                            at providing a systematic teaching on the Single Vehicle through the three aspects of basis,

                            were of primary importance for followers of the Great Vehicle (e.g., the two truths in
                            chapter 3 and meditative practice in chapter 8). Now, if we read the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṃdhinirmocana </title>as a single text, we have to confront the web
                            of meaning found in this text in its entirety with the web of meaning of the target culture

                        <p tid="149">This operation has a major impact on the translation of some key terms, such as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñaptimātra</foreign>. Since idealism (in the sense that
                            mind is an unchanging essence) is not an option given the teaching imparted in this sūtra, I
                            tried to avoid any potential confusion resulting from an unfortunate choice of terminology.
                            In a word, I would rather stay on the safe side than insert in my translation a potentially
                            misleading term. As a consequence, I decided to translate <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñaptimātra</foreign> as “a mere representation” instead of using
                            nominalizations such as “cognition-only.” The first expression is relatively unambiguous in
                            the target culture as it minimizes the risk of misunderstanding the message of the text.
                            Another option would be “just a representation.” These formulations mitigate the risk of
                            superimposing an essence on what is meant by <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vijñapti</foreign>.<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                        <p tid="150">In the last step of the translation process, Billeter recommends that translators perform
                            various operations aiming at polishing the translation, such as replicating the possible
                            effects of semantic resonance throughout the text, improving the connection between
                            sentences and paragraphs, modifying the order of clauses, solving problems of euphony, or
                            editing the translation to make it clearer and simpler by chunking long sentences or
                            eliminating repetitions. To illustrate one of these various tasks in the context of the
                            present project, I decided to review all the terminology pertaining to the semantic field of
                            insight (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vipaśyanā</foreign>) after I had finished
                            translating the entire text. I took as a starting point §VIII.4, in which <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vipaśyanā</foreign> is defined by means of a series of
                            technical terms, such as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratyavekṣaṇa</foreign>,
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vibhājanā</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pravicaya</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">paritarka</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">parimīmāṃsā</foreign>,

                            translation for each term in the context of this chapter. Next, I checked the usage of all
                            these terms and other related concepts (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratisaṃkhyā</foreign>) throughout the text to standardize the corresponding English
                            terminology. I also tried to minimize the use of square brackets indicating additions to the
                            text when these additions were logically implied by the source text. A typology of such
                            situations would include various operations, such as breaking down a compound, clarifying an
                            abbreviated form corresponding to a well-attested collocation, stating a logical subject,
                            object, or verb that is elided in the source text, mentioning the number of a technical term
                            that usually comes as a list of individual items.</p>

                                    Lamotte’s translation reflects this literary device, contrary to Powers who does not
                                    topicalize the palace to the same degree on account of some ambiguities regarding
                                    the logical subject of a few clauses describing this palace. To illustrate this
                                    point, it seems unclear whether the adjectives “steadfast,” “enduring,” or “free” in
                                    Powers’ translation qualify the temple or the beings attending it. Cornu mainly
                                    follows Powers here but the grammatical necessity to indicate the gender and number
                                    of qualifiers in French limits the risk of confusion, which is obviously not the
                                    case in English. Regarding the usage of tenses, Lamotte is the only translator who
                                    uses both narrative past and present in this first paragraph. He thus switches from
                                    the past tense to the present tense in order to describe the characteristics of the

                        that is, visual, auditive, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental cognitions, arise. Among
                        these, a visual cognition arises on the basis of the eye, which is connected with a visual
                        cognition and a visual form. Simultaneously and in conformity with this visual cognition, a
                        mental cognition that conceptualizes the object arises at the same time, having the same object.
                        [Likewise,] Viśālamati, an auditive, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile cognition arises on the
                        basis of a sense faculty connected to a cognition, such as the ear, nose, tongue, or body, and a
                        sound, smell, flavor, or tangible object. Simultaneously and in conformity with this[auditive,
                        olfactory, gustatory, or tactile cognition, a mental cognition that conceptualizes the object
                        arises at the same time, having the same object. If only one visual cognition arises at one
                        time, [F.13.a] then only one mental cognition that conceptualizes the object arises
                        simultaneously, having the same object. If two, three, four, or five cognitions arise
                        simultaneously, then also in that case, having the same object as the group of five cognitions,
                        only one mental cognition that conceptualizes this object arises simultaneously.<hi type="wordfile-remnant">

                        themselves and in their own experience, neither perceive thought, nor phenomena, nor mental
                        cognition but instead perceive in accordance with the truth. Viśālamati, the Tathāgata
                        designates as skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and cognition the bodhisattvas who are
                        skilled in the ultimate. Viśālamati, for this reason, bodhisattvas are skilled in the secrets of
                        mind, thought, and cognition. Also, when the Tathāgata designates them as such, it is for this
                        reason.”</p>

                                    ambiguous and could be potentially misleading on account of the German preposition
                                    “nach”: “Es ist jede Festsetzung eines Namens und einer Vereinbarung für die
                                    Gegebenheiten </hi>
                                <hi type="wordfile-remnant">nach</hi>

                                    Wesen oder Besonderheit, um sie im täglichen Sprachgebrauch zu bezeichnen.”
                                    (Frauwallner 1969, p. 286). If one reads this sentence as “a determination†</hi>
                                <hi type="wordfile-remnant">in terms of</hi>
                                <hi type="wordfile-remnant"> being and
                                    specific defining characteristic,” then the translation is correct. However, if one
                                    reads it as meaning “the determination† of . . . </hi>
                                <hi type="wordfile-remnant">in
                                    accordance with/corresponding to</hi>
                                <hi type="wordfile-remnant"> [their] being or
                                    specific defining characteristic,” then the translation becomes problematic since
                                    the point made in the text is precisely that there is no such thing. The
                                    determination† (Festsetzung) of a name and convention for phenomena (für die
                                    Gegebenheiten) is not made according to the essence or defining characteristic of
                                    phenomena (nach Wesen oder Besonderheit). Hence the term “imaginary defining
                                    characteristic.” If this determination† occurred according to the essence of
                                    phenomena, it would be illogical to call this defining characteristic “imaginary.”
                                    Lamotte’s translation is therefore more accurate in the present case, although his

                                    in the following way: “Es ist die Soheit der Gegebenheiten, ihr Erschauen durch die

                                    Zustandekommen der hochsten vollkommenen Erleuchtung.” (Frauwallner 1969, p. 286).
                                    Lamotte 1935, p. 189 is similar to Frauwallner’s reading. It is plausible that

                        taste,’ ‘I touch,’ ‘I am conscious,’ ‘I eat,’ ‘I do,’ ‘I am afflicted,’ and ‘I am purified.’
