                    principles related to bodhisattva practice, each item of which is subsequently defined. These come
                    together to teach Mañjuśrī how bodhisattvas can be “inspired” and thereby prepare themselves for the
                    first bodhisattva level. In the latter part of the sūtra Samantabhadra teaches on the topic of
                    buddha activity with a rich account of the expansive way in which buddhas act to benefit beings.

                    <title xml:lang="en">The Seal of Engagement in Awakening the Power of Faith</title> consists of two
                    lengthy discourses that address two separate inquiries voiced by the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. At the
                    beginning of the sūtra, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī requests the Buddha to show how his followers
                    should practice in order to attain the first bodhisattva level. This inspires the Buddha to embark
                    on an extensive discourse that centers on the topic of how bodhisattvas can be “inspired” (Tib.
                        <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dbugs ’byin pa</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">āśvasta</foreign>) in their spiritual practice. “Inspiration” also has a connotation
                    of “encouragement” or “relief,” and, specifically in the context of the Great Vehicle, the term
                    carries a meaning of being revived from the complacent individual quiescence of the Lesser Vehicle.
                    Here, however, it evidently refers to anything and everything that makes up bodhisattva practice.
                    Still, the one thing shared by all the ways of finding inspiration mentioned by the Buddha is the
                    necessity of first committing oneself to the practice in order to inspire others to pursue these
                    trainings. The explanations given by the Buddha in this part of the sūtra all take the form of
                    instructions presented in sets of five. </p>

                <p tid="7">In the second part of the sūtra, Mañjuśrī reappears as the interlocutor, this time to ask the
                    bodhisattva Samantabhadra a series of questions regarding the activity of buddhas. This shifts the
                    topic of discussion from the realm of bodhisattvas to that of buddhas, and with this topical change
                    the form of the discourse alters as well. Here Samantabhadra’s reply breaks with the orderly
                    structure of the recurring quintuples into an inspired portrait of how awakened beings manifest
                    throughout the universe. This description of how buddhas enact their activity in manifold ways for
                    manifold beings takes on the language of poetry and metaphor, and is clearly intended to astound,
                    and to cast the buddhas as supernatural, cosmic beings. </p>

                <p tid="8">No complete Sanskrit manuscript of the sūtra remains, but the text is cited several times in Indian

                        305) is likewise grouped together with the Buddhāvataṃsaka collection of scriptures.</note> In
                    the Degé Kangyur, however, the sūtra is not included in the Buddhāvataṃsaka section, but instead is
                    found in the general sūtra section (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mdo sde</foreign>). Due to the inclusion of the sūtra in the
                    <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sūtrasamuccaya</title>, Skilling and Saerji have dated the text to circa 150-250 <hi rend="small-caps">CE</hi>, but this
                    dating is tentative and not conclusive.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-001-8"> Skilling 2013, p. 216. Skilling and Saerji
                        also mention that this dating is uncertain (p. 203, no. 51).</note> The sūtra is also briefly
                    quoted four times by Śāntideva (seventh century) in his <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śikṣāsamuccaya</title> and two times in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhāvanākrama</title> by Kamalaśīla (eigth

                        identified these passages in notes to the translation. The edited Sanskrit of these four
                        passages are found in Bendall 1971. See also Mahoney (et al.) 2003.</note> In Chinese, we find a

                    the Kashmiri translator Dharmaruci. The Tibetan translation is attributed to the Indian preceptor
                    Surendrabodhi and the prolific translator Yeshé Dé, who both were active in Tibet in the late eighth
                    and early ninth centuries. As such, we can date the Tibetan translation to the late eighth to early
                    ninth centuries, a dating that is also attested by the text’s inclusion in the early ninth century

                    secluded Dharma hermitage, a luminous mansion. This mansion had amassed gatherings of ornaments of
                    great merit. It was beyond reproach, possessed boundless qualities, and was built as solid as vajra.
                    The indestructible ground was ornamented with flowers studded with every type of precious gem and
                    decorated with a lattice of jewels that shone immaculately. A vast ocean of precious gems of myriad
                    colors glimmered brilliantly; it was formed out of the kings of precious gems that rained down in an
                    unceasing shower. <ref cRef="F.2.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-062-001-712"/> There were rivers swirling with a variety of flowers with jeweled stems

                    in that city there were a bodhisattva who was devoted to this Dharma discourse, the associated karma
                    would lead him or her not to be reborn in the abodes of immediate retribution for innumerable eons.
                    The city, moreover, would be free of disturbance. However, it could happen that the karma of those
                    bodhisattvas did not cause conflicts with the king, disturbances related to water, disturbances
                    related to thieves and bandits, disturbances related to famine, disturbances related to fire, or
                    disturbances related to barbarians. Still, if the bodhisattva devoted to this Dharma discourse had
                    the karma to be reborn for countless eons in the hells, or as an animal, or a hungry spirit, such
                    disturbances would in fact occur in that city. Why is that? It is because any karma that he or she
                    might have to be reborn into immediate retribution for an inexpressible, incalculable number of
                    eons, as well as the karma he or she might have to suffer through the lower realms for ten, twenty,
                    or thirty eons, would be experienced already in this life. <ref cRef="F.63.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-062-001-832"/> Through such disturbances, that
                    karma would be purified. How so? It would be due to the great amount of merit that he or she had
                    accumulated.</p>

                    body of water. Similarly, although the karma of having to dwell among hell beings, animals, and
                    hungry spirits for countless eons is immense, it would not ripen. And why not? Due to the great

                                literally meaning “one who has thus gone,” or as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathā-agata</foreign>, “one who has thus come.” <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Gata</foreign>, though literally meaning “gone,” is a past passive participle used
                                to describe a state or condition of existence. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tatha­(tā)</foreign>, often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness,” is the quality or

                                general it implies one who has departed in the wake of the buddhas of the past, or one

From there they progress through the remaining stages of the hearer's path, becoming in turn a once-returner (stages six and five), a non-returner (stages four and three), and an worthy one (stages two and one). This same “eighth stage” also appears in set of ten stages (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">daśabhūmi</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sa bcu</foreign>) found in Great Vehicle sources, where it is the third step out of the ten. Not to be confused with the ten stages of the bodhisattva’s path, these ten stages <term type="ignore">mark</term> the progress of one who sequentially follows the paths of a hearer, solitary buddha, and then bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. In this set of ten stages a person “on the eighth stage” is similarly one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer.</term>
