                    circumstance. They make a commitment to change their ways, which pleases the Buddha, and this leads him to engage in a dialog with
                    the bodhisattva Maitreya on how bodhisattvas, including those in the future age of final degeneration, the final half-millennium,
                    should avoid faults and uphold conduct that accords with the Dharma.</p>

                    <title xml:lang="en">Inspiring Determination</title> appears in the Heap of Jewels (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Ratnakūṭa</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dkon brtsegs</foreign>) section of the
                        Kangyur. The sūtra opens with the bodhisattva Maitreya observing a group of sixty bodhisattvas among the five hundred who have
                        gathered around the Buddha in the Deer Park on the outskirts of Vārāṇasī. These sixty bodhisattvas have strayed from the
                        bodhisattva path. Rather than studying and practicing in solitude, they have become distracted by worldly concerns and have
                        stopped applying themselves to the Dharma. Seeking to help them restore their commitments, Maitreya invites them to approach
                        the Buddha, confess their faults, and request his guidance. The bodhisattvas then reveal and confess to the Buddha their
                        failings and doubts about their capacity to meet the bodhisattva ideal.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-7"/>
                    <p tid="11">The Buddha explains the causes and conditions they created in a former lifetime that have led to their current
                        predicament. Specifically, during the previous period of the Buddha Krakucchanda, these bodhisattvas denigrated and slandered
                        two monks, creating schisms and doubts in the Saṅgha and the wider community. Many lifetimes of painful ripening of this
                        negative karma ensued. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-8"/>
                    <p tid="12">The Buddha further prophesies, however, that although the bodhisattvas’ negative karma will continue to ripen in
                        subsequent lives, once it is finally exhausted, during a period in which the Dharma is declining, they will attain rebirth in
                        the realm of the Buddha Amitābha. Hearing this, the bodhisattvas are newly inspired and resolve not to repeat their mistakes.
                        Maitreya asks the Buddha whether they will abide by their renewed commitment, and he confirms that they will. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-9"/>
                    <p tid="13">This is followed by a lengthy series of enumerations by the Buddha, in response to inquiries by Maitreya, concerning
                        the negative consequences of each fault of conduct in which the sixty bodhisattvas had engaged, as well as the advantages of
                        refraining from each one. In several instances, these lists are presented first in prose form and then repeated in verse as an
                            <foreign xml:lang="fr" type="term">aide-memoire</foreign>. Maitreya’s questions also prompt the Buddha to caution about
                        the future degeneration of the Dharma, when it will be corrupted by the materialistic interests of teachers. He describes the
                        pitfalls of teaching the Dharma without ridding oneself of attachment to personal gain and respect. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-10"/>
                    <p tid="14">The Buddha’s countervailing instruction is to beware of judging the veracity or quality of the Dharma by referencing
                        the perceived motivation or character of the one teaching it. Śāntideva (late seventh to mid-eighth century) emphasizes this
                        point in his <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign>

                        that to be a genuine follower of the Buddha, one must refrain from judging the conduct of fellow practitioners of the
                        Bodhisattva Vehicle; instead, one must focus on detecting and correcting one’s own faults. The Buddha later advises Maitreya
                        that what marks someone as a follower of his teachings, and as an ordained member of his community, is not the formality of
                        vows or the semblance of piety, but rather the cultivation of the qualities of the path, including renunciation,
                        concentration, restrained speech, and the pursuit of wisdom.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-12"> This section of the

                        qualifies as authentic Dharma. His rule, also quoted and discussed by Śāntideva, is that everything that is well-spoken, no
                        matter what it is, or by whom it is offered, is what the Buddha has spoken.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-14"> See

                        in the realm of the Buddha Amitāyus, which is another name for the Buddha Amitābha. This serves as a valediction to his
                        earlier prophecy about the future awakening in Amitāyus’s realm of the group of bodhisattvas who had approached him to confess
                        their wayward conduct and vowed not to repeat their mistakes of attitude and conduct. In this way, <title xml:lang="en">Inspiring Determination</title> fulfills its intention and serves as a set of guidelines and an exhortation for aspiring

                        beings. (2) One must rid oneself of all enmity and generate the positive attitude of compassion for all beings. (3) Without
                        concern for life and limb, one must generate the determination to preserve the sacred Dharma. (4) Through certainty in
                        profound patience, one must develop the attitude of strong dedication to the sacred Dharma. (5) Through not being stained by
                        gain and respect, one must generate the attitude of pure intention. (6) Through perfect recall, one generates the attitude of
                        regarding omniscience as extremely precious. (7) By being dauntless, one generates the attitude of respecting all beings just
                        like gurus. <ref cRef="F.153.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-456"/> (8) Through confidence in the branches of
                        awakening, one develops the attitude of not being satisfied with the taste of mere short-lived meditative concentration. (9)
                        Through non-adulteration, one generates the attitude of a great assortment of virtuous roots. (10) Abandoning
                        characterizations, one develops the attitude of meditating upon recollection of the Buddha.</p>

                            <term type="definition">The bodhisattva who became Śākyamuni’s regent and is prophesied to be the next buddha, the fifth
                                buddha in the fortunate eon. In early Buddhism he appears as the human disciple Maitreya Tiṣya, sent to pay his
                                respects by his teacher. The Buddha gives him the gift of a robe and prophesies he will be the next Buddha, while his
                                companion Ajita will be the next cakravartin. As a bodhisattva in the Mahāyāna, he has both these names.</term>
