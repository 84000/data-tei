                    leads them to seek counsel from the Buddha, who explains the causes these

                    circumstance. They make a commitment to change their ways, which pleases the
                    Buddha, and this leads him to engage in a dialog with the bodhisattva Maitreya
                    on how bodhisattvas, including those in the future age of final degeneration,
                    the final half-millennium, should avoid faults and uphold conduct that accords

                            brtsegs</foreign>) section of the Kangyur. The sūtra opens with the
                        bodhisattva Maitreya observing a group of sixty among the five hundred
                        bodhisattvas who have gathered around the Buddha in the Deer Park on the
                        outskirts of Vārāṇasī. These sixty bodhisattvas have strayed from the
                        bodhisattva path. Rather than studying and practicing in solitude, they have
                        become distracted by worldly concerns and have stopped applying themselves
                        to the Dharma. Seeking to help them restore their commitments, Maitreya
                        invites them to approach the Buddha, confess their faults, and request his
                        guidance. The bodhisattvas then reveal and confess to the Buddha their
                        failings and their doubts about being able to live up to the bodhisattva
                        ideal.</p>

                    <p tid="11">The Buddha explains the causes and conditions they created in a
                        former lifetime that have led to their current predicament. Specifically,
                        during the previous period of the Buddha Krakucchanda, these bodhisattvas
                        denigrated and slandered two monks, creating schisms and doubts in the
                        Saṅgha and the wider community. Many lifetimes of painful ripening of this
                        negative karma ensued. </p>

                    <p tid="12">The Buddha further prophesies, however, that although the
                        bodhisattvas’ negative karma will continue to ripen in subsequent lives,
                        once it is finally exhausted, during a period in which the Dharma is
                        declining, they will attain rebirth in the realm of the Buddha Amitābha.
                        Hearing this, the bodhisattvas are newly inspired and resolve not to repeat
                        their mistakes. Maitreya asks the Buddha whether they will abide by their
                        renewed commitment, and he confirms that they will. </p>

                    <p tid="13">This is followed by a lengthy series of enumerations by the Buddha,
                        in response to inquiries by Maitreya, concerning the negative consequences
                        of each fault of conduct in which the sixty bodhisattvas had engaged, as
                        well as the advantages of refraining from each one. In several instances,
                        these lists are presented first in prose form and then repeated in verse as
                        an <foreign xml:lang="fr" type="term">aide-memoire</foreign>. Maitreya’s
                        questions also prompt the Buddha to caution about the future degeneration of
                        the Dharma, when it will be corrupted by the materialistic interests of
                        teachers. He describes the pitfalls of teaching the Dharma without ridding
                        oneself of attachment to personal gain and honor. </p>

                    <p tid="14">The Buddha’s countervailing instruction is to refrain from judging
                        the veracity or quality of a Dharma teaching by the character or motivation
                        of the teacher who offers it. Śāntideva (late seventh to mid-eighth century)
                        emphasizes this point in his <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign>

                        detecting and correcting one’s own faults. The Buddha later advises Maitreya
                        that what marks someone as a follower of his teachings, and as an ordained
                        member of his community, is not the formality of vows or the semblance of
                        piety, but rather one’s cultivation of the qualities of the path, including
                        renunciation, concentration, restrained speech, and the pursuit of

                        is how to determine whether a teaching qualifies as authentic Dharma. His
                        rule, also quoted and discussed by Śāntideva, is that everything that is
                        well spoken is the speech of the Buddha, no matter what it is or by whom it
                        is offered.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-14"> See <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign> folio 11.b.

                            (referencing the same passage from Śāntideva).</note> Moreover, to
                        qualify as well spoken, an instruction must be meaningful, consistent with
                        the Dharma, and designed to reduce mental defilements, and it must laud the
                        qualities of nirvāṇa as opposed to saṃsāra. This sūtra appears to be the

                    <p tid="16">The sūtra concludes on a positive note, with the Buddha outlining
                        the ten positive attitudes that lead to rebirth in the realm of the Buddha
                        Amitāyus, which is another name for the Buddha Amitābha. This serves as a
                        valediction to his earlier prophecy of the future rebirth in Amitāyus’ realm
                        of the sixty bodhisattvas whose confessions and renewed commitments prompted
                        this teaching. In this way, <title xml:lang="en">Inspiring

                    <p tid="291">Many sūtras in the Kangyur mention the obstacles and difficulties
                        practitioners may encounter, often in the context of the degenerate future
                        times when the Dharma will be in decline. Few, however, relate in such

                        have received; (13) sūtra transmissions they have not previously received
                        never reach their ears; (14) they entirely abandon all their spiritual
                        mentors; (15) they quickly associate with evil friends; (16) they take
                        ordination on the path of austerity; (17) they hear an uninterrupted flow of
                        unpleasant words; (18) no matter where they are reborn they are born
                        skeptics; (19) in their future lives, the eight states lacking leisure will

                        enmity, generate the attitude of compassion for all beings. (3) Generate the
                        determination to preserve the sacred Dharma, without concern for life and
                        limb. (4) Develop strong dedication to the sacred Dharma, through certainty
                        that one can tolerate the profound. (5) Give rise to completely pure
                        intentions by not being stained by gain and honor. (6) Through perfect
                        recall, generate the viewpoint that the state of omniscience is extremely
                        precious. (7) Without getting discouraged, generate an attitude of respect
                        towards all beings, as if they were one’s guru. <ref cRef="F.153.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-456"/> (8) Develop the attitude of
                        not enjoying mere short-lived meditative experiences, by being certain about
                        the branches of awakening. (9) By seeing them distinctly, cultivate a wide
                        assortment of virtuous roots. (10) Abandoning conceptual constructs,
                        cultivate a state of contemplation that simply recalls the Buddha.</p>

                                    elaborate meals presented to the Saṅgha; (7) refusing more food
                                    after indicating one has eaten enough; (8) dwelling in the
                                    forest; (9) dwelling at the root of a tree; (10) dwelling in the
