            opens in Sukhāvatī, where the Blessed One Amitāyus is residing. Amitāyus addresses the
            bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, informing him that there are beings who suffer from
            illnesses and short lifespans, and introducing the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> dhāraṇī as a remedy for such painful circumstances.
            Avalokiteśvara immediately asks Amitāyus to pronounce the dhāraṇī, which the Tathāgata
            does from within a state of samādhi.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-7"/>
          <p tid="11">Following this pronouncement of the dhāraṇī proper, Amitāyus explains that the
            dhāraṇī purifies the evil deeds of someone who is pursued by the Lord of Death, and he
            describes some procedures through which the dhāraṇī can be used to extend such a
            person’s lifespan. The text goes on to describe several additional rites for the dhāraṇī
            that will restore health and bring about long life and other benefits. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-8"/>
          <p tid="12">Then, in response to a request from Avalokiteśvara, Amitāyus teaches the short
              <distinct>dhāraṇī of limitless life</distinct> and explains rites for a caitya, a
            short Amitābha sādhana together with some rites connected to it, a homa ritual, and a
            number of additional applications of the dhāraṇī rite to obtain results such as glory
            and kingship. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-9"/>
          <p tid="13">This work is one among a group of texts in the Kriyātantra section of the

              different title: <title xml:lang="en">Crown Victory of All Tathāgatas: A Ritual Manual

            </note> These four works share a similar narrative opening (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nidāna</foreign>) up through the presentation of the dhāraṇī proper, and
            several among them also share additional passages. The present text, in fact, is made up
            entirely of parallel passages from the slightly longer Toh 594.<!--<Reference Toh

              of this work is preserved in what Gregory Schopen calls the “Los Angeles Manuscript,”
              though it appears to be held currently in Japan. This is an early manuscript from
              Bamiyan-Gilgit that Schopen transcribed and translated into English in an unpublished
              work, which we are grateful to Jacob Dalton for sharing. In addition to being
              incomplete, probably due to the loss of a folio, the manuscript lacks several passages
              that are found in the Tibetan translation of Toh 597 and contains a few passages that
              are absent in that translation, including two passages that are found in Toh 594.
              Nonetheless, the Sanskrit manuscript is by and large the same work that is translated
              into Tibetan as Toh 597. More recently, the Sanskrit of the very same manuscript was
              studied by Gudrun Meltzer in a 2007 “limited distribution report” (Silk 2021, p. 108),
              to which we have not had access, as well as by Unebe Toshiya, who published the
              Sanskrit along with a Japanese translation in a 2015 article. </note> While our text

              in the Tibetan canon, the Sanskrit text is most closely parallel, though not
              identical, with the present text, Toh 595. </note>

            emanated from the Buddha’s uṣṇīṣa. Indeed,
            Uṣṇīṣavijayā is clearly depicted as a goddess in a number of short sādhanas
            included in Indian anthologies such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sādhanamāla</title>,
            compiled from the works of many authors probably during the period of the

            In the later Tibetan tradition Uṣṇīṣavijayā
            can even appear as one of a group of three
            long-life deities along with the Buddha Amitāyus and White Tārā. However, in our text,
            and indeed in all but one of the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> works in this section of the Kangyur (Toh 598), while the
            dhāraṇī itself uses the feminine vocative form throughout, the name <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> is not rendered into Tibetan in
            the feminine, and the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign>
            is not used to refer to anything apart from the name of the dhāraṇī—the dhāraṇī of
              <distinct>the crown victory</distinct>. The single instance in this text in which we
            could interpret <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> to refer
            to a goddess is a sentence in one of the rites for an Amitāyus sādhana that also
            involves reciting the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign>
            dhāraṇī. After having properly followed the rite, the text notes that “in the early
            morning at dawn you will see the face of the Bhagavatī, and she will give you whatever
            accomplishments you desire.” The name of this Bhagavatī is not mentioned in our text,

          <p tid="79">The range of possible answers to the question of what the name Uṣṇīṣavijayā refers to is enlarged even further by
            the existence of a group of related texts widely used in Southeast Asia, sharing the Pali 
            title <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Uṇhissa-vijaya-sutta</title> (or in some cases 
            simply <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Uṇhissa-vijaya</title>) but found in a 
            number of different forms, some in Pali but others in Siamese, Lao, Yuon, and Khmer. 
            Some refer at least briefly to the story of the 
            god Supratiṣṭhita (Pali Supatiṭṭhita) which, although it does not appear in the present text, is the frame story of Toh 597
            and a secondary narrative element in Toh 594. But instead of the dhāraṇī of the Sanskrit
            and Tibetan texts these Southeast Asian texts contain a set of verses (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gāthā</foreign>) 
            to be recited whose content is unrelated to that of the Sanskrit dhāraṇī. The 
            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gāthā</foreign> are also found alone in several
            ritual compilations. Even in the vernacular versions, 
            the verses are written in Pali. In these texts, in their own opening lines, it seems to be the verses themselves that
            are referred to as the Uṇhissa-vijaya.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-196">These 
              Southeast Asian texts are not included in the official Pali Canon of the Theravāda tradition and are 
              unknown in Sri Lanka. In mainland Southeast Asia, however, they are popular in rituals
              for extending life and in funeral rites. Whether they reflect the diffusion
              of texts and practices directly from India prior to the relatively recent evolution
              of Theravāda orthodoxy, or were transmitted via Chinese along with Chinese migrations
              and cultural influence in the region, remains an open question. For
              a detailed study of these texts and their possible origins, see Cicuzza (ed.) 2018.</note>

            it was translated into Tibetan by the Indian scholar Dharmasena and the Tibetan

              short to correspond with the text identified in the Phangthangma as having 120 ślokas,
              and Toh 598 is an unlikely candidate because, while it shares the opening narrative
              with the other texts in this set, it seems to represent a separate, and later, ritual
              system. The Phangthangma also lists what may be a copy of the dhāraṇī alone, outside
              of the framework of a sūtra (Phangthangma, p. 31). The other imperial catalog, the
              Denkarma, lists only the primary <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> dhāraṇī text, identified clearly as the text included in the
              later canons as Toh 597 by its full title in that catalog: the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-uṣṇīṣavijayā-dhāraṇī</title> (Lalou 1953,
              p. 327).</note> Thus, along with the records of Uṣṇīṣavijayā texts at Dunhuang, its
            presence in the Phangthangma catalog at the very least indicates the early presence of
            parts of the Uṣṇīṣavijayā corpus, including not just the dhāraṇī but also some of its
            associated rites, in Tibet. </p>

            consulted, with the same title and only minor variants; all recensions are alike in
            lacking a colophon. We have also consulted Hidas’ edition and translation of the
            surviving Sanskrit <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Uṣṇīṣavijayā-dhāraṇī</title> text for the
            passages that are parallel with the present text.</p>

          <p tid="76">The main dhāraṇī is not identical in every detail across the five
            different versions in the Degé Kangyur (Toh 594–598), and the existence of further
            variations across different Kangyurs and versions in extra-canonical collections further
            complicates the picture. Reference to the dhāraṇī as presented in Hidas’ edition of the
            Sanskrit yields useful orthographic confirmation, but may be misleading as a model given
            that the ten different Nepalese Sanskrit manuscripts on which it is based are of much
            later date than any of the present Tibetan witnesses. Here and in the other works in the
            group we have therefore chosen to transcribe the dhāraṇī as it appears in the Degé
            version of each text, making only minor choices of orthography and adding annotations to
            point out the most significant discrepancies.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-183"/>
          <p tid="77">One noticeable difference across both Tibetan and Sanskrit versions of the
            dhāraṇī is the presence or absence of the syllable <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign> at the beginning of certain phrases. In the present work and in Toh 594,
            596, and 597 there are only three such <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>
            syllables, while in Toh 598 <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign> appears no less than nine times, as it does in Hidas’
            edition from Sanskrit sources and in extra-canonical liturgies. The Tibetan translation
            of Toh 598 was made at a significantly later date than the other works of the group, and
            may possibly signal a change in usage that is also reflected in the Nepalese Sanskrit
            texts of even later date. This is corroborated by the absence of extra <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s in the Dunhuang manuscripts. The colophon of Toh 597
            found in the Phukdrak (phug brag) Kangyur includes a note claiming that the texts with
            only three <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s are to be considered more
              correct.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-184">The text is F 631, Phukdrak
              Kangyur, vol. 117 (rgyud, dza), F.224.a–231.a. It should be noted, however, that the
              version of the dhāraṇī preserved in F 631 differs from the dhāraṇī in the present text
              much more substantially than any of the versions in the mainstream Kangyurs.</note>
            The note also states that although there may have been Sanskrit sources with as
            many as nine <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s, the twelfth-century translator
            Sumpa Lotsāwa<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-039-185">Probably Sumpa Lotsāwa
              Dharma Yontan (sum pa lo tsA ba dhar ma yon tan), a translator and teacher of Sakya
              Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen, but possibly his uncle, also called Sumpa Lotsāwa, Palchok
              Dangpö Dorje (dpal mchog dang po’i rdor rje). Both studied in Nepal. See <ref target="https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Sumpa-Lotsawa-Darma-Yonten/1726">Treasury of Lives</ref>.</note> reported that all the Sanskrit texts he had seen
            contained only three, and that the Sanskrit manuscripts of the texts held at Sakya
            monastery had no more than that. Because Sumpa Lotsāwa is known to have lived and
            studied in Nepal, his comment on the “correct” number of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s in the Sanskrit manuscripts available to him offers a glimpse of the
            evolution of the text in the Nepalese tradition. As Hidas’ edition of the Nepalese
            manuscripts suggests, the number of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s in the
            dhāraṇī seem to proliferate, eventually reaching a total of nine.</p>

              been some textual corruption. What has been rendered in Tibetan as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phug</foreign> seems to be <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhya</foreign> in the Sanskrit parallel; perhaps the Tibetan

              The passage in bold has been incongruously lifted from its proper place several lines
              down in the text and added here. The Sanskrit passage lacks this error but also
              includes several additional words absent in the Tibetan. However, as the Sanskrit and
              Tibetan texts are not identical in other places in this parallel passage either, and
              since the Tibetan text makes perfect sense without these additional elements, we have
              not taken the liberty of adding them in the English translation. The Sanskrit passage,

                non-Buddhist traditions into modern times. In Buddhist esoteric rites, the ritual
                offerings are made repeatedly, with each throw accompanied by a single repetition of
                the respective mantra. </term>
