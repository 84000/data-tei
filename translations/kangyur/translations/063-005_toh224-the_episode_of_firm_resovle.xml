                    feelings, he rushes out of town with an empty begging bowl—but finds himself being pursued by a replica of the merchant’s daughter emanated by the Buddha. Distressed, the bodhisattva inquires about
                    the nature of these events to the Blessed One, who then gives a discourse on nonduality by focusing on the erroneous manner in which certain bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, laymen, and laywomen take the path as a
                    means of escape. At its conclusion, eight great śrāvakas each praise the discourse as engendering their own foremost quality in others.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Episode of Dṛḍhādhyāśaya</title> is a relatively short sūtra that begins by introducing the bodhisattva-monk Dṛḍhādhyāśaya, who instantly falls in love with a merchant’s daughter while on an alms round. He tries to remedy his
                        desire with thoughts of the unpleasantness of her body but fails, and so removes himself from her presence without receiving alms. The Buddha, who is nearby, is aware of Dṛḍhādhyāśaya's situation and, in
                        order to tame him, chases him with an apparition of the beautiful girl. The bodhisattva flees in fright, but the apparition catches up with him and tells him that fleeing will not help—only
                        relinquishing his desire will. Distressed, the bodhisattva Dṛḍhādhyāśaya goes to the Buddha to request a teaching through which he can understand the nature of these events. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-063-005-49"/>
                    <p tid="10">Now that the bodhisattva Dṛḍhādhyāśaya is primed for such a teaching, the Buddha delivers a concise yet uncompromising and profound discourse on nonduality using the analogies of a magical
                        illusion, a dream, a mirage, a reflection, the son of a barren woman, and a visual hallucination. Each analogy is used to indicate the erroneous way certain bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, laymen, and
                        laywomen present in the audience perceive things that do not really exist, and how they analyze whether they should take up or discard them, affirm or negate them. Of such practitioners the Buddha
                        repeatedly states, “I do not say of such foolish people that they are cultivating the path; they should be said to be on the wrong course.” He declares that only a nondualistic approach is the
                        correct way to practice: from the standpoint of the dharmadhātu one should not take up, discard, negate, or affirm any phenomenon. </p>

                        inventories, but in both, as well as in the lists of canonical texts compiled by Chomden Rikpai Raltri and Butön in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries respectively, the corresponding text is

                            but a possibility remains either that they are referring to a different work, or that the present text is an extract from a longer original. Hermann-Pfandt points out that no longer text of
                            similar title has been identified anywhere. The catalogs of the Degé (F.130.a) and Narthang (F.98.a) Kangyurs both mention the discrepancy in length compared to the early inventories, and
                            while the Degé catalog mentions that early inventories described the text as having two chapters (although in fact none of the extant inventories do so), the Narthang catalog implies that it
                            still does have two chapters (although this is not the case in any extant version, including the one in the Narthang).
