                    Śākyamuni and his disciple Śāriputra on the faults and unwanted consequences
                    associated with the corrupted discipline of monks, and on the ways to apply
                    oneself to the authentic Dharma. While discussing a variety of topics related to
                    monastic conduct, the Buddha gives several prophecies about the future decline
                    of the Dharma caused by the behavior of immoral monks. Throughout the sūtra,
                    great emphasis is placed on the realization of the nature of emptiness and the
                    view that does not dwell on any phenomenon. </p>

                                <p tid="2">When Śāriputra voices amazement at how the Buddha uses words to point out the
                                        inexpressible ways in which nothing has true existence, the Buddha 
                                        responds with an uncompromising teaching on how the lack of true existence and the absence of a self
                                        are indeed not simply philosophical views but the very cornerstone of
                                        the Dharma. To have understood, realized, and applied them fully is the main
                                        quality by which someone may be considered a member of the Saṅgha
                                        and authorized to teach others and to receive offerings. Those who
                                        persist in perceiving anything—even elements of the path and its results—as having any kind of true existence 
                                        are committing the most serious of all violations of discipline (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">śīla</foreign>),
                                        and since they fail to follow the Buddha’s core teaching in this way 
                                        they should not even be considered his followers.
                                        The Buddha’s dialog with Śāriputra continues on the consequences of monks’ violating their discipline
                                        more broadly, and he gives several prophecies about the future decline of the
                                        Dharma that will be caused by the misbehavior of such monks.</p>

                                                General Sūtra section of the Degé Kangyur and is
                                                structured in eight chapters followed by a long
                                                epilogue. Although it purports to be a text on
                                        discipline and how it is violated, its main doctrinal thrust is to set out 
                                        a view of Buddhist practice based uncompromisingly on the ultimate
                                        view of emptiness. To practice or teach others in ways that 
                                        do not fully embrace that ultimate view turns out to be the transgression 
                                        of discipline to which the sūtra’s title refers, and the Buddha goes even 
                                        further in insisting that those who follow such mistaken ways 
                                        are not only failing to follow his teachings correctly but are also not 
                                        qualified to receive offerings and are not even to be considered 
                                        members of the Buddhist saṅgha.</p>

                                        <p tid="615">The sūtra begins with Śāriputra expressing
                                                his astonished admiration of how the Buddha has been able to formulate and express teachings 
                                                about what is intrinsically inexpressible—the nature of his awakening to how phenomena 
                                                are uncompounded, unarisen, and devoid of distinguishing marks and characteristics. 
                                                The Buddha then uses various analogies to 
                                                reinforce how paradoxical it is indeed that there can be any teachings at all on emptiness free of apprehending, and he
                                                elaborates on the ultimate nature of phenomena. </p>

                                        <p tid="616">Next, the Buddha differentiates between virtuous friends and evil ones,
                                                emphasizing that evil
                                                friends are those who cause others to apprehend
                                                phenomena mistakenly. This teaching is followed by a
                                                discussion on the meaning of recollecting the
                                                Buddha, <!--see Toh 9 UT22084-026-001-5612 to UT22084-026-001-5618 -->which is described here as a state in which
                                                all directing of the attention on an object or notion of any kind is avoided. The Buddha
                                                then explains how a virtuous friend must teach
                                                others, insisting on the nature of the correct view.
                                                He elaborates on the meaning of the noble saṅgha,
                                                revealing that there will be monks in the future who
                                                will deceive householders with wrong teachings in
                                                the pursuit of their own livelihood. The Buddha also
                                                warns against the many groups of non-Buddhists who
                                                will reject the unsurpassed and perfect awakening of
                                                the buddhas, and thus cause the Dharma Jewel to
                                                disappear. </p>

                                        <p tid="12">This is followed by a detailed presentation of
                                                ten faults that lead monks who violate their discipline
                                                to rebirth in the lower realms. The Buddha gives
                                                predictions of monks who will teach an impure Dharma
                                                in the future, supporting these predictions with a
                                                lengthy discussion of badly behaved monks who became
                                                highly influential in the past and spread mistaken
                                                interpretations of the Dharma in the world.
                                                Śākyamuni then discusses several of his past lives
                                                in which he worshiped and pleased countless other
                                                buddhas with the wish to attain awakening but
                                                lacked the view of emptiness free of apprehending.
                                                Finally, the epilogue highlights the need to abandon
                                                all clinging to the view of a self, and it cautions
                                                against the numerous non-Buddhists and badly behaved monks
                                                who will lead immature beings astray. </p>

                                        <p tid="13">As the title suggests, one of the primary
                                                concerns of this sūtra is the identification and
                                                repudiation of those who have violated their discipline.
                                                The Buddha makes it clear that what determines
                                                the purity of one’s discipline is 
                                                not just how one maintains the formal vows
                                                one has taken, but is even more a question of whether one has a proper  
                                                understanding of emptiness in terms of the nonapprehending of
                                                phenomena, as he has taught.  </p>

                                        <p tid="619">Not to follow properly the teachings 
                                                he has been at pains to formulate on this crucial point is
                                                a betrayal of them, to the point that people who fail to take full 
                                                notice of them are not worthy of offerings made to the saṅgha, and are not to be considered
                                                his followers at all. The Buddha argues throughout 
                                                that such people must be excluded from the monastic saṅgha, because
                                                their presence compromises one of the saṅgha’s
                                                primary functions as the proper recipient of gifts
                                                that are given through faith. In this regard the sūtra makes frequent mention of the
                                                necessary qualities seen as criteria for the worthiness of the saṅgha 
                                                to be an object of refuge overall, for the worthiness of members of the saṅgha to be  
                                                recipients of offerings individually, and by extension for their worthiness 
                                                to teach and guide others—these qualities being most often mentioned in the context
                                                of their absence in those who violate discipline.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-063-001-1011"> The 
                                                        usual formulation of these qualities comprises a pair of terms, one of which
                                                        describes what qualities are positively present and the other what negative 
                                                        attributes have been eliminated. While the second of the two 
                                                        elements—the quality of being rid of hindrances—is summarized  
                                                        throughout by the term “liberated”
                                                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">grol</foreign>), the terminology used for 
                                                        the first element—summarizing the positive attributes—evolves as the text unfolds.
                                                        In the first few chapters we see mentions of “having knowledge and being liberated”

                                                        seventh chapters the equivalent becomes being “coherent and liberated”

                                                        the terms used are “equipped and liberated” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan pa

                                                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rigs pa dang grol ba</foreign>) are also used as

                                                Dharma. The worst of them are those members
                                                of the Buddhist saṅgha who teach a corrupted Dharma
                                                based on their misunderstanding or rejection of the
                                                doctrine of emptiness as nonapprehending. The
                                                severity of the negative karmic consequences that
                                                these beings incur is compounded by the fact that
                                                their teachings lead beings further from awakening
                                                and result in the corruption, suppression, and
                                                destruction of the Dharma.</p>

                                                points to abandon them: To abandon desire, engage your attention on

                                                abandon delusion, engage your attention on dependent origination.
                                                Come, monk. Engage your attention on pure moral discipline. Engage your attention on
                                                the distinguishing marks related to absorption. Engage your attention on pure
                                                insight. Direct your effort toward the four
                                                concentrations. Reflect upon and work to acquire the
                                                result you should attain. Engage your attention without considering
                                                unwholesome qualities. Engage your attention and rely on virtuous
                                                qualities. Strive to cultivate the path. Bear those
                                                distinguishing marks that indicate virtuous qualities perfectly in
                                                mind and engage your attention on the fact that nirvāṇa is
                                                happiness and peace. Work to acquire this view, so
                                                that you can attain nirvāṇa.’ When a monk instructs and teaches another 
                                                with such statements and also says, ‘Engage your attention on purity,’ 
                                                he is encouraging him to hold a
                                                mistaken understanding. The notion that this is to view
                                                things correctly will encourage him to view things wrongly.</p>

                                                This teaching that is without entities has no
                                                distinguishing marks, has no characteristics, and is not engaged by attention. 
                                                It is because it has no distinguishing marks,

                                                has no characteristics, and is not engaged by attention. Why is that?
                                                Because the buddhas are not something on which attention is engaged

                                                nor through wisdom, nor through knowledge, nor through the absence of knowledge. Why is that?
                                                Because the thus-gone ones are without designations, are

                                                even though there are no persons is surely on
                                                account of worldly convention. The Thus-Gone One
                                                never lies concerning worldly convention, and even
                                                though he uses the term <distinct>person</distinct>
                                                in many of his discourses, there is never anything
                                                false about the authentic truth of the Thus-Gone
                                                One.’ If someone were to say this, Śāriputra, I
                                                would tell them that the Thus-Gone One teaches that
                                                all phenomena are ownerless and without substance.
                                                The Thus-Gone One gives explanations using worldly
                                                convention, but such conventions do not ultimately
                                                belong to the noble ones. If no one is comparable to
                                                the Thus-Gone One, how could any gods, nāgas, or
                                                yakṣas be superior to him? It is impossible for
                                                someone to be more learned, more refined, more
                                                intelligent, or more insightful than the Thus-Gone
                                                One. Śāriputra, if no sentient being understands the
                                                inconceivable words of the Buddha, how could the
                                                Thus-Gone One be equated with a self and the
                                                world?</p>

                                                do not argue with the world. Śāriputra, I expel

                                                would not be a member of a non-Buddhist order.

                                                ‘there is no action,’ the Thus-Gone One would not
                                                teach the absence of action. Śāriputra, even if I

                                                would not adhere to wrong views. Śāriputra, one who

                                                become the correct view. Those who perceive by means

                                                million buddhas, who have reached definitive
                                                awakening, he has developed great insight. The monk
                                                Pūrṇa is therefore the best teacher of the Dharma
                                                propounded by the thus-gone ones. Śāriputra, even if

                                                Because he is a hearer of mine who always teaches

                                                will disparage monks who teach about emptiness. Why
                                                is that? Because they are not trained, and because
                                                they will be scared when they hear about the
                                                Buddha’s teachings on emptiness.</p>

                                                them. Instead, out of ignorance, they will conclude
                                                that they are not the Buddha’s words.’ Aware of my
                                                intentions, the mendicant Gautama has informed his
                                                hearers about that future situation. He has given
                                                them this teaching to protect them in the future, to
                                                generate enthusiasm in those who are learned, and to
                                                bring clarity about that situation. Since he has now
                                                expounded this teaching to the world with its gods,

                                <p>“Prātimokṣa” is the name
                                                  given to the code of conduct binding on monks and
                                                  nuns. The term can be used to refer both to the
                                                  disciplinary rules themselves and to the texts
                                                  from the Vinaya that contain them. There are
                                                  multiple recensions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prātimokṣa</title>, each
                                                  transmitted by a different monastic fraternity in
                                                  ancient and medieval India. Three remain living
                                                  traditions, one of them the Mūlasarvāstivāda
                                                  Vinaya of Tibetan Buddhism. Though the numbers of
                                                  rules vary across the different recensions, they
                                                  are all organized according to the same principles
                                                  and with the same disciplinary categories. It is
                                                  customary for monastics to recite the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prātimokṣa Sūtra</title>
                                                  fortnightly. According to some Mahāyāna sūtras, a

                                                  bodhisattvas, which are based on bodhisattva

                                                  sought to rival the Buddha in his day: Purāṇa
                                                  Kāśyapa, who negated the effects of actions, good
                                                  or evil; Māskārin Gośāliputra, who taught a theory
                                                  of randomness, negating causality; Saṃjāyin
                                                  Vairaṭiputra, who was agnostic in refusing to
                                                  maintain any opinion about anything; Kakuda
                                                  Kātyāyana, who taught a materialism in which there
                                                  was no such thing as killer or killed, but only
                                                  transformations of <term rend="ignore">elements</term>; Ajita Keśakambala,
                                                  who taught a more extreme nihilism regarding
                                                  everything except the four main <term rend="ignore">elements</term>; and
                                                  Nirgrantha Jñātiputra, otherwise known as
                                                  Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, who taught the
                                                  doctrine of indeterminism (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">syādvāda</foreign>),
                                                  considering all things in terms of “maybe.” They
                                                  were allowed to proclaim their doctrines
                                                  unchallenged until a famous assembly at Śrāvastī,
                                                  where the Buddha eclipsed them with a display of
