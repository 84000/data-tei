                                                epilogue. The sūtra begins with Śāriputra expressing
                                                his amazement at the Buddha Śākyamuni’s teachings on

                                                indescribable. The Buddha then uses various analogies to illustrate the greatness of the teachings on emptiness free of apprehending, and he
                                                elaborates on the ultimate nature of phenomena. </p>

                                        <p tid="11">Next, the Buddha differentiates between evil and
                                                virtuous friends, emphasizing that evil
                                                friends are those who cause others to apprehend
                                                phenomena mistakenly. This teaching is followed by a
                                                discussion on the meaning of recollecting the
                                                Buddha, which is described here as a state in which
                                                all mental engagement has been pacified. The Buddha
                                                then explains how a virtuous friend must teach
                                                others, insisting on the nature of the correct view.
                                                He elaborates on the meaning of the noble saṅgha,
                                                revealing that there will be monks in the future who
                                                will deceive householders with wrong teachings in
                                                the pursuit of their own livelihood. The Buddha also
                                                warns against the many groups of non-Buddhists who
                                                will reject the unsurpassed and perfect awakening of
                                                the buddhas, and thus cause the Dharma Jewel to
                                                disappear. </p>

                                        <p tid="12">This is followed by a lengthy presentation of
                                                ten faults that lead monks with corrupted discipline
                                                to rebirth in the lower realms. The Buddha gives
                                                predictions of monks who will teach an impure Dharma
                                                in the future, supporting these predictions with a
                                                lengthy discussion of corrupt monks who became
                                                highly influential in the past and spread mistaken
                                                interpretations of the Dharma in the world.
                                                Śākyamuni then discusses several of his past lives
                                                in which he worshiped and pleased countless other
                                                buddhas with the wish to attain awakening but
                                                lacked the view of emptiness free of apprehending.
                                                Finally, the epilogue highlights the need to abandon
                                                all clinging to the view of a self, and it cautions
                                                against the numerous non-Buddhists and corrupt monks
                                                who will lead immature beings astray. </p>

                                                concerns of this sūtra is the identification and
                                                exclusion from the saṅgha of those whose discipline
                                                is corrupted by wrong views. Throughout the sūtra,
                                                the Buddha argues that it is critical that such
                                                beings be excluded from the monastic saṅgha, because
                                                their presence compromises one of the saṅgha’s
                                                primary functions as the proper recipient of gifts
                                                that are given through faith. When such beings hide
                                                in the monastic ranks, we are told, they are no
                                                better than thieves and robbers who steal the

                                                realization of emptiness as the nonapprehending of

                                                whether or not one’s discipline is pure or
                                                corrupted—not simply the commitment to and
                                                maintenance of formal vows. This realization of the
                                                doctrine of nonapprehending determines whether or
                                                not someone possesses the “lineage” (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gotra</foreign>;

                                                to attain awakening. Here, in contrast to the
                                                presentation of this concept in the sūtras and
                                                treatises on the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathāgata­garbha</foreign>, the Buddha
                                                clearly argues that beings can gain or lose this
                                                lineage. While the Buddha stops short of arguing
                                                that there are beings who will lose this lineage and
                                                  <emph>never</emph> attain the state of a buddha,
                                                he does argue that there are certain beings who
                                                incur karmic consequences so severe as to delay
                                                indefinitely any true progress on the path to
                                                awakening. Among these beings we find those members
                                                of the Buddhist saṅgha who teach a corrupted Dharma
                                                based on their misunderstanding or rejection of the
                                                doctrine of emptiness as nonapprehending. The
                                                severity of the negative karmic consequences that
                                                these beings incur is compounded by the fact that
                                                their teachings lead beings further from liberation
                                                and result in the corruption, suppression, and
                                                destruction of the Dharma.</p>

                                                abandon delusion, engage your attention on dependent origination.
                                                Come, monk. Engage your attention on pure moral discipline. Engage your attention on
                                                the distinguishing marks related to absorption. Engage your attention on pure
                                                insight. Direct your effort toward the four
                                                concentrations. Reflect upon and work to acquire the
                                                result you should attain. Engage your attention without considering
                                                nonvirtuous qualities. Engage your attention and rely on virtuous
                                                qualities. Strive to cultivate the path. Bear those

                                                mind and engage your attention on the fact that nirvāṇa is
                                                happiness and peace. Work to acquire this view, so
                                                that you can attain nirvāṇa.’ When a monk instructs and teaches another 
                                                with such statements and also says, ‘Engage your attention on purity,’ 
                                                he is encouraging him to hold a
                                                mistaken understanding. The notion that this is to view
                                                things correctly will encourage him to view things wrongly.</p>

                                                Because a phenomenon that lacks entities lacks

                                                Because the buddhas should not be contemplated on
                                                the basis of physical marks, concepts, thoughts,

                                                Because the thus-gone ones lack imputations, which

                                                say one sees when one looks and sees the Thus-Gone
                                                One? It is the absence of distinguishing marks, wishes,
                                                elaboration, and clinging—and one never apprehends
                                                any conventions. One also does not entertain
                                                thoughts about nirvāṇa. Why is that? Because,

                                                nirvāṇa. I do not think in terms of nirvāṇa, and I
                                                do not delight in it, so why would I say that you
                                                should entertain thoughts about that you should
                                                think in terms of nirvāṇa, or that you should
                                                delight in nirvāṇa? Śāriputra, if someone apprehends
                                                nirvāṇa, I say one should not go forth as their

                                                conventions, but such conventions do not ultimately
                                                belong to the noble ones. If no one is comparable to

                                                Śāriputra, since many beings have not understood the
                                                absence of persons and entities that the Thus-Gone
                                                One has realized and taught, they will not engage in
                                                this Dharma and Vinaya, and they will go to the
                                                lower realms. Why is that? Śāriputra, even if I
                                                taught the words of non-Buddhists, the Thus-Gone One
                                                would not be a member of a non-Buddhist order.
                                                Śāriputra, even if I were to make nihilist
                                                assertions, the Thus-Gone One would not stray toward
                                                the wrong path. Śāriputra, even if I claimed that
                                                everything is without a cause, the Thus-Gone One
                                                  <tei:ref cRef="F.21.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-063-001-849"/> would not teach the
                                                lack of causes. Śāriputra, even if I said the words
                                                ‘there is no action,’ the Thus-Gone One would not
                                                teach the absence of action. Śāriputra, even if I
                                                were to express a wrong view, the Thus-Gone One
                                                would not adhere to wrong views. Śāriputra, one who
                                                understands a wrong view as a wrong view has the
                                                correct view. Śāriputra, a wrong view will never
                                                become the correct view. Those who perceive by means
                                                of a view will never understand or see.</p>

                                                not frightening are frightening. Śāriputra, at that
                                                time, those monks will bear the wrong impression
                                                that virtuous qualities are of no benefit and
                                                nonvirtuous qualities are beneficial. Śāriputra,

                                                engage in the three roots of nonvirtue. Śāriputra,
                                                for the sake of worldly, material things, they will
                                                teach householders discourses that contain the
                                                foundation of the superior training of discipline
                                                and discourses on <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātimokṣa</foreign> that I taught to

                                                them. Instead, out of ignorance, they will conclude
                                                that they are not the Buddha’s words.’ Aware of my
                                                intentions, the mendicant Gautama has informed his
                                                hearers about that future situation. He has given
                                                them this teaching to protect them in the future, to
                                                generate enthusiasm in those who are learned, and to
                                                bring clarity about that situation. Since he has now
                                                expounded this teaching to the world with its gods,

                                                  from the Vinaya that contain them. There are

                                                  Vinaya of Tibetan Buddhism. Though the numbers of
