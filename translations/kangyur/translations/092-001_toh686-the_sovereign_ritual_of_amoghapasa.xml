                                                appears in both peaceful and wrathful iconographies. He is sometimes referred to in the text as
                                                Avalokiteśvara-Amoghapāśa, as the two are considered identical. One could perhaps say that Amoghapāśa
                                                is distilled from Avalokiteśvara, with certain qualities of the latter being enhanced in the former,
                                                in particular his “unfailing” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">amogha</foreign>) ability to
                                                rescue beings drowning in the ocean of saṃsāra by means of his namesake “noose” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pāśa</foreign>). The form of Amoghapāśa who, in addition to a
                                                noose, holds a goad is similarly called Amoghāṅkuśa (Unfailing Goad). As is true of the Kriyātantras
                                                in general, the names of Amoghapāśa apply equally to the mantras that correspond to the different
                                                deities. Thus, in the AP we find mantras that include expanded or paraphrased renderings of the name
                                                Amoghapāśa, depending on the specific form and function of the deity, such as Amoghāvalokita­pāśa
                                                (Amogha-Gaze-Noose), Amoghavilokita (Amogha-Gaze), or Adbhutāvalokitāmogha (Wondrous-Amogha-Gaze).</p>

                                        <p tid="9">As a Kriyātantra, the AP firmly adheres to Mahāyāna principles and declares itself, explicitly and
                                                implicitly, to be part of the Mahāyāna system. The Mahāyāna philosophical tenets reflected in the
                                                tantras of this class tend to fall into the category of Yogācāra rather than Madhyamaka, as it is the
                                                illusory aspect of things and its corollary, the ability to produce miraculous displays, that is
                                                prominent in these texts. The efficacy of the Kriyā <term type="ignore">ritual</term> is itself
                                                founded upon the notion of the indivisibility of mind, mantra, and deity.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-6"> A deity mantra, regarded as the heart essence of the deity, is

                                                AP’s Yogācāra affiliation is also confirmed by explicit statements such as “If [the <term type="ignore">practitioner</term>] casts the seeds among the leaders of assemblies, they will
                                                become followers of Yogācāra.”</p>

                                        <p tid="11">Dating the AP in its present form is complicated by the fact that it may be a compilation of
                                                Amoghapāśa materials that originally existed as independent but closely related <term type="ignore">ritual</term> texts. The section of the AP referred to as part 1 in our translation still
                                                exists as an independent but slightly different text that is included in the Tibetan canon with the

                                                originally circulated independently of the AP and was later compiled along with other materials into

                                                once independent of one another is further supported by the fact that the main dhāraṇī mantra is
                                                taught in the text no less than three times,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-10"> The mantra

                                                taught in part 1 and another two times in the remaining part of the text, suggesting that the entire
                                                text could be a compilation of at least three independent works. As they all are centered around the
                                                same dhāraṇī, they could almost be regarded as different variations on the same theme. On all three
                                                occasions, the dhāraṇī in question is referred to as Amogharāja (Amogha King), the “heart essence of
                                                Amoghapāśa” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">
                            <term type="ignore">amogha</term>­pāśa­hṛdaya</foreign>), and a “maṇḍala of liberation.” But the structure of the
                                                text is far more complex than this, with hundreds of minor <term type="ignore">rites</term> grouped in
                                                larger interrelated units. The compiled materials seem to be not always fully integrated, nor is it
                                                always clear where a particular set of <term type="ignore">rites</term> ends and another begins.

                                                nature of the text thus makes it difficult to arrive at anything but an approximate date of its

Alternative classifications in this group of tantras

                                                practices of the supramundane (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">lokottara</foreign>) type,

                                                concepts in the Kriyātantras. As this concept is absent in the (possibly older) part 1 but prominent
                                                in part 2 of the AP, it probably entered the Kriyā practice system around the time when part 2 was
                                                being composed and might have been introduced in this text for the first time. The term defines the
                                                Kriyā pantheon of tathāgatas and other uṣṇīṣa deities,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-16">
                                                        Uṣṇīṣa deities, such as the celestial tathāgatas or cakravartin deities, are inaccessible to
                                                        ordinary senses. They are sometimes described as emanating from the uṣṇīṣa of the Buddha, and
                                                        they themselves are depicted with an uṣṇīṣa on their head, signifying complete and perfect
                                                        buddhahood.</note> who are otherwise grouped according to specific families, by introducing an
                                                essential cohesion among them and among all supramundane Kriyā practices. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kulasāmānya</foreign> has two functions, one classificatory and
                                                the other hermeneutic. As a qualifier, the term is most often combined with <term type="ignore">ritual</term> terms such as “accomplishment,” “maṇḍala of liberation,” or “<term type="ignore">rite</term>” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">karman</foreign>). The
                                                concept is intrinsically soteriological inasmuch as all tathāgata families share in the same ultimate
                                                nature, the dharmakāya, and so are subsumed within buddhahood. Thus, regardless of which deity family
                                                or practice one accomplishes, one automatically accomplishes all tathāgata families, is blessed by all
                                                of them, and enters the samaya bond with all of them. This convergence is called the “sameness of all
                                                tathāgata families” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sarva­<term type="ignore">tathāgata</term>­kula­sāmānya</foreign>) or, in short, the “sameness of families” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kulasāmānya</foreign>). Any deity or mantra practice that leads
                                                to full buddhahood is, by definition, kulasāmānya, and, inversely, any practice that is kulasāmānya
                                                leads to full buddhahood. The broadness of the concept allows for variations in translating <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sāmānya</foreign> (“sameness”) depending on context. For
                                                example, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kula­sāmānya­tattva­<term type="ignore">siddhi</term>
                        </foreign> could be translated as “the realization of the reality of the
                                                        <emph>sameness</emph> of all the families.” <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Kula­sāmānya­samayānupraveśa</foreign> could be translated, descriptively, as “entering the
                                                samaya bond with all the families <emph>equally</emph>.” The term becomes more difficult to translate
                                                when used strictly as an adjective, as, for example, in the phrase “<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sarva­<term type="ignore">tathāgata</term>­kula­sāmānya</foreign> rite” that
                                                describes a rite (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kalpa</foreign>) that simply falls into the
                                                category of kula­sāmānya. One way out of the problem is to translate this phrase as “a rite that is
                                                        <emph>shared</emph> by all tathāgata families.” This translation, however, could be
                                                misleading, as most practices and <term type="ignore">rites</term> described as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kula­sāmānya</foreign> are actually family-specific, as is the
                                                case in the AP, where virtually all of them belong to the lotus family. It is helpful to understand
                                                that being family-specific does not preclude being kula­sāmānya—a family-specific <term type="ignore">rite</term> or practice is kula­sāmānya if it results in an accomplishment that establishes
                                                the samaya bond with all the families. Thus, it is only when a practice is fully accomplished that
                                                family divisions are transcended, and one truly realizes the kula­sāmānya. </p>

                                                unique qualities or aspects of buddhahood. Thus, when the term is applied to the lotus family, it
                                                refers specifically to the “unfailing” activities associated with this family. When the term is used

                                                There is only one complete Sanskrit manuscript (China Library of Nationalities, manuscript 69),<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-23"> This undated manuscript was written in the Māgadhī
                                                        script, possibly in Nepal, and appears to be not more than a few hundred years old. It was

                                                (Kimura 2015). The transcript, however, covers only part of the manuscript, from the beginning to
                                                folio 97 (out of the 162 folios), and the edition, still in process, consists only of a short section
                                                from folio 97 to folio 101. The names of the Tibetan translators of the AP, described in the final

                                                The same colophon gives the names of two later translators, both active in the fourteenth century,

                                                canonical translation. The English draft was prepared from the Sanskrit manuscript and its partial
                                                transcript and edition mentioned above, and it was later checked against the Tibetan translation in

                                                The Sanskrit text was carefully compared to the Tibetan witnesses so that the resulting English
                                                translation reflects the most plausible readings available. All substantive variants have been

                                                manuscript. The Tibetan canon preserves a version of the text that is substantially longer, consisting
                                                of about 102 Degé folio sides of material,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-27"> Corresponding

                                                translation. At several points the Tibetan is rendered in verse while the corresponding Sanskrit is
                                                not, in which case we have followed the Sanskrit and translated as prose. Our translation does include
                                                passages from the Sanskrit manuscript that are absent in the Tibetan, but these are rather short, the
                                                longest being about two folios of the Sanskrit manuscript, and the junctures where the two versions
                                                fall out of alignment are indicated in the notes. The Chinese canonical translation represents a
                                                version of the AP that is shorter than both the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions. The differences in
                                                composition between all three versions are listed in the collation tables in Kimura 1997.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-28"> See pp. 6–11.</note>

                                        <p tid="22">One particular challenge in preparing this translation was the precise identification of the
                                                various mantras that are repeatedly referred to in the text by a name or a descriptive phrase shared
                                                by more than one mantra—the same name or epithet, notably “heart essence of Amoghapāśa,” may refer to
                                                different mantras. Some of the confusion should perhaps be attributed to the fact that the AP is a
                                                compilation with a cumulative nomenclature that had not been completely integrated or fully
                                                harmonized. For ease of cross-referencing, the mantras are given the numbers corresponding to those in
                                                Kimura 1998,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-092-001-30"> The numbers correspond only to the part of
                                                        the text included in Kimura 1998 (later superseded by Kimura 2015), which is about half of the
                                                        text. For the remaining part, the numbers continue sequentially from those in the first part.
                                                        Unlike in Kimura’s edition, where the numbers are inserted before the mantra’s homage, they
                                                        are here inserted before the section to be repeated during recitation.</note> but without a
                                                comprehensive table of mantra concordances it would be impossible to consistently decide which
                                                specific mantra is referred to in a particular context.</p>

                                                some sections of the Tibetan text, the page numbers from Kimura do not always appear in sequential
