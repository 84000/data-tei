                    assembly of monks, elsewhere in Śrāvastī the eminent householder Vīradatta hosts a meeting with five
                    hundred householders to discuss certain questions regarding the practice of the Great Vehicle.
                    Hoping to resolve these questions, Vīradatta and the householders decide to approach the Buddha in
                    Anāthapiṇḍada’s pleasure garden. There the Buddha explains how bodhisattvas should engender the
                    spirit of great compassion while not being attached to the body or to enjoyments, and he then
                    instructs the householders on how bodhisattvas should examine the impermanence and impurity of the
                    body. This prose teaching is followed by a set of verses that reiterate how the body is impure and
                    impermanent and that elucidate the process of karma and its effects. As a result of this teaching,
                    Vīradatta and the five hundred householders attain the acceptance that phenomena are unborn. They
                    then proclaim, in a well-known series of verses, the merits of aspiring for the awakening to
                    buddhahood. The Buddha smiles, predicting that Vīradatta and the five hundred householders will
                    attain spiritual awakening. The sūtra concludes with the Buddha telling Ānanda about the name of
                    this Dharma discourse.</p>

                            in the Tibetan region at the beginning of the ninth century (see Lalou 1927 and Nattier
                            2003, 31–36). The Dunhuang and Hemis manuscripts do list the sūtra as the thirty-second
                            chapter of the Ratnakūṭa, as opposed to all other extant Kangyur editions. Also, the
                            Dunhuang Tibetan lists the work as a chapter (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">le’u</foreign>) rather than an “assembly” (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’dus pa</foreign>, Ch. <foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="term">hui</foreign>

                            Tibetan version of the sūtra was part of a collection that was not dependent on the Chinese
                            version of the Ratnakūṭa for its sequence and arrangement.</note>

                        householders. Other Indian Buddhist commentators such as Bhāviveka (ca. 500–570), Kamalaśīla
                        (ca. 740–95), and Atiśa (982–1054) cite the sūtra as a scriptural source for the immeasurable

                        householders suggests that there was considerable latitude as to what qualifies as the “word of

                        <term type="definition">The term <emph>dhāraṇī</emph>—in some sūtras a mnemonic formula and also the ability of realized beings to retain (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">√dhṛ</foreign>) in their transmundane memory any teachings—refers, in its most general use, to dhāraṇīs as understood in the context of the Dhāraṇī genre and Mahāyāna Buddhism. Such dhāraṇīs are divinely revealed prayer formulae that are dedicated to a particular deity and typically include homage, praise, supplication, exhortation to act, and, most importantly, the heart mantra or mantras of the deity. The specific meaning of “retention” is also present in this inasmuch as dhāraṇīs, once obtained, are never lost but stay with the person who obtained them. They function as doors (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇīdvāra</foreign>) or access points (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇīmukha</foreign>) to infinite qualities of buddhahood. When they are regarded to function as such, even shorter mantras can be designated as <emph>dhāraṇī</emph>.</term>
