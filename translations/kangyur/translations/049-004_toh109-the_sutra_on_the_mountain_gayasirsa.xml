                                                Buddha is dwelling with a large number of bhikṣus
                                                and bodhisattvas. Withdrawing into solitude, the
                                                Buddha reflects inwardly on the nature of his
                                                awakening, how it was attained, and the nature of
                                                the one who has attained it. After the Buddha
                                                answers the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī’s query about how

                                        <p tid="19">Vasubandhu’s commentary describes the general
                                                structure of the entire sūtra and provides lists of
                                                exegetical points to help organize its passages.
                                                According to Vasubandhu, the sūtra begins with (1)
                                                an introduction (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gleng gzhi</foreign>), which is
                                                followed by a description of (2) “the excellence of
                                                its harmonious audience” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mthun pa’i nyan pa po phun sum tshogs
                                                  pa</foreign>). This point in his list corresponds
                                                to the individual lines in the sūtra that describe
                                                the qualities of the one thousand bhikṣus in
                                                attendance. The sūtra then moves into its main
                                                topics, beginning with the Buddha’s withdrawal into
                                                solitude and engagement in contemplation. This is
                                                followed by the Buddha’s acknowledgement of his own
                                                awakening and his successful promulgation of the
                                                Dharma. Vasubandhu classifies these two sections as
                                                (3) meditative concentration (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ting nge
                                                  ’dzin</foreign>) and (4) “the purity of the
                                                realizer” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rtogs pa po rnam par dag pa</foreign>). In the
                                                sūtra, the Buddha examines the means by which
                                                awakening is realized, awakening itself, and the
                                                person who attains awakening. None of these
                                                examinations discovers any real entity associated
                                                with the different factors of awakening. Vasubandhu
                                                names this section (5) “matters to be examined”
                                                  (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">brtag par
                                                  bya ba’i dngos po</foreign>). These analyses,
                                                according to Vasubandhu, are conducted in meditative
                                                concentration; therefore, (6) “emergence from
                                                meditation” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bzhengs pa</foreign>) designates a transition
                                                between the completion of the Buddha’s meditative
                                                concentration and the commencement of his teaching.
                                                These distinctions are not, however, indicated in
                                                the text of the sūtra.</p>

                                                practices. The first part of the series begins with

                                                in the sūtra itself, but in the Mahāyāna sūtras and
                                                scholastic literature it is usually synonymous with
                                                the aspiration for complete awakening—in other

                                                rise to the mind of awakening are (1) the initial

                                                with conduct, (3) the giving rise to the mind of
                                                awakening that is irreversible, and (4) the giving

                                                the goal by one birth. <title xml:lang="en">Gayāśīrṣa Hill</title>, using various analogies
                                                and images, presents the four kinds of giving rise
                                                to the mind of awakening primarily as four different

                                                commentary under the last topic, (9) “the

                                                Mañjuśrī is approached by a deity who asks him to

                                                broad principles. In response, Mañjuśrī explains
                                                that method and wisdom are the two basic paths of
                                                bodhisattvas, and he elaborates how these two broad
                                                principles can be understood.</p>

                                        <p tid="24">In the last dialogue, Mañjuśrī responds to a
                                                bodhisattva’s questions, contrasting bodhisattvas’
                                                gnosis with the object of that gnosis, which is
                                                described as “dissociated.” Vasubandhu’s use of the
                                                term “very limit of reality” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtakoṭi</foreign>)
                                                and some additional synonyms given in the Chinese
                                                translation of the commentary indicate that
                                                “object,” in this context, refers to ultimate
                                                reality. This is supported by other terms in the
                                                sūtra associated with ultimate reality, such as
                                                “unconditioned” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">asaṃskṛta</foreign>). Gnosis, on the
                                                other hand, is characterized in the sūtra as
                                                “<term ref="UT22084-049-004-354">associated</term>”—that is, <term ref="UT22084-049-004-354">associated</term> with the mind.
                                                Mañjuśrī then presents six categories pertaining to
                                                bodhisattvas: (1) knowledge, (2) efforts, (3)
                                                applications, (4) investigations into inexhaustible
                                                subjects, (5) matters that relate to discipline, (6)
                                                and disciplined states. Each of these six items is
                                                divided into ten types. He concludes by advising
                                                bodhisattvas aspiring to awakening to focus on
                                                practice (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratipatti</foreign>), and he provides more

                                                practices.</p>

                                                consulted occasionally. However, it has been our
                                                principle not to use these sources to settle on a
                                                reading that cannot be derived from the Tibetan
                                                translation of the sūtra. We are aware that a
                                                complete textual history of this important sūtra,
                                                and a full account of the hermeneutics of its two
                                                extant Indian commentaries, cannot be adequately
                                                dealt with in the format of the present translation.
                                                Our hope is that this translation will inspire
                                                others to study this sūtra and its commentaries in

                                                at the shrine of Gayāśīrṣa on Gayā Hill together

                                                  which the sūtra’s phrases “without words,”
                                                  “without syllables,” and “without verbal
                                                  expression” mean “personally realized” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">so so rang gis rig

                                                  pa</foreign>), respectively. Second, he employs
                                                  ideas that are drawn from the Buddhist
                                                  epistemological tradition, which supports the
                                                  identification of the author of this sūtra
                                                  commentary with the Śākyabuddhi who wrote a

                                                  Edition, p. 964): “Conceptual construction is
                                                  called ‘word’ since it is the cause of verbal
                                                  expression. Because that [conceptual construction]
                                                  does not exist, it is said that it is without

                                                  superimposition of the aspect of a universal”

                                                  distinction between the two by giving the two
                                                  phrases separate senses: the former expression
                                                  means that awakening is not the object of
                                                  conceptualization, while the latter means that it
                                                  is not the object of speech (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">sgra med pa zhes

                                                  to</foreign>). Vasubandhu’s glosses of the two
                                                  sūtra phrases has guided Śākyabuddhi’s
                                                  interpretive choice. “Inexpressible” apparently
                                                  means not expressible by speech, while the
                                                  personal realization of the true nature by the
                                                  nondual wisdom is nonconceptual. For Śākyabuddhi,
