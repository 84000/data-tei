          Śākyamuni illustrates the power of generosity by narrating a distant past life as a
          magnanimous king named Kanakavarṇa, who ruled over the entire continent of Jambudvīpa.
          While faced with a devastating famine, this bodhisattva king decided to offer the last bit
          of food left in Jambudvīpa—which had been kept especially for him—to a pratyekabuddha who
          had come to his palace begging for alms. As a result of King Kanakavarṇa’s selfless gift,
          the whole continent was miraculously showered with all possible foods and goods, and the
          people of Jambudvīpa were saved. In addition to this immediate fruit of the king’s
          meritorious deed, a further fruit of the king’s good deed is implied when the Buddha
          discloses King Kanakavarṇa’s identity at the end of the story. The king’s generosity would
          reach full karmic fruition in his perfect awakening in a future life as the Buddha
          Śākyamuni. </p>

          <p tid="9">As a discourse in which the Buddha narrates one of his past lives, <title xml:lang="en">The Past Endeavor of Kanakavarṇa</title> can be placed in the same class
            of teachings as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātakas</foreign>, “birth
            stories,” and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadānas</foreign>, “exemplary
            tales.” In this type of teaching, the Buddha explains his present awakened state or the
            present conditions of others, whether fortunate or unfortunate, by narrating the
            past-life actions that led to these conditions, thus showing the workings of karma and
            the inevitable results of meritorious or unmeritorious deeds. Usually, texts of this
            kind begin with an extensive narrative section that is set in the present. This
            describes the situation or the individual’s circumstance that the text will then explain
            by means of a past-life story. However, this is not the case for <title xml:lang="en">The Past Endeavor of Kanakavarṇa</title>, which, as will be seen, consists almost
            entirely of a past-life story of the Buddha, narrated without preamble. Therefore, it
            was classified as a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign>, an
            account of a “past endeavor,” at least according to the title as given in the Tibetan
              translation.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-68"> The title of the extant
                Sanskrit text in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Divyāvadāna</title> is <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kanaka­varṇāvadāna</title>, which places it in the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna </foreign>category. However, this designation
              is likely to have happened when the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Divyāvadāna</title>, the
              collection of texts in which it has been preserved, was compiled. At this time, the
              different individual texts, whether strictly belonging to the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātaka</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> genres or not, were all given the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> designation. Historically, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> genres, which involve the past lives of other
              figures apart from the Buddha, appear to be posterior to the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātakas</foreign>, which exclusively narrate the
              Buddha Śākyamuni’s past lives. This development might be suggested by the fact that
              the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> genre is among the three
              added categories in the Sanskrit list of twelve types of teaching (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dvādaśāṅga</foreign>) that are not found in the Pali
              list of nine types of teachings (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">navaṅga</foreign>), which, however, does include <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātaka</foreign> as a category. Both the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> genres seem to have been especially popular in the northwest of
              the Indian subcontinent, as can be inferred from the relatively large number of texts
              of this type among the recently discovered Kharoṣṭhī manuscripts in the Gāndhārī
              language (see Lenz 2003; 2010). In fact, the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> might have its provenance there, as has been
              suggested by von Hinüber (2001, p. 520) on the basis of the occurrence of the term in
              the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Milindapañha</title>, a Pali text that has its origin in
              Gandhāra. At the beginning of the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Milindapañha</title>,
              before the narration of the past lives of its two protagonists, Nāgasena and King
              Milinda, we also find a short definition of the term: “<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">pubbayoga</foreign> means their past actions”
                (<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="quote">pubbayogo ti tesāṃ pubbakammaṃ</foreign>;
              Mil 2.23). Interestingly, within the surviving Gāndhārī corpus of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadānas</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayogas</foreign>, which has been dated to approximately the first
              half of the first century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, a strict distinction is
              maintained in designating the two kinds of texts: while the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> is an account of someone’s actions in a previous
              lifetime, the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> is always an
              account of actions performed in the present lifetime (Lenz 2003, p. 92). From this it
              would appear that the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> form
              that includes past-life stories, as found in such collections as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Avadānaśataka</title> and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Divyāvadāna</title>, arose only in later centuries, during which the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> genre came to encompass both
                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātaka</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> stories.</note> There are no other
            standalone texts designated as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign> in the Kangyur, but the genre is represented in individual
            chapters of Mahāyāna sūtras such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saddharma­puṇḍarīka
              Sūtra</title> and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Samādhi­rāja Sūtra</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-69"> See <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of

          <p tid="10">The setting of this particular discourse is Jetavana, the grove outside
            Śrāvastī that had been gifted to the Buddha and the monastic saṅgha by a wealthy lay
            devotee called Anāthapiṇḍada. There, in the presence of an assembly of 1,250 monks, the
            Buddha begins his teaching by making a twofold statement on the virtue of generosity.
            First, he states that if beings were to know what he knows of the karmic results of
            generosity, they would always share whatever they have, even if, as it is tellingly put,
            it is their last bit of food. However, as the Buddha then points out, beings are often
            ignorant of the merit that comes from an act of generosity and tend to be guided by
            selfishness. This twofold proclamation by the Buddha is also found as a separate
            discourse, preserved in Pali as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Dānasaṃ­vibhāga
              Sutta</title>

              Braarvig 2014, p.163. </note> In the present text, the Buddha further illustrates
            these statements with a story of one of his past lives, thus demonstrating his
            first-hand knowledge of the immense power of generosity.</p>

          <p tid="11">The story is that of a king named Kanakavarṇa, who, we are told, lived in a
            remote past when people still had life spans of eighty-four thousand years. This king is
            described as possessing all possible worldly attainments: he had a “golden-colored” (the
            literal meaning of his name) bodily complexion, abundant riches, and a vast and thriving
            empire stretching across the whole of Jambudvīpa. More impressive, however, was his
            righteous and generous nature. The Buddha states that he governed his people
            unselfishly, engaging in all possible forms of charity. The king’s generosity was such
            that one day—and it was from this that the events narrated begin to unfold—he decided to
            abolish all taxes and levies for the people of Jambudvīpa. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-74"/>
          <p tid="12">However, King Kanakavarṇa did not foresee that, after many years of prosperity
            and just governance for his people, the astrological conditions would become
            unfavorable. When the brahmins at the court noticed this adverse shift in the
            constellations and celestial bodies, they informed the king that there would be no rain
            for the next twelve years. Aware of the impending disaster this portended for his
            people, especially for the poor who were without the means to survive a drought of such
            length, the king immediately went into action. He issued the order that all available
            foodstuffs were to be collected and placed in a single storehouse, and from there they
            were to be distributed equally among the people of Jambudvīpa. For eleven years, this
            strategy was successful and famine was averted, but then in the twelfth year the food
            started to run out and people began to die of starvation. The situation became ever more
            dire in the course of the following eleven months, to the point that there was only a
            single portion of food left in the storehouse, which had been reserved for King
            Kanakavarṇa himself. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-75"/>
          <p tid="13">The narrative here shifts to the key protagonist in the momentous event that
            is about to take place. The Buddha describes how in that particular period there was a
            bodhisattva—left unnamed—who had been on the bodhisattva path for forty eons, but who,
            after witnessing a particularly heinous act, had abandoned his aim of reaching perfect
            buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. Applying himself instead to his own
            liberation from saṃsāra, this person, within a short span of time, had gained complete
            insight into the impermanent nature of phenomena and thereby attained the awakening of a
            pratyekabuddha, a “solitary awakened one.” In Buddhist traditions, a pratyekabuddha is
            someone who has attained complete liberation from saṃsāra without the guidance of a
            teacher. However, such liberation is distinguished from that of a perfectly awakened
            buddha like the Buddha Śākyamuni, since they are not able to verbally teach the path to
            liberation to others. This typology of buddhas who reach individual awakening arose
            early on in Buddhist tradition and was particularly associated with an early text known
            as the <title xml:lang="en">Rhinoceros Sūtra</title> (Pali: <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Khaggavisāṇa Sutta</title>) in which the practitioner is exhorted to “move alone like
            a rhinoceros.” <note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-76"> This phrase has given rise
              to considerable discussion in modern scholarship, since the compound word that is used
              in Sanskrit and Pali, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">khaḍgaviṣāṇa</foreign>
              and <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">khaggavisāṇa</foreign>, can be interpreted
              in more than one way. The word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">khaḍga</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">khagga</foreign>
              itself can mean “rhinoceros,” and since <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">viṣāṇa</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">visāṇa</foreign>
              means “horn,” the compound can be taken as “the horn of a rhinoceros,” which is the
              interpretation followed in the Pali commentarial tradition. In this interpretation,
              the entire phrase is understood as “move alone like a rhinoceros horn,” in reference
              to the fact that the Indian rhinoceros has a single horn, distinguishing it from
              animals that have two horns. On the other hand, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">khaḍga</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">khagga</foreign>
              also has the meaning “sword,” and together with <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">viṣāṇa</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">visāṇa</foreign>, “horn,” the entire compound <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">khaḍgaviṣāṇa</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">khaggavisāṇa</foreign> can mean “[the animal which has] a sword-horn,” thus
              referring to the rhinoceros itself. In this understanding, which is mostly seen in
              Buddhist Sanskrit literature, the phrase “move alone like a rhinoceros” alludes to the
              solitary behavior of the Indian rhinoceros, which is known not to roam about in
              groups. It should be kept in mind, however, that both meanings could be intended at
              the same time in this particular phrase, as has been pointed out by Salomon (2000, p.
              13; 2018, p. xx). For a recent discussion of this issue, see Jones 2014, and for a
              wider survey on the imagery of the wandering ascetic as a rhinoceros in Brahmanical,
              Jain, and Buddhist literature, see af Edholm 2021.</note> At some point during the
            early period, the individual verses that make up the <title xml:lang="en">Rhinoceros
              Sūtra</title> came to be credited as the utterances of pratyekabuddhas of past
              times.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-77"> The first texts in which these
              verses are attributed to pratyekabuddhas are the Pali <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Cullaniddesa</title>, an old commentary on the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Suttanipāta</title>, and the Pali <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Apadāna</title>, a
              collection of autobiographical poems ascribed to the Buddha Śākyamuni, the
              pratyekabuddhas of the past, and the foremost arhat disciples of the Buddha. Both
              texts are old enough to have been included in the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Khuddakanikāya</title> of the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Suttapiṭaka</title> of the
              Pali canon; the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Apadāna</title> was probably compiled around
              the second century <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi> (Walters 1997), which is perhaps
              also the time period of the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Cullaniddesa</title> (von Hinüber
              1996, p. 58, §118, and p. 61, §121). In both texts, the verses are simply ascribed to
              pratyekabuddhas collectively, without narrating the specific occasion of each verse.
              This is also the case for the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvastu</title>, the
              voluminous Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda compilation on the life of the Buddha (parts of
              which have also been dated to the second century <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi>), in
              which several adapted verses from the <title xml:lang="en">Rhinoceros Sūtra</title>
              are presented as having been uttered by a group of five hundred pratyekabuddhas living
              in a forest near Vārāṇasī—the site of the future Deer Park—just before the birth of
              the Buddha Śākyamuni in this world (Mvu I 357–359). Upon hearing of the coming of the
              Buddha to this buddhafield and the necessity for them to vacate, each of these
              pratyekabuddhas is said to have proclaimed such a verse before passing into
              parinirvāṇa by rising into the sky and incinerating themselves, after which their
              bodily remnants fell to the ground. This is then said to explain the other name for
              the site of the Buddha’s first teaching, the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ṛṣipatana</foreign>, which literally means “the falling of sages.” For a
              useful discussion of the different versions and a translation of the Gāndhārī verses
              of the <title xml:lang="en">Rhinoceros Sūtra</title>, see Salomon 2018.</note> The
            verse proclaimed by the pratyekabuddha upon his awakening in <title xml:lang="en">The
              Past Endeavor of Kanakavarṇa</title> (at folio 53.a) is an example of such a verse,
            which has direct parallels with the second verse of both the Pali <title xml:lang="en">Rhinoceros Sūtra</title> as well as the recently discovered Gāndhārī Sanskrit
            version. In this extant Sanskrit of the story of King Kanakavarṇa, the verse reads as

            solitary way of life in view of the dangers of being in close company with others, they
            also emphasize the need to cultivate loving-kindness and compassion.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-111"> This is stated in one of the concluding verses of <title xml:lang="en">The Rhinoceros Sutta</title> in both the Pali (Sn v. 73) and the
              Gāndhārī (v. 36), but it is also expressed at the beginning of the Gāndhārī version
              and the Sanskrit verses in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvastu</title>, in which
              the second half of the first verse reads: <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">maitreṇa cittena hitānukaṃpī eko care khaḍga­viṣāṇa­kalpo</foreign>, “With a mind of
              loving-kindness, being compassionate for the welfare [of others], one should move
              alone like a rhinoceros.”</note> This quality is also given expression in the freshly
            awakened pratyekabuddha in <title xml:lang="en">The Past Endeavor of
            Kanakavarṇa</title>. The Buddha describes how, after attaining “individual awakening,” the
            pratyekabuddha compassionately thought of benefitting other beings by receiving alms
            from them, thereby giving them the opportunity to gather merit. Being the only awakened
            being in the world at that time, albeit lower in rank to a perfectly awakened buddha,
            the pratyekabuddha would have been the most “worthy of offerings” and the most fruitful
            “field of merit,” as it is traditionally put, in terms of yielding karmic benefit. As
            the pratyekabuddha scanned the whole world through his newly acquired supernormal
            abilities, he discovered that there was only one portion of food left—the one reserved
            for the king. Therefore, he decided to extend his compassion to King Kanakavarṇa by
            seeking alms from him. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-076-004-112"/>
          <p tid="42">It is this alms round and its miraculous outcome that forms the centerpiece of
            the story. This crucial moment—when the pratyekabuddha becomes the recipient of King
            Kanakavarṇa’s ultimate act of generosity—brings to the fore the prime qualities of the
            two central actors: the bodhisattva king who accompanies his act of self-sacrifice with
            the deep wish that it bring an end to the destitution and suffering of his people, and
            the solitary buddha who teaches the Dharma “bodily, not verbally,” as he silently leaves
            in the same miraculous way as he had come, after having provided the king with the
            opportunity to generate immense merit. The “root of virtue” that King Kanakavarṇa has
            planted through this relinquishment of self-interest is such that, right after the
            pratyekabuddha has received his meal and departed, it immediately ripens into the
            fulfillment of the king’s wish, as narrated in the wondrous culmination of the story.
            Moreover, and more importantly still, when the Buddha reveals at the end of the story
            that he himself was King Kanakavarṇa at that time, it is implied that the merit of this
            “past endeavor” occasioned by the compassionate pratyekabuddha would eventually come to
            full ripening in the attainment of perfect and full awakening by the Buddha Śākyamuni in
            his present lifetime. Having thus illustrated the karmic potency of such an act of
            generosity, the Buddha concludes by repeating the twofold statement on the virtue of
            generosity that he had pronounced at the beginning of the discourse, followed by a verse
            on the imperishability of good karma. </p>

          <p tid="43">This story about King Kanakavarṇa’s feat has been preserved in several
            different versions and retellings. The earliest of these is found in a collection of the
            Buddha’s past life stories that was translated into Chinese in the fourth or early fifth
            century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, entitled <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Pu sa ben xing

                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pūrvayoga</foreign>.</note> In this version,
            the story does not have a prelude containing a twofold statement on generosity. Instead,
            it is narrated by the Buddha upon the passing away of a miserly wealthy man from
            Śrāvastī named Mahānāman. When King Prasenajit comes to the Buddha to ask him where
            Mahānāman has been reborn, the Buddha tells him that the miserly Mahānāman has fallen
            into hell. Here he will be subject to great suffering for thousands of years, after
            which he will also have to endure rebirth as a hungry ghost for a long duration. In
            response to King Prasenajit’s distress upon hearing this, the Buddha states that a wise
            person should abandon miserliness and engage in generosity. It is by virtue of this that
            one obtains good fortune in the present life and merit for future lives, and the Buddha
            then narrates his past life as King Kanakavarṇa as an illustration. While in general the
            story told is the same as that found in <title xml:lang="en">The Past Endeavor of
              Kanakavarṇa</title>, there are several differences, the most notable being that the
            person who becomes the pratyekabuddha is not first described as being a bodhisattva, nor
            is there the verse from <title xml:lang="en">The Rhinoceros Sūtra</title> that he

                                <p>One of the twelve genres or types of teaching (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dvādaśāṅga</foreign>) given by the Buddha. The
                  Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign> means
                  “exceptional feat” or “illustrious deed.” However, in the context of the twelve
                  types of teachings, it came to refer to the narrative accounts of such deeds. In

                  Asaṅga defines the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign>
                  as “that which is illustrated with an example, an example by which the relevant

                                <p>A common measure of distance in ancient India. It refers to
                the distance that an ox cart can traverse in one day, that is, in one “harnessing”
                    (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yojana</foreign>), i.e., before unyoking
                  the oxen. Each region seems to have had its own estimate of this distance. In the
                  eastern region of Magadha, a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yojana</foreign> consisted of four <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">krośas</foreign>, thus equalling about 4.5 miles or 7.4 kilometers. In
                  Vasubandhu’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharmakośa</title> (III 88), on the
                  other hand, a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yojana</foreign> is defined
                  as consisting of eight <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">krośas</foreign>,
                  which indicates that in the northwestern region of Gandhāra it referred to a
                  distance twice as long as in Magadha.</p>
