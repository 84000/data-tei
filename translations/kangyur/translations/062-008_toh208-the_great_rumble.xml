                                        Śrāvastī when he notices an immaculate palace. He wonders
                                        whether it would be more meritorious to offer such a palace
                                        to the monastic community or to enshrine a relic of the
                                        Buddha within a small stūpa. He poses this question to the
                                        Buddha who describes how the merit of the latter far exceeds
                                        any other offerings one could make. The reason the Buddha
                                        cites for this is the immense qualities that the buddhas
                                        possess.</p>

                                                a short Mahāyāna sūtra that details the benefits to
                                                be derived from the construction and worship of
                                                stūpas and statues of the buddhas. The sūtra begins
                                                in Śrāvastī where Ānanda is on an alms round and
                                                notices an immaculate palace. He wonders whether it
                                                would be more meritorious to offer such an enormous
                                                palace to the monastic community or to enshrine
                                                buddha relics within tiny stūpas and create
                                                miniature statues of the buddha. He poses this
                                                question to the Buddha, who responds that the latter
                                                would be of greater merit due to the immeasurable
                                                qualities of the buddhas. The Buddha’s answer
                                                asserts the superiority of buddhas over stream
                                                enterers, once-returners, non-returners, and
                                                arhats—the four results of the śrāvaka path. It also
                                                emphasizes the benefits to be gained generally from
                                                the creation and worship of stūpas.</p>

                                        <p tid="11">In his reply, the Buddha proposes scenarios in
                                                which greater and greater gifts to the saṅgha can be
                                                made, yet the answer remains the same—enshrining
                                                relics in stūpas or creating statues of the buddhas
                                                will always be more meritorious. The repetitiveness
                                                here is characteristic of the sūtra literature which
                                                has its origins in the oral tradition. When the
                                                sūtras were committed to writing, the South Asian
                                                scribes deliberately omitted repetitive material and
                                                marked elided sections with the phrase <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">iti yāvad . . . iti
                                                  peyālam</foreign>, a scribal insertion indicating
                                                passages that have already been given in full
                                                previously in the text, and which are understood to
                                                be repeated in full each time the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">iti
                                                  peyālam</foreign> was inserted. This technique
                                                served as a means for conserving scribal resources
                                                such as palm leaves, ink, and other media. In the
                                                Tibetan translation, the elided section is marked
                                                with the first and last words of the passage, framed
                                                with the phrases <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">ces/zhes bya nas . . . ces/zhes bya

                                                this English translation, where such passages have
                                                been marked with ellipses.</p>

                                                sūtra serves to express the inexpressible qualities
                                                of the buddhas and to calculate the incalculable
                                                amount of merit gained from venerating them. This
                                                hypothetical abstraction is made concrete when the
                                                Buddha tells the story of Ajātaśatru, who became the
                                                king of Magadha by murdering his father, the king
                                                Bimbisāra. He was also involved in creating a schism
                                                in the saṅgha and plotting to kill the Buddha with
                                                Devadatta, the Buddha’s cousin, who is depicted in
                                                Buddhist literature as envious of the Buddha and his
                                                teachings. Though Ajātaśatru later reformed to
                                                become a devout disciple of the Buddha, this sūtra
                                                notes that he was to be briefly reborn in the hells,
                                                since patricide is one of the five misdeeds of
                                                immediate retribution. Ajātaśatru was nevertheless
                                                freed from this state, and he was prophesied by the
                                                Buddha to become a pratyekabuddha by the name of
                                                Vijayasena. Again, the sūtra implies that
                                                Ajātaśatru’s worshiping of the Buddha and his
                                                immeasurable qualities in the form of relics lessens
                                                his otherwise weighty negative karma.</p>

                                                can thus be dated roughly to the early ninth

                                                compiled. The colophon notes that the sūtra was
                                                initially translated by the Tibetan monk Gewa Pal

                                                  them, Mahāmaudgalyāyana divided the relics into

                                                and prevent him from regressing to lower rebirth for
                                                the next twenty eons. He will then shave his head

                                                  sorrow, denotes the ultimate attainment of
                                                  buddhahood, the permanent cessation of all
                                                  suffering and the afflicted mental states that
                                                  cause and perpetuate suffering, along with all
                                                  misapprehension with regard to the nature of
                                                  emptiness. As such, it is the antithesis of cyclic
                                                  existence. Three types of nirvāṇa are identified:
                                                  (1) the residual nirvāṇa where the person is still
                                                  dependent on conditioned psycho-physical
                                                  aggregates, (2) the non-residual nirvāṇa where the
                                                  aggregates have also been consumed within
                                                  emptiness, and (3) the non-abiding nirvāṇa
                                                  transcending the extremes of phenomenal existence
                                                  and quiescence. Final nirvāṇa implies the
                                                  non-residual attainment.</term>
