                                        the region of Pañcāla, where King Brahmadatta requests Amoghadarśin to impart teachings to him and his citizens. The
                                        bodhisattva discusses the attributes and correct practices of a king who is a protector of the Dharma. The king requests
                                        that the bodhisattva remain in his kingdom to observe the summer vows in retreat. Sixty wicked monks already residing
                                        there treat Amoghadarśin poorly, and after three months he leaves Pañcāla and returns to the Jeta Grove.</p>

                                        consequences of such actions. The Buddha then goes on to explain what a monk and others who wish to attain awakening
                                        should strive for, namely, to rid themselves of pride, anger, and jealousy. Upon hearing these instructions, King
                                        Brahmadatta expels the sixty wicked monks from his kingdom. Many beings then generate the mind of awakening, and King
                                        Brahmadatta is irreversibly set on the path of complete awakening. The Buddha smiles and radiates multicolored lights
                                        throughout the whole world. Finally, the king apologizes to Amoghadarśin and the bodhisattva forgives him.</p>

                                                on the path to awakening. These five qualities are (1) possessing faith, (2) longing for the Dharma, (3)
                                                believing in the Dharma’s profundity, (4) fully upholding the teachings, and (5) making an effort to completely
                                                uphold the supreme Dharma. Amoghadarśin goes on to clarify in verse a king’s essential role as a protector of
                                                the Dharma. The king expresses humility by replying that he has all the shortcomings and none of the good
                                                qualities mentioned, confessing that he has harmed and killed others. The king and his subjects then vow to
                                                generate the mind of awakening by following the bodhisattva path, and they ask the bodhisattva to remain in

                                                material needs. However, sixty degenerate monks are already residing there. They possess negative attributes
                                                such as jealousy, pride, and resentment and do not follow the rules of the Vinaya, the Buddhist monastic code.
                                                Since they do not like the presence of Amoghadarśin and his monks, they make rude remarks and spread rumors
                                                about Amoghadarśin. Additionally, a minister of King Brahmadatta causes a rift between Amoghadarśin and the
                                                wicked monks and between the bodhisattva and King Brahmadatta. Although there is only brief mention of the

                                                stating that the monks “spread such remarks by visiting the homes of brahmins and householders with little

                                                King Brahmadatta, hearing that Amoghadarśin had gone to the Buddha because the sixty degenerate monks had
                                                mistreated him, goes to see the Buddha. He tells the Buddha that he feels the bodhisattva had left too soon,
                                                whereupon the Buddha explains how the monks there had behaved. The Buddha then describes the causes for lacking
                                                effort, the characteristics of jealous people, and how to recognize those who have strayed from the path to
                                                awakening. The Buddha explains how to recognize degenerate monks and how other ordained individuals should treat
                                                such monks. He warns that the consequences of the increased number of wicked monks—that is, monks who do not
                                                follow the Vinaya correctly and do not have faith in the Dharma—could lead to the destruction of the Dharma.
                                                Throughout this sūtra, the Buddha encourages monks and those who wish to attain awakening to refrain from such
                                                negative behavior; he also alludes to a king’s responsibility to expel degenerate monks for the sake of the
                                                Dharma and the future lives of his own subjects. In accord with this advice, King Brahmadatta expels the sixty
                                                degenerate monks from his kingdom, and by doing so he becomes irreversibly set on the path to awakening.
                                                Finally, King Brahmadatta apologizes to Amoghadarśin and is forgiven. </p>
