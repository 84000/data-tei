                    delivered by the Buddha Śākyamuni to a host of bodhisattvas from faraway worlds as
                    well as a selection of his closest hearer students, such as Śāradvatī­putra and
                    Ānanda, elucidates in particular the practice of engendering and strengthening
                    the mind of awakening, as well as the practice of bodhisattva conduct for the
                    sake of all other beings.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">Upholding the Roots of Virtue</title> is one of
                        the most extensive sūtras in the Tibetan Kangyur, spanning no fewer than 452
                        Tibetan pages. Apart from a brief summary of the text by Csoma de Körös in
                        1836,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-048-001-4" index="1"> Csoma
                            de Körös 1836, p. 429. His summary of the sūtra was later published in
                            French translation by Henri Léon Feer (1881). </note>  
                        the sūtra has never, to our knowledge, received sustained scholarly
                            attention. While the Sanskrit
                        source text appears to have disappeared, we do have translations of this
                        sūtra into Chinese and Tibetan. The Chinese translation, <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Fo shuo hua shou jing</title>
                        <title xml:lang="zh">佛說華手經</title> (Taishō 657), was produced by the renowned
                        translator Kumārajīva (344–413 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>), who completed
                        the translation toward the end of his life in 406, while residing in the
                        former Chinese capital of Chang’an. The Tibetan translation was produced
                        approximately four centuries later. This might suggest that the sūtra
                        enjoyed some popularity in Indian Buddhist circles during the heyday of
                        Great Vehicle thought and practice. Unfortunately, however, we have not been
                        able to locate any citations from this sūtra in the commentarial works of
                        Indian scholars. Complicating matters further, although the Chinese
                        translation generally corresponds fairly closely with the Tibetan, the
                        Chinese is divided into thirty-five chapters, but the Tibetan
                        into only fifteen. Much remains to be explored, therefore, concerning the 
                        history of this sūtra’s formation and transmission. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-048-001-5"/>
                    <p tid="8">The Tibetan translation was produced by
                        translators who flourished during the late eighth and early ninth centuries
                        when the majority of Indian Great Vehicle sūtras were translated into
                            Tibetan.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-048-001-6" index="2"> The
                            dating of the Tibetan translation to the late eight to early ninth
                            century is also attested by the text’s inclusion in the early ninth
                            century Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>)
                            catalog, dated to c. 812 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, which lists it
                                among the “Miscellaneous Sūtras” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sde sna tshogs</foreign>) 
                                between eleven and twenty-six sections (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bam 
                                    po</foreign>) long. Denkarma, F.296.b.6; see also Herrmann-Pfandt 2008, p. 43, no.
                            76.</note> The main translator of this sūtra was a relatively unknown
                        person by the name of Leki Dé who, as was customary with such translations, was
                        assisted in his task by an Indian scholar, the renowned Indian preceptor
                        Prajñāvarman. The translation was later revised and finalized by
                        Prajñāvarman and another influential Indian paṇḍita, Jñānagarbha, as well as
                        the prolific translator and chief editor Yeshé Dé. While the more than one
                        hundred Kangyur translations to which Yeshé Dé is said to have contributed
                        are generally of very high quality, in working on this sūtra we found that
                        certain sections of the Tibetan translation lacked the clarity and precision
                        that otherwise characterize translations that acknowledge Yeshé Dé’s
                        editorial involvement. We have recorded these passages in the notes, with the
                        hope that scholars might take up the task of comparing them closely with
                        other Tibetan versions and Kumārajīva’s Chinese translation. In producing
                        this English translation, we have based our work on the Degé xylograph
                        Kangyur, in consultation with the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dpe 
                            bsdur ma</foreign>) Kangyur and, in
                        the case of several particularly difficult terms and passages, comparison
                        with the Stok Palace manuscript Kangyur and Kumārajīva’s Chinese translation. </p>

                    <p tid="9">The content of the sūtra is structured into fifteen chapters in which
                        the Buddha Śākyamuni teaches a gathering of bodhisattvas from other worlds as
                        well as a small selection of his closest hearer students, such as
                        Śāradvatī­putra and Ānanda, a variety of topics roughly centered on how
                        to arouse, sustain, and practice the mind of awakening. The topic of
                        “upholding the roots of virtue” is treated in this Great Vehicle context. A

                        boy, enters the assembly and requests the Buddha Śākyamuni for permission to
                        take ordination. The Buddha responds with a profound teaching on the
                        criteria for and nature of ordination, focusing on the mind of awakening as
                        the ultimate benchmark. Śāradvatī­putra, now curious as to the
                        qualifications of the young boy, asks the Buddha a series of questions about
                        him. The Buddha reports that Vijayarakṣa had already been an adept for
                        several preceding eons. This prompts Śāradvatī­putra to question Vijayarakṣa
                        about ordination. Vijayarakṣa responds with a teaching on the ultimate
                        nature of ordination and then vanishes. Śāradvatī­putra’s subsequent
                        astonishment forms the pretext for the Buddha to give a discourse on the
                        qualifications, identity, observance, and benefits of a bodhisattva’s
                        genuine ordination. The chapter concludes with the Buddha recounting the story
                        of a prince’s renunciation of his kingdom, and his eventual ordination. </p>

                        mentally when pursuing, receiving, and teaching the Dharma. The Buddha
                        relates a story to illustrate how this kind of conduct with respect to
                        Dharma results in being part of a pure Dharma retinue. The chapter concludes
                        with the Buddha elaborating upon the sublime characteristics of a pure

                        now offer their shawls to the Buddha Śākyamuni to request that Dharma discourses
                        might continue to be given in the future. After a number of miraculous
                        displays are witnessed emerging from the shawls, Ānanda expresses his
                        amazement. The Buddha responds by asking him to relate what he saw, and
                        Ānanda follows suit with an elaborate description followed by questions.
                        However, before the Buddha responds to Ānanda’s inquiries, he asks Ānanda to
                        wait for the bodhisattva Dṛḍhamati to ask his questions. Dṛḍhamati then
                        inquires about how beings “enter the gate” of the Dharma before launching
                        into a series of questions concerning the entire bodhisattva path that all
                        center upon whether and how teachers will bestow Dharma teachings in the
                        future. The Buddha recounts how in a previous lifetime Dṛḍhamati had asked
                        other buddhas those same questions. He then proceeds to teach on the
                        gateways of Dharma, the nature of language, the nature of phenomena, and the
                        meditative absorptions by which Dharma preachers acquire insight and
                        eloquence. The chapter ends with the Buddha reassuring Dṛḍhamati that in the
                        future there will be no shortage of beings who will acquire, through meditative
                        absorption, the linguistic gateways into the Dharma and the requisite

                        to the water were four steps, each of them made of precious substances:
                        gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. Sand of gold was strewn, and in the ponds
                        blossomed blue, pink, red, and white lotuses. In the sky above, he emanated
                        a latticed canopy made of the seven precious substances. The courtyard was
                        decorated with numerous silken tassels, the air was filled with pleasant
                        wafts of incense, and there were beds of various flowers, each the size

                        right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said,
                        “Blessed One, with this gateway of the Dharma I have discovered something

                        provides all those beings with enjoyable things. He is able to lift them up
                        and hold them by his hand for an eon or more, faithfully providing them with
                        whatever forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures they might wish for.
                        Meanwhile, he uses his other hand to collect all the feces and urine of all

                        that? Because he does not want any of them to experience any unpleasant
                        odor. Dṛḍhamati, what do you think? Does that man render proper service to

                        could not even be contained within all those universes. It would be even
                        larger. Dṛḍhamati, the thus-gone ones, the worthy ones, the perfect buddhas
                        know all these heaps of merit completely. Such merits are beyond measure,
                        innumerable, limitless, ineffable, and beyond count, and yet the thus-gone
                        one knows them completely. Dṛḍhamati, I am not aware of any number of
                        syllables, or any number of letters, or any number of digits that can convey
                        the knowledge of such heaps of merit. In the end there would be nothing but

                        of awakening depends on the initial engendering of that mind. Ajita, the
                        reason there are so few thus-gone ones is that bodhisattvas are so rare.
                        Ajita, consider this analogy. If there were no butter there would no longer
                        be any clarified butter. Likewise, Ajita, if the mind is not set on
                        awakening one will never become a thus-gone one. Ajita, consider this
                        analogy. When there is butter there is also an uninterrupted supply of
                        clarified butter. Similarly, Ajita, <ref cRef="F.51.a" type="folio"/> when
                        there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thus-gone ones.
                        Ajita, consider this analogy. When there is a seed there can also be a
                        sprout. Likewise, Ajita, if there are bodhisattvas in the world there will
                        also be thus-gone ones. Ajita, the reason thus-gone ones are so rare is
                        therefore precisely because bodhisattvas are rare.</p>

                    <p tid="363">“Ajita, consider this analogy. Compared to the priceless jewels in
                        the ocean, there is a greater number of valuable jewels in general.
                        Similarly, among sentient beings there are only a few who abide by the mind
                        of awakening. In comparison, those who keep the mindset of a hearer or a
                        solitary buddha are so many. </p>

                        rare. They are extremely rare. Being so extremely rare, they are like the
                        uḍumbara flower. Those who engender the mind of awakening are priceless,
                        like priceless jewels. Those who engender the mind of awakening are greatly

                        beings—gods and others. Therefore, Ajita, persist in the practice of
                        engendering the awakened mind. Do so joyfully, forcefully, clearly, <ref cRef="F.51.b" type="folio"/> boldly, and with commitment.</p>

                    <p tid="366">“Ajita, you may then wonder what it means to engender the mind of
                        awakening. Arousing the mind of awakening is not something that can be counted
                        or measured. Nevertheless, Ajita, for the sake of comprehension I shall give
                        you just an illustration, just a single example. Long ago in the past, before limitless
                        and innumerable eons, there was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect
                        buddha, someone wise and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, a
                        steersman taming beings, an unsurpassable one, a teacher of gods and humans,
                        a blessed buddha by the name of King of Bliss. Ajita, the lifespan of that
                        blessed one was eighty-four thousand years. Ajita, the first assembly of
                        that blessed one’s hearers numbered seven hundred sixty million. The second
                        assembly contained nine hundred sixty million, and the third one billion
                        hearers. Without exception, they were all foe-destroyers who had brought an
                        end to defilement, completed their task, completed their work, laid down the
                        load, achieved their own objectives, exhausted the bonds to existence, and
                        achieved liberation through the mind of equality. At that time there was a
                        royal palace known as Immense Vista, and within that palace resided a king of
                        royal descent who had received anointment. He was known by the name of Lion
                        Glory, and his eminent queen gave birth to two twin boys, one named <term ref="UT22084-048-001-3951">Aśoka</term>

                        this is how it is. The more constructs, the more awakening. Why? Because all
                        constructs are void, and so is awakening. What then is voidness? Voidness is
                        a construct. And what are constructs? They are thought. That is to say,
                        there are the constructs of form, feeling, perception, formation, and
                        consciousness; the constructs of discipline and absorption; the constructs
                        of few desires and contentment; and the constructs of being easily satisfied
                        and being distinct. Where do constructs come from? They come from thinking,
                        that is to say, from the thought of form to the thought of absorption—each
                        thought is construction. Whatever is thought has no form, and thus thinking
                        is not something with form. That which is thought is absence of thought.
                        That which is thought is neither discipline nor anything else, up to and
                        including contentment. And awakening is the emptiness of form. Awakening is
                        the emptiness of feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. So also
                        with discipline, absorption, few desires, contentment, being easily
                        satisfied, and being easily nourished—all are emptiness. And emptiness is
                        neither sameness nor difference. That, precisely, is what awakening is.’

                        anything that can be gleaned, understood, or mastered, such that they can be
                        expressed, glossed, assigned, put forth, followed, analyzed, investigated,
                        dissected, and pursued. They are the Dharma to be pursued, any Dharma, and
                        all the Dharma and signs included in them, which can be considered, pondered
                        on, and mentally expressed, as well as any Dharma, for that matter, that can
                        be an object of doubt, hesitation, regret, engagement, or certainty. Now,
                        Śāradvatī­putra, what is <distinct>meaning</distinct>? It is the
                        comprehended significance of the words. Śāradvatī­putra, ‘meaning’ is
                        inexpressible. What is it, Śāradvatī­putra, that the immature grasp in terms
                        of meaning? Well, it is the words, <emph>not</emph> the meaning. It is in
                        this way, Śāradvatī­putra, that meaning is inexpressible. Śāradvatī­putra, I
                        do not speak in conformity with the world. Thus I taught the statement, ‘The
                        world speaks in conformity with me,’ with an indirect intention in mind.
                        Śāradvatī­putra, the expertise that was taught by the Thus-Gone One was not
                        taught by him at all. <ref cRef="F.120.b" type="folio"/> Therefore, the
                        Thus-Gone One is, in this way, an expert in the aggregates, the elements,
                        and the sense sources. Since there is no expertise in them at all, the
                        Thus-Gone One has taught expertise in such things. </p>

                            <distinct>phenomena</distinct> and what is its examination?
                        Śāradvatī­putra, the eyes are said to be phenomena, as are the ears, nose,
                        tongue, body, and mind. So how, Śāradvatī­putra, are the eyes phenomena?
                        Śāradvatī­putra, <distinct>eyes</distinct> are so known in the past,
                        future, and present, but since they are emptiness, they are not perceived.
                        Why is that? Because that is their nature. And just like the eyes, so is the
                        nature of the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind also emptiness. What, then,
                        is an examination into the eyes? It is a searching inquiry into the eyes.
                        And how does one inquire into the eyes? Well, the eyes are not perceived in
                        the eyes. Why is that? Because if the eyes had eyes, then there would be two
                        sets of eyes and there would be a person present within. In that way, that
                        which is the designation of ‘eyes’ consists of a designation, a phenomenon,
                        and eyes. </p>

                        any true foundation?’ When investigating it in that way, they will think, ‘These
                        all belong to the domain of language and possess no basis for a true
                        foundation. Why is that? What is comprehended and communicated through
                        language is mundane. What is mundane is not transcendent. What is not
                        transcendent is a position held by the nirgranthas. It is an expression of
                        the nirgranthas. The expressions of the nirgranthas are not the speech of

                        in order to end speech, not to accumulate expressions.’</p>

                        beings. That is how they appear as eyes. The effect of delighting in the
                        eyes is that beings manifest as a result of thinking that the eyes are the
                        self and belong to the self. Therefore, they are called
                            <distinct>existence</distinct>. One begins to grasp based on them. What
                        is grasping? It is taking on suffering. And what is suffering? It is
                        grasping to “I” and “mine.” Both are limbs in this context, and that is why

                        engender great compassion when seeing beings afflicted with suffering.
                        Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas strive for the profound Dharma,
                        pursue only the profound Dharma, and perfectly teach only the profound
                        Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, what are the profound dharmas in which they become
                        stable? And what, Śāradvatī­putra, is their stability? Śāradvatī­putra,
                        bodhisattvas are called <distinct>stable</distinct> because they do not
                        become discouraged or despondent about unexcelled and perfect awakening.
                        Śāradvatī­putra, when it is said that they are stable, it is because they
                        grasp the dharmas. What dharmas do they grasp? Dharmas 
                        can be grasped with the eyes; but, Śāradvatī­putra, what the eyes grasp is not
                        dharmas, which are not something held. What, then, is the Dharma,
                        Śāradvatī­putra? It is by nature neither inside, nor outside. It has neither
                        a self, nor does it belong to a self. It has neither affliction, nor
                        purification. <ref cRef="F.128.b" type="folio"/> Dharmas are grasped by the

                        not the mind and so forth. Śāradvatī­putra, <distinct>Dharma</distinct> is something that has
                        neither a self, nor does it belong to a self; it has neither inside, nor

                        nor cessation. Why, Śāradvatī­putra? Because that is its nature—its
                        nature is not something made, and does not change, and therefore mind is called
                            <distinct>Dharma</distinct>. </p>

                        It enables the grasping of emptiness, and the grasping of signlessness and
                        wishlessness. It enables the grasping of non-perception as wishlessness, for
                        non-perception is wishlessness. Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, dharmas are

                        explained, who can comprehend that topic? It is like the following analogy,
                        Śāradvatī­putra. When the great nāga king Sāgara (Ocean) makes it rain, he
                        does so only in his own place, the ocean. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra,
                        there is no place whatsoever, aside from a place consecrated by a
                        thus-gone one, that can withstand the torrent of water from the great nāga
                        king Sāgara. In the same way, Śāradvatī­putra, when a thus-gone one teaches
                        on the nature of a thus-gone one and speaks about the characteristics of a
                        buddha’s wisdom, I have never seen in the realms of beings any hearer,
                        solitary buddha, or ordinary being who can understand it fully, that is,
                        aside from a bodhisattva who has perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle and
                        been authorized by a thus-gone one. </p>

                        be difficult, one should think, ‘This is a demonstration of my karma.

                        delight in what is free of anguish, flawless, and tranquil.” Well, Prince,
                        the conduct of bodhisattvas has many faults. <ref cRef="F.147.a" type="folio"/> Those faults are the faults of births, destinies,
                        saṃsāra, attachment, anger, untimely requests, and giving up pleasing
                        objects, the last of which involves the fault of giving away eyes, ears,
                        nose, tongue, and body. The conduct of a bodhisattva thus involves a great
                        many faults. If one does not give rise to the mind set on awakening, the
                        faults are fewer, so it is excellent that you think that whether something
                        has many or few faults, neither should be relied upon. Prince, I did not
                        know how circumspect and wise you are. I have seen your<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-048-001-1482" index="59"> K<hi rend="subscript">Y</hi>,

                        that. Indeed, since both involve a fall into error, one should neither rely on
                        something with many faults nor on something with few faults. Prince, the main
                        point here is just this: nirvāṇa is the abandonment of all aggregates.
                        Prince, what is the benefit of repeatedly experiencing the faulty existences
                        of saṃsāra where one will have to repeatedly die? Rather, you should aspire
                        for nirvāṇa. Prince, for beings to dwell in the womb is suffering.
                        Separation from the desirable and encountering the undesirable is suffering.
                        Prince, to take the body, which is without essence and impermanent, to be
                        one’s leader is suffering. The impermanence of the life force is suffering.
                        The impermanence and essencelessness of pleasures is suffering. Prince,
                        dying over and over again is suffering. Prince, that is why I say to you,
                        the appearance of a thus-gone one, the obtainment of a human birth,
                        excellent leisure, and unexcelled faith in a thus-gone one’s teaching are
                        difficult to obtain. <ref cRef="F.147.b" type="folio"/> Therefore, Prince,
                        having obtained these things, do not throw them away! Prince, since those
                        are the points that I wished to teach and explain, and that you wished to
                        respond to, you have listened. Since you have stayed for what I have taught,
                        that is your instruction, so you can listen and judge!’</p>

                        death being suffering, and likewise, about how everything up to turning
                        repeatedly in saṃsāra is the same. You also said, “May you swiftly reach
                        nirvāṇa.” Upon hearing your words my compassion for beings welled up. As

                        and royal palaces throughout the trichiliocosm. Thus they utterly quench the
                        craving of innumerably countless beings—the craving of beings in the desire
                        realms, the form realms, and the formless realms.</p>

                        same lines, the water of the ocean is also the waters that flow into it
                        separately—it is the same water. Just as one should understand that
                        those waters will all obtain the same salty flavor, so too, Śāradvatī­putra, one

                        thus-gone ones themselves, it becomes a receptacle for all buddha qualities
                        in their entirety and for the perpetual insight of all beings. As soon as
                        those who harbor a variety of doubts about the Dharma see such bodhisattvas,
                        they will instantly be free of doubts and, regardless of their former names,
                        henceforth be known as ‘the Thus-Gone One’s hearer.’ Śāradvatī­putra,
                        accordingly, just as the ocean has a singular salty taste, so will his
                        excellent hearers be liberated, and thus liberated, all have the same taste

                        and consider all that happened as the entire range of consequences

                        Śāradvatī­putra, along these lines, for example, anyone who interferes with
                        bodhisattvas, discouraging them from the mind of awakening, is identical to
                        someone nowadays who would maliciously engender the intention to draw my
                        blood. Or, Śāradvatī­putra, setting aside engendering the intention to draw
                        my blood, those noble sons and daughters engender a much larger heap of
                        faults than even committing all five sins of immediate retribution, which I
                        have explained as so difficult to endure, atone for, and recover from. This
                        is because, Śāradvatī­putra, committing the five sins of immediate
                        retribution does not make obstacles for any qualities of the buddhas
                        whatsoever, yet laying waste to a bodhisattva’s engendering of the mind of
                        awakening lays waste to all awakened qualities. Śāradvatī­putra, just as

                        futility. Those who object to hollowness and futility argue with the
                        Thus-Gone One. Those who argue with the Thus-Gone One fall off a steep
                        cliff. And what is the steep cliff, Śāradvatī­putra? It is the hells, the
                        animal realm, and the world of Yama. The true steep cliff is as follows:
                        belief in perception, belief in the aggregates, belief in the
                        elements, belief in the sense sources, belief in a life force, belief in
                        emergence, belief in disintegration, belief in sentient beings, and belief
                        in persons. Śāradvatī­putra, in short, even belief in nirvāṇa is a
                        perception, as are belief in the Buddha, belief in the Dharma, and belief in
                        the Saṅgha. Immature, ordinary beings attached to those beliefs will fall

                        from his seat, he draped his robe over one shoulder, bowed to the Blessed
                        One with palms joined, and said, “Blessed One, I do not want to fall off
                        such a cliff, nor argue with the Thus-Gone One, but I do want to awaken to
                        unexcelled and perfect awakening. So I am wondering, Blessed One, how can I,
                        a poor and destitute person, fully awaken to buddhahood when I live off the
                        wealth of others, gaining the luxury of a home through negative conduct and
                        hardship? Perfectly accomplishing awakening is for great, sāla tree-like

                        are like a great sāla tree, or to those of the householder caste who are
                        like a great sāla tree. Nor do I especially teach to nobles, to the wealthy,
                        or to gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, or

                        they are, as well as their acute and felicitous eloquence, and thus

                        they apply themselves to the practice of renunciation and are never contented
                        when pursuing the Dharma. Having heard the Dharma and pursued it, they share

                        never lazy to teach the Dharma, and with a knowledge that all phenomena
                        perish, they practice non-referential concentration; they also cultivate
                        recollecting the Buddha for the sake of awakening, with the thought that the
                        Buddha is the most exalted among all beings. They do not apprehend any marks

                        when seeing beings suffering, they act compassionately and consistently
                        exert effort. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas delight in the qualities of the

                        treasure of the great jewel of the Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva

                        like the Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa mountain ranges. Śāradvatī­putra, since
                        bodhisattva great beings perfectly teach the Dharma without end, they are

                        inexhaustible, bodhisattva great beings do not know exhaustion.

                        great beings fully reveal the light of Dharma, they are like the sun.
                        Śāradvatī­putra, since bodhisattva great beings dispel darkness, they are

                    <p tid="1797">Śāradvatī­putra, imagine if all beings knew, as I do, how
                        bodhisattvas abide by such actions on their behalf. Śāradvatī­putra, suppose
                        that all beings then were to give bodhisattvas all their happiness,
                        love, and joy, while carrying the bodhisattvas on their shoulders or heads
                        from the time when bodhisattvas first give rise to the mind of awakening up
                        until when they sit down at the seat of awakening. And suppose that once
                        bodhisattvas reach the seat of awakening, all beings were to lay out a
                        single carpet of precious fabric extending from the earth to the peak of
                        existence, and with the thought, ‘How terrible if the bodhisattva’s body
                        were to get too hot,’ they were also to have parasols of divine materials
                        held up all around covering them. Suppose, moreover, that all beings were
                        also to worship, revere, and honor them with flowers, incense, garlands, and
                        unguents. Śāradvatī­putra, even respecting, honoring, and worshiping the
                        bodhisattva great beings by performing such actions on their behalf would not be
                        able to repay them. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra, these pleasures do not
                        approach even one hundredth of the assistance provided by bodhisattvas
                        as they furnish all beings with the pleasure of freedom from torment—no
                        comparison whatsoever would suffice. This is because, Śāradvatī­putra,
                        everything provided by beings is impermanent, mundane, <ref cRef="F.186.a" type="folio"/> associated with the aggregates, defiled, and mutable;
                        whereas, Śāradvatī­putra, the happiness provided by bodhisattvas is
                        undefiled, supramundane, trustworthy, devoid of intrinsic nature, and
                        emptiness. Śāradvatī­putra, this is why beings cannot benefit bodhisattvas
                        with any of the pleasures in their possession. Śāradvatī­putra, this is
                        because bodhisattvas are those who awaken all slumbering beings. They are
                        the circumspect for careless beings. They are the sane for insane beings.
                        Śāradvatī­putra, they are the eyes for blind beings. They are their guides.
                        Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattva great beings are the medicine for beings
                        afflicted with disease. They show the way to those who have embarked on the
                        wrong path. They show the correct way to those who have strayed.
                        Bodhisattvas inspire those who have not engendered roots of virtue to do so.
                        Bodhisattvas inspire those who have not engendered wholesome qualities to do
                        so. Thus, Śāradvatī­putra, in short, beings have no protection, refuge, or
                        savior except for thus-gone ones and bodhisattvas, for, Śāradvatī­putra, the
                        Buddha too has emerged from bodhisattvas.”</p>

                        Moreover, it is amazing how much it beautifies themselves as well as others.
                        Blessed One, to give a simile, it is like a pāriyātra tree whose branches are all

                        play, and frolic. Likewise, Blessed One, bodhisattva great beings, once they
                        fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood, are replete with the
                        qualities of the buddhas. In this way, while beautifying themselves, they
                        also cause immeasurable, innumerable beings to journey there too. Beings

                        Blessed One, we are encouraged and pleased to be given and taught another
                        teaching. For otherwise, Blessed One, in the future we would lack the power

                        Śāradvatī­putra, how do monks come to dwell in a place with Dharma, and not

                        of the blessed ones and, by not considering this lack as faulty, fail to

                    <p tid="1817">“Śāradvatī­putra, there are four factors which, if noble 
                        sons and daughters possess them,
                        will cause them to abandon the awakening of the buddhas.
                        What are those four factors? Śāradvatī­putra, when noble sons or daughters
                        fall into the hands of evil companions and not into the hands of spiritual
                        friends, they will attend upon <ref cRef="F.191.b" type="folio"/>, serve,
                        and honor those evil companions; and through so attending upon, serving, and
                        honoring those evil companions, they will emulate them and thereby abandon
                        awakening. Moreover, Śāradvatī­putra, through strong attachment to self,
                        bodhisattvas begin to perceive in terms of reference points, and then, upon
                        hearing such profound Dharma discourses, they become terrified and out of
                        fright jump off a very steep cliff; Śāradvatī­putra, sons and daughters of
                        noble family with that second factor are made to abandon awakening.
                        Furthermore, Śāradvatī­putra, noble sons and daughters who follow the
                        proponents of the nirgranthas, or who apply the spells of the materialists,
                        may be respected by many people, and that being the case, they do not consider the qualities
                        of the buddhas and so are made to abandon them. Furthermore,
                        Śāradvatī­putra, bodhisattvas with perverted and degenerate discipline, who
                        do not emulate those with proper training, abandon those who advocate
                        austerity, criticize them, and have no devotion for them. Śāradvatī­putra,
                        noble sons or daughters with those four factors are made to abandon
                        awakening.”</p>

                        from decline even as little as a single verse. Upholding the Dharma, or
                        supporting those who preach the Dharma, they disregard life and limb, but
                        they do not abandon the Dharma. Śāradvatī­putra, if bodhisattvas who have
                        perfectly embarked on the Great Vehicle possess those four qualities they
                        will attain the specific qualities taught previously.”</p>

                        thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha called Jewel of Exalted Light.
                        That thus-gone one’s lifespan was half an eon. That blessed one had a

                        Merit. He was a coronated king of royal caste, who as a righteous Dharma
                        king with sovereignty over the world of the four continents guarded his
                        dominion over the four borders. The Jambudvīpa of that time had eight

                        leagues in size. They were all wealthy, healthy, happy, abundant in food,
                        pleasant, and well populated. </p>

                        eighty leagues in circumference and checkered in design, with each square a

                        palace. That large garden was surrounded all around by seven rows of palm

                        at the royal palace. Dṛḍhamati, King Lord of Irreproachable Merit heard that

                        had been wandering through the land with his seven hundred million monks
                            <ref cRef="F.215.a" type="folio"/> and that they had now arrived at the
                        royal palace and taken up residence in the garden of the royal palace. So,
                        Dṛḍhamati, the king went before the thus-gone one Jewel of Exalted Light,
                        prostrated to the Blessed One’s feet, and sat to one side. Dṛḍhamati, the
                        thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Jewel of Exalted Light
                        understood the king’s intention and so he fully taught him a Dharma
                        discourse of the Bodhisattva Collection, which resolves the doubts of all
                        beings. Upon hearing it, the king experienced joy and happiness and became
                        elated and enraptured, so that he thought to himself, ‘I should most
                        certainly offer my own exquisitely adorned garden for the thus-gone one
                        Jewel of Exalted Light to enjoy.’ With this thought, the king offered the
                        garden for the Thus-Gone One to enjoy. The king also commissioned seven
                        hundred million rest houses, seven hundred million promenades, and seven
                        hundred million seats. Having also offered seven hundred million parks,
                        together with attendants, he went before the Blessed One and asked, ‘Out of

                        perceived by way of non-apprehending. By adhering to that and not discarding
                        that connection, the awakened body of a thus-gone one will be actualized. By
                        bringing to mind the teaching of the Dharma, they also bring it before
                        themselves by means of the profound, the lucid, meanings, and syllables,
                        precisely how they are inclined toward it. Abiding in that absorption, they
                        are motivated by the perishability of all things to listen to the Dharma
                        taught by the thus-gone one. They are motivated to receive and uphold all
                        those teachings that are taught. Having received and upheld them, they rise
                        from that absorption and teach the fourfold retinue. That engagement and
                        that perception are, in this vein, the accomplishment of the absorption of
                            <distinct>the single array</distinct>. <ref cRef="F.219.a" type="folio"/>

                        Rising from that, they are also led to teach the Dharma to the

                        and that they themselves have not departed. They then think, ‘All phenomena

                        is obtained. They teach the Dharma, yet they do not truly see those

                    <p tid="2258">“Dṛḍhamati, it is like this, for example: Even while a thus-gone
                        one’s unimpeded wisdom partakes of the past, a thus-gone one’s wisdom also
                        has no impediment with respect to bodies. A thus-gone one’s wisdom does not
                        partake of the past by means of apprehending. Even though a thus-gone one’s

                        masters the past. However, with respect to the past, it does not follow
                        after any bodies as observed by a thus-gone one. The same also goes for the
                        future and the present. Dṛḍhamati, it is in this manner that while abiding
