                                        the Great Vehicle and how going forth from the life of a householder can be said to have the qualities of
                                        being noble and supramundane. Following the Buddha’s teaching, the two prominent monks Śāriputra and Subhūti

                                                the Buddha is teaching a large audience of monks and bodhisattvas. The teaching unfolds as the Buddha
                                                replies to a series of questions posed by two prominent monks, Śāriputra and Subhūti. Śāriputra,
                                                renowned for his pure observance of monastic discipline, first asks how monastic ordination can be
                                                said to have the qualities of being noble and supramundane. After the Buddha replies to Śāriputra,
                                                Subhūti asks Śāriputra to explain the Buddha’s instructions. Śāriputra then explains that the Buddha’s
                                                paradoxical response—in which he states that only those who do <emph>not</emph> transcend the

                                                renounced the world—is a teaching on the Great Vehicle doctrine of emptiness. When Śāriputra finishes
                                                his explanation, the Buddha grants his approval and tells Śāriputra that this teaching constitutes a
                                                “seal” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">phyag rgya</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mudrā</foreign>)
                                                that one may use to challenge beings who are overcome by pride that is driven by their conventional

                                        <p tid="10">Seven hundred monks attain liberation after hearing this teaching, but the controversy over its
                                                approach to renunciation and ordination leads a group of one hundred advanced monks to stand up and
                                                leave, while an even smaller group of five monks completely reject this teaching and fall into the
                                                hell realms. The Buddha takes this opportunity to point out that this understanding of “going forth”
                                                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rab tu byung ba</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">pravrajita</foreign>) may be considered something that the entire world finds disagreeable,
                                                but it is nevertheless true. He explains that since ordinary, worldly beings are ultimately
                                                nonexistent, one should not object to this teaching simply because the entire world finds it
                                                unacceptable. The doctrine of emptiness is thus applied to the “realm of beings” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sems can gyi khams</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sattvadhātu</foreign>) in exactly the same way that it is applied to the “realm of phenomena”
                                                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">chos kyi dbyings</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharmadhātu</foreign>) to discourage any tendency toward rejecting the doctrine of emptiness
                                                simply because it does not accord with the way things appear for ordinary beings. </p>
