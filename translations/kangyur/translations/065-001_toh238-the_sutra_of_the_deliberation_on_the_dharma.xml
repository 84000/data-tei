                                        bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. Among them, the bodhisattva
                                        Nirārambha takes center stage, delivering long discourses

                                                Buddhist saṅgha. Though the Buddha does teach in
                                                this sūtra, his primary role is to confirm and

                                                expressions of the Dharma. The majority of the
                                                teachings are instead delivered by a host of
                                                bodhisattvas and śrāvakas present in his assembly.

                                                it is the title by which the sūtra is cited in

                                                content of the sūtra. In perhaps its most basic

                                                to a gathering of the Buddhist saṅgha to

                                                communal oral rehearsal of the Dharma, but also to a
                                                gathering or “council” in which the Dharma is
                                                collectively confirmed, refined, and codified. It is
                                                just such a gathering that is depicted here in

                                                The sūtra describes an event in which the saṅgha has
                                                gathered to listen to the teachings of the Buddha,
                                                to discuss and debate the Dharma among themselves,
                                                and then to present their understanding to the
                                                Buddha as a way of refining that understanding and
                                                ultimately receiving confirmation that it is genuine
                                                and correct. The notion of a “Dharma council” would
                                                eventually take on a new shade of meaning after the
                                                passing of the Buddha, when the responsibility to

                                                because the sūtra is composed of numerous individual
                                                discourses delivered by a range of figures that

                                                discourses, a given member of the saṅgha presents or
                                                discusses their understanding of the Dharma and then
                                                asks the Buddha if their discourse is in accord with
                                                his. The Buddha consistently agrees that it is,

                                                  sūtra consists of his long monologues on a wide
                                                  range of Great Vehicle topics and themes.
                                                  Following Nirārambha’s discourses, a host of
                                                  śrāvakas and bodhisattvas rise from their seats to
                                                  present their understanding of the Great Vehicle
                                                  through a series of individual discourses. The
                                                  Buddha confirms each discourse to be in perfect
                                                  accord with his realization and teachings, thereby
                                                  authorizing their statements as the genuine Dharma
                                                  to be upheld and propagated. Thus, while <title xml:lang="en">The Dharma Council</title> is a

                                                  divided into two long sections. In the first,
                                                  Nirārambha responds to Mativikrama’s questions on

                                                  with numerous sets of ten such approaches. Each
                                                  set of ten is unpacked at length, thereby

                                                  Mativikrama engages Nirārambha in a further
                                                  dialogue on specific points of the Dharma. Here,
                                                  Mativikrama asks about the six perfections, the
                                                  nature of awakening, the four truths of the noble

                                                  among other topics. Nirārambha’s discourse on the
                                                  ten applications of mindfulness is particularly
                                                  detailed and extensive and takes up most of this
                                                  section of his teaching. Throughout his discourse,
                                                  no matter the specific topic, Nirārambha returns
                                                  again and again to the themes of emptiness, love
                                                  and compassion, and nonconceptuality, thus
                                                  underscoring the nondualistic and altruistic
                                                  orientation at the heart of bodhisattva practice.
                                                  When the two bodhisattvas conclude their dialogue,
                                                  they approach the Buddha to seek confirmation of
                                                  their understanding of the Dharma. Śākyamuni
                                                  readily approves, declaring their discourse to be
                                                  in accord with the discourse of all buddhas and to

                                                  Mativikrama cedes the stage, but Nirārambha’s
                                                  central role continues. For the remainder of the
                                                  sūtra Nirārambha stays near the Buddha, fielding
                                                  questions from members of the assembly and posing
                                                  questions of his own to Śākyamuni. The first to
                                                  speak is the Buddha’s great śrāvaka disciple
                                                  Śāriputra, who rises from the assembly to ask
                                                  Nirārambha about the meaning of his name, which
                                                  can be interpreted to mean “disengaged,” and
                                                  presses him further on some of the points he made
                                                  in his earlier discourse. Nirārambha’s responses
                                                  to Śāriputra’s many questions again focus on
                                                  emptiness, nonduality, and nonconceptuality as the
                                                  determining principles behind not only his own,
                                                  but all bodhisattvas’ activities. Their
                                                  conversation involves much back-and-forth, and
                                                  some chiding from Nirārambha concerning
                                                  Śāriputra’s narrow and mistaken views, but in the
                                                  end Śāriputra accepts Nirārambha’s position as
                                                  superior to his own and rejoices in Nirārambha’s

                                                  Buddha to ask questions of his own. Briefly then,

                                                  of the text, the Buddha is the primary voice of
                                                  the Dharma. Following this relatively short
                                                  teaching, the remainder of the sūtra presents a

                                                  bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, as well as one god,

                                                  each case he confirms their understanding as a

                                                  follows him wherever he goes. The Buddha smiles at
                                                  this, and so initiates a short vignette on the
                                                  Buddha’s smile that is common to many sūtras: rays
                                                  of multicolored light shine forth from his mouth,
                                                  illuminate infinite world systems and bring relief
                                                  to the beings suffering there, and then return to
                                                  dissolve into the crown of the Buddha’s head. As
                                                  in other sūtras, this miraculous display prompts
                                                  Ānanda to ask why the Buddha is smiling so. It is
                                                  because the Buddha, pleased by Nirārambha’s
                                                  offering and his elucidation of the Dharma, is
                                                  about to give him the prophecy of his awakening to
                                                  complete buddhahood. Subhūti then turns to
                                                  Nirārambha to offer words of congratulations, but
                                                  Nirārambha detects in his statements the traces of
                                                  the narrow conceptual view of a śrāvaka and
                                                  critiques him. Following Nirārambha’s incisive
                                                  interrogation, Subhūti concedes that the
                                                  conventions of śrāvakas are the same as those of
                                                  worldly beings, which in Nirārambha’s view are
                                                  only appropriate to protect worldly beings, who
                                                  are scared of the ultimate, and not for noble
                                                  ones, who take joy in ultimate truth. Nirārambha
                                                  then summarizes the truth of emptiness, dependent
                                                  arising, and nonarising and explains that the
                                                  prophecy of buddhahood is for those for whom
                                                  success does not exist, who feel no joy in hearing
                                                  the prophecy, and who do not leave ordinary people
                                                  behind.</p>

                                                  to the Buddha and involves a conversation not with
                                                  a bodhisattva or śrāvaka, but with a god named

                                                  about the scope of a bodhisattva’s awakening, and

                                                  their path. The Buddha’s instruction consists of a
                                                  long series of pithy statements that, much like

                                                  teaching, Excellent Mind presents his own

                                                  before him had, and the Buddha confirms his
                                                  understanding as a clear and effective
                                                  articulation of the Dharma.</p>

                                                  the Buddha: who present in the assembly has the
                                                  courage to uphold and propagate this approach to
                                                  the Dharma? A number of the bodhisattvas who
                                                  previously spoke again rise to make a final
                                                  statement of their commitment, and in each case
                                                  the words of their promises are directly related
                                                  to their name or a well-known quality. Thus,
                                                  Nirārambha (“Disengaged”) says that he will do so
                                                  while free of engagement; Avalokiteśvara (“The

                                                  compassion) will do so through great compassion;
                                                  Maitreya (“Loving”) will do so through love;
                                                  Priyadarśana (“Pleasing to Behold”) will do by
                                                  satisfying those beings who behold him; Sārthavāha
                                                  (“Caravan Leader” or “Captain”) will guide beings
                                                  while putting their welfare above his own; and
                                                  Mañjuśrī (associated with wisdom) will do so
                                                  through correct orientation to the path. The
                                                  Buddha once again approves of these statements and
                                                  confirms their efficacy. The sūtra then comes to a

                                                staying in an incomparable mansion that was so vast
                                                as to be indistinct from the center of the expanse
                                                of phenomena that extends throughout the domain of
                                                space. It was a miraculous emanation of his own
                                                accumulation of merit and wisdom, and it was unlike
                                                any contrived phenomena in the three worlds.
                                                Completely beyond comparison, it was born from the
                                                Thus-Gone One’s inconceivable karmic ripening. He

                                                liberated from the two factors. Also present were
                                                exceedingly pure bodhisattva great beings who were
                                                constantly in samādhi, <ref cRef="F.2.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1224"/> who

                                                What are these ten? (1) The root of all afflictive
                                                emotions is aspiration because the afflictive
                                                emotions arise from aspiration. The Thus-Gone One
                                                lacks aspiration. Because he is free of aspiration,
                                                it is said that the Thus-Gone One has passed into
                                                final nirvāṇa. (2) Because of his lack of
                                                aspiration, the Thus-Gone One does not grasp at any
                                                phenomena. Because he does not grasp, he does not
                                                accept or reject them. Because he is free of
                                                grasping, it is said that the Thus-Gone One has
                                                passed into final nirvāṇa. (3) The dharmakāya
                                                disrupts acceptance and rejection; it neither arises
                                                nor ceases. Because he is free of arising and
                                                ceasing, it is said that the Thus-Gone One has
                                                passed into final nirvāṇa. (4) That which is
                                                unarisen and unceasing is utterly ineffable. Because
                                                of being ineffable, it is said that the Thus-Gone
                                                One has passed into final nirvāṇa. (5) There is
                                                neither a self nor beings; phenomena simply
                                                transform through arising and ceasing. Therefore, it
                                                is said that the Thus-Gone One has passed into final
                                                nirvāṇa. (6) All the afflictive emotions and
                                                secondary afflictive emotions are adventitious.
                                                Because the expanse of phenomena neither comes nor
                                                goes, it is neither adventitious nor persistent.
                                                Because the expanse of phenomena is unvarying, it is
                                                said that the Thus-Gone One has passed into final
                                                nirvāṇa. (7) Suchness is true, while phenomena

                                                beings. <ref cRef="F.8.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1236"/> (2) The Thus-Gone
                                                One does not at all think, ‘The minds of these
                                                beings are afflicted by error, the afflictive
                                                emotions, and the secondary afflictive emotions. I
                                                should liberate them.’ Rather, the Thus-Gone One
                                                effortlessly and nonconceptually acts in alignment
                                                with the sense bases, faculties, and inclinations of
                                                beings who are impelled by their previous conceptual
                                                imputations. (3) The Thus-Gone One does not at all
                                                think, ‘I teach the sūtras, verse narrations,

                                                and nonconceptually teaches those beings the Dharma
                                                of the thus-gone ones. (4) The Thus-Gone One does
                                                not at all think, ‘I am entering this village, city,
                                                town, or market for alms.’ Nor does he think, ‘I am
                                                approaching a kṣatriya, brahmin, vaiśya, or śūdra; a
                                                king, prince, or royal minister; or some other
                                                person for alms.’ Rather, the Thus-Gone One engages
                                                with them through his activities of body, speech,
                                                and mind informed by his wisdom. (5) The Thus-Gone
                                                One does not have hunger or thirst, he does not
                                                defecate or urinate, nor does he have a weak body.
                                                He goes for alms but does not ask for or request
                                                food. In all situations he effortlessly and
                                                nonconceptually acts to ripen beings without giving
                                                up. <ref cRef="F.8.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1237"/> (6) The Thus-Gone
                                                One does not think, ‘This being is inferior, this
                                                one is average, and this one is superior. I’ll speak
                                                in an inferior way to this one, in an average way to
                                                this one, and in a superior way to this one.’
                                                Rather, he imparts the teachings of the thus-gone
                                                ones nonconceptually, without addition or omission,
                                                in accord with the recipient. (7) The Thus-Gone One
                                                does not think, ‘This being does not honor me, does
                                                not worship me, but disgraces me. I should not speak
                                                with that one at all. That one honors me, worships
                                                me, venerates me, and sings my praise. I should
                                                speak with that one.’ Rather, the Thus-Gone One is
                                                impartial, even toward rivals. (8) The Thus-Gone One
                                                is not arrogant, careless, attached, angry,
                                                covetous, possessive, clinging, servile, or subject
                                                to the secondary afflictive emotions. Rather, he
                                                speaks in praise of isolation from activity,
                                                isolation from desire, and of those who delight in
                                                isolation. (9) Because the Thus-Gone One has
                                                mirror-like wisdom, he has no lack of knowledge
                                                about, ignorance of, or misunderstanding of any kind
                                                concerning objects of knowledge. Seeing what is to
                                                be done and not done, he engages with beings as
                                                appropriate. (10) The Thus-Gone One is not pleased
                                                with beings with extensive wealth, nor displeased
                                                with beings who are poor. Rather, he extends great
                                                uninhibited love to those who have embarked on the
                                                correct path, and great uninhibited compassion to
                                                those who have embarked on a mistaken path. Child of
                                                good family, bodhisattvas should understand the

                                                through ten approaches to the way of the Dharma.
                                                What are these ten? (1) Take the example of the sun.
                                                It rises equally for and shines equally on all
                                                inferior, average, and superior beings, and on all
                                                of those with and without faith. Similarly, the
                                                thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha also
                                                equally rises for and shines the light of wisdom on
                                                inferior, average, and superior beings, and on those
                                                with and without faith. (2) Take the example of
                                                space. Its essential quality is that it does not
                                                obstruct any being in any way. Otherwise, it would
                                                always appear to have fleeting obscurations like
                                                smoke, clouds, dust, and fog. Similarly, the
                                                Thus-Gone One, like space, is essentially unobscured
                                                for all beings. Otherwise, because of being obscured
                                                by grasping at ‘I’ and ‘mine,’ which are comparable
                                                to fleeting smoke, clouds, dust, and fog, the
                                                Thus-Gone one would not be visible or accessible to
                                                beings. (3) Take the example of fire. Although fire
                                                can be found in all wood, without all the right
                                                conditions and effort it will not ignite, thus not
                                                fulfilling its own potential. Similarly, the
                                                Thus-Gone One is present in all objects of
                                                knowledge, but without all the right conditions,
                                                like faith and so forth, and without effort, he will
                                                not appear and will not perform awakened activities.
                                                (4) Take the example of pouring different colors
                                                into a single vessel, and then soaking different
                                                strips of cloth in those many colors. The colors
                                                will take based on the potency of the
                                                  container,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-142"> Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phur ma</foreign>,

                                                  inferred to refer to the container filled with the
                                                  mixed colors, rather than the individual colors
                                                  that were poured into it.</note> but the colors
                                                have no conscious influence. Similarly, beings see
                                                the Thus-Gone One and take on his good qualities
                                                based on the immersion of the threads of their
                                                belief in the many diverse collections of the roots
                                                of virtue accumulated by the Thus-Gone One. <ref cRef="F.9.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1239"/> (5) Take the
                                                example of a river filled with water. It flows
                                                downward when praised, and still flows downward when
                                                spoken to with enmity and curses. Similarly, whether
                                                one is praising or speaking badly of the Thus-Gone
                                                One, he proceeds with wisdom, not with pride. (6)
                                                Take the example of sugarcane. It is cut into many
                                                pieces but does not lose its sweet taste. Similarly,
                                                it does not matter if the Thus-Gone One is worshiped
                                                or not, when one attends to him the sweet taste of
                                                liberation is not lost. (7) Take the example of the
                                                earth. It persists without thinking or changing.
                                                Those who want profit from it plow it, cultivate it,
                                                and sow seeds so that their harvest will be
                                                abundant. Those who do not plow it, cultivate it, or
                                                sow seeds will not have an abundant harvest.
                                                Similarly, the Thus-Gone One, like the earth,
                                                persists without thinking or changing. Those who
                                                wish for good qualities and arouse faith, sincerity,
                                                and respect toward the Thus-Gone One will have an
                                                abundant harvest of good qualities. Those who do not
                                                arouse faith, sincerity, and respect toward the
                                                Thus-Gone One will not have an abundant harvest of
                                                good qualities. (8) Take, for example, the fact that
                                                some people denigrate sandalwood and camphor and say
                                                that it is bad, while still smearing their bodies
                                                with them. Sandalwood and camphor make them fragrant
                                                and not smell bad. Similarly, people say nasty
                                                things about the thus-gone, worthy, completely
                                                perfect Buddha, but after denigrating him, they
                                                serve and rely on him. The Thus-Gone One instills in
                                                those who revere him the fragrance of awakened
                                                qualities. (9) Take, for example, how a bridge, <ref cRef="F.10.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1240"/> causeway, or royal
                                                  road<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-143"> Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khri

                                                people, but rather permits easy travel equally.
                                                Similarly, the Thus-Gone One shows no bias for
                                                inferior, average, or superior beings, is not
                                                obscured, and engages them equally by moving with
                                                ease among them. (10) Take, for example, the king of
                                                medicines called <distinct>beautiful to

                                                mountains. As soon as it is seen, all the illnesses
                                                that beset all beings will disappear. Similarly, as
                                                soon as the Thus-Gone One is seen, all of the
                                                illnesses that beset all beings will be cured. Child

                                                Transmigration upon death does not ultimately exist.
                                                If transmigration upon death were to exist
                                                ultimately, the very same being who died would be
                                                the being who is born, entailing that the one who
                                                died would have two bodies upon birth: the body that
                                                transmigrated and the body in which they
                                                transmigrate. If transmigration were to exist, the
                                                five aggregates would also exist. Why? Because the
                                                consciousness that was freed from the aggregates
                                                would not have a point of access. <ref cRef="F.12.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1245"/> It is
                                                consciousness that approaches and enters form, and
                                                consciousness that approaches sensation, approaches
                                                perception, and approaches formations. It is
                                                consciousness that depends on them, observes them,
                                                and enters them. An unsupported consciousness would
                                                not enter for even a moment. Because transmigration
                                                upon death occurs in the same way as any persisting
                                                phenomenon arises—like a seed and a sprout—it is a

                                                Nirvāṇa does not ultimately exist. The pacification
                                                of saṃsāra is called nirvāṇa. Saṃsāra is not itself
                                                nirvāṇa, nor is nirvāṇa distinct from saṃsāra.
                                                Saṃsāra, like a dream or an illusion, neither exists
                                                nor does not exist, nor does it arise because of
                                                being both existent and nonexistent. Just as saṃsāra
                                                does not exist or not exist and does not arise
                                                through being both existent and nonexistent, it does
                                                not cease because of not existing, not

                                                and nonexistent. Alternatively, the cessation of
                                                perception and sensation is called nirvāṇa.
                                                Perception is just like a mirage; sensation is like
                                                a water bubble. Just as a mirages and water bubbles
                                                arise and cease, so it is with saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
                                                Therefore, the teaching on the peace of nirvāṇa is a
                                                conventional teaching.</p>

                                                substantial, it would be compounded and impermanent.
                                                If emptiness were insubstantial, the empty would not

                                                space is infinite, boundless, and naturally

                                                anything. In the same way, bodhisattvas who propound
                                                the Dharma have infinite and boundless good

                                                As a further analogy, when the sun rises all deep
                                                darkness vanishes, and by its shining light beings

                                                anyone. In the same way, when bodhisattvas who

                                                light beings cultivate their respective roots of
                                                virtue. Followers of the Dharma <term rend="ignore">form</term> no concepts at all and do not seek
                                                the slightest recompense from anyone. (8) As a
                                                further analogy, a sturdy, stable, well-joined boat
                                                is able to save beings from a mighty river without
                                                being destroyed, and it does so without seeking even
                                                the slightest recompense from anyone. In the same
                                                way, bodhisattvas who propound the Dharma are well
                                                endowed with stable insight and sturdy, perfect,
                                                great compassion. They are able to save beings from
                                                the mighty river of saṃsāra without being destroyed,
                                                and they do so without seeking even a small ferry
                                                toll. (9) As a further analogy, a bridge or causeway
                                                is located at a raging and terrifying river to put
                                                beings equally at ease, be they inferior, average,
                                                or superior. It does not hold any concepts of ‘I’ or
                                                ‘mine.’ In the same way, bodhisattvas who propound
                                                the Dharma serve as a great bridge or causeway that
                                                puts beings equally at ease—be they inferior,
                                                average, or superior—when facing saṃsāra that is
                                                difficult to cross, and the descent into the
                                                unbearable and cruel lower realms. While doing so
                                                they do not hold any concepts of ‘I’ or ‘mine.’ (10)

                                                equally for beings who are inferior, <ref cRef="F.20.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1260"/> average, and

                                                ‘mine.’ In the same way, bodhisattvas who propound
                                                the Dharma deploy the lamp of insight within the
                                                house of saṃsāra, which is dark with ignorance,

                                                birth, the attractive and unattractive, the inferior
                                                and superior, and they accurately see the way karma
                                                unfolds with its causes and results. A bodhisattva’s
                                                divine eyes lead to the attainment of awakened
                                                wisdom. That is certain.</p>

                                                form: sources and what comes from those sources. The
                                                types of forms that are sources are the elements of
                                                earth, water, fire, and air. The forms that come
                                                from those sources are colors, smells, tastes, and
                                                textures. Thus we arrive at eight types of form.
                                                After transcending perceptions of those kinds of
                                                forms, obstructing perceptions will not arise, and
                                                will decrease. Anytime there is a perception of form
                                                it is a perception of obstruction, and so
                                                perceptions of obstruction decrease when the
                                                perceptions of form are transcended. When
                                                perceptions of obstruction decrease, one no longer
                                                fixates on perceptions of manifoldness. And, by not
                                                fixating on perceptions of manifoldness, space is
                                                infinite.’ Thinking, ‘Space is infinite,’

                                                because it is empty. The perception is not something

                                                are like echoes. They quell killing, bondage, and

                                                reflected image. When abused, they do not respond
                                                with abuse due to the force of their understanding
                                                that the mind is an illusion. When they meet with
                                                anger, they do not respond with anger due to the
                                                force of their understanding of inner purity. They
                                                are not seduced by worldly phenomena due to the
                                                force of their understanding that worldly phenomena
                                                are pure. They are not under the sway of any

                                                bodhisattvas see the gateway to peace wherever they

                                                That is why bodhisattvas do not arrogantly think, ‘I

                                                for clinging. This is suffering. When bodhisattvas
                                                know that this suffering is dependently originated,

                                                perfected through the Dharma. All the mundane and

                                                through the Dharma. Therefore, other than seeking
                                                the awakening of buddhahood, the Dharma will be my
                                                main focus. I will remain in the scope of the
                                                Dharma, support the Dharma, be dedicated to the

                                                like the Dharma. The Dharma is constantly and
                                                uninterruptedly engaged; thus it is not something

                                                should therefore make my mind like the Dharma. The
                                                Dharma is never present anywhere; thus it is never
                                                out of reach at a moment of training. I should
                                                therefore make my mind like the Dharma. The Dharma
                                                lacks desire for anything, thus it has no anger
                                                toward those who are hostile nor attraction for
                                                those with faith. I should therefore make my mind
                                                like the Dharma. The Dharma neither diminishes nor
                                                increases, but rather is unfathomable and
                                                incalculable. Like space, it does not contract or
                                                expand. I should therefore make my mind like the
                                                Dharma. The Dharma is not protected by beings, it is
                                                the Dharma that protects beings. I should therefore
                                                make my mind like the Dharma. The Dharma does not
                                                seek refuge, the Dharma is the refuge for all
                                                worlds. I should therefore make my mind like the
                                                Dharma. The Dharma has the character of being
                                                unobstructed, thus it is not obstructed by anything.
                                                I should therefore make my mind like the Dharma. The
                                                Dharma lacks latent impressions; thus it is not
                                                concerned with latent impressions. I should
                                                therefore make my mind like the Dharma. The Dharma
                                                is always nonconceptual, thus it does not fear
                                                saṃsāra nor is it attracted to nirvāṇa. I should

                                                is vast. The saṅgha of those who seek training knows

                                                of mindfulness. The saṅgha of those compelled by
                                                diligence falls within the scope of correct
                                                abandonment. The saṅgha of the unwearied falls

                                                The saṅgha of the unrelenting falls within the scope
                                                of power. The saṅgha of the untroubled falls within
                                                the scope of strength. The saṅgha of the unobscured

                                                The saṅgha of those with correct view falls within
                                                the scope of the path. The saṅgha of noble ones
                                                falls within the scope of truth. The saṅgha of those
                                                with meditative composure falls within the scope of
                                                meditative stability. The saṅgha that turns the
                                                wheel of Dharma falls within the scope of dependent
                                                arising. The irreversible saṅgha possesses great
                                                compassion. And the saṅgha of those with only a

                                                How so? Discipline is the basis for all that is
                                                excellent and perfect. The earth, for example, is

                                                that is excellent and perfect. Bodhisattvas who

                                                perfects the practice of generosity. Bodhisattvas
                                                who maintain a basis of discipline experience joy.
                                                Joyful in mind, they have no regrets, and without
                                                regrets, they attain supreme joy. Through their
                                                supreme joy they become physically and mentally

                                                the Blessed One: “Blessed One, bodhisattvas who
                                                think, ‘I should discourse on the Dharma,’ are
                                                incapable of discoursing on the Dharma. Why? Because
                                                they believe in a self and think, ‘I teach, they
                                                listen.’ Those lacking the perception of a self do
                                                not teach the Dharma after imputing a self, after
                                                imputing an other, or after imputing both. They do
                                                not teach after forming latent impressions. Why?
                                                Blessed One, it is because all imputations are
                                                imputations based on nothing. Blessed One, an
                                                imputed phenomenon does not substantially exist. To
                                                elaborate, the Dharma is an imputation made by
                                                bodhisattva great beings who understand imputations.
                                                How so? Blessed One, the imputations of a
                                                bodhisattva who understands imputations are similar
                                                to describing a magical illusion. Blessed One, an
                                                imputation is called an imputation, so what is meant
                                                by ‘imputation,’ Blessed One? It is an imputation to
                                                not reject emptiness and dependent arising; it is to
                                                be in accord with the unarisen and unceasing; it is
                                                the transcendence of ideas, concepts, and paradigms;
                                                it is the disruption of clinging to ‘I’ and ‘mine’;
                                                it is the clearing away of all adopted views. That
                                                is the imputation of bodhisattva great beings who
                                                understand imputation. <ref cRef="F.65.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-065-001-1351"/> That

                                                correctly see what is genuinely not the Dharma.
                                                Blessed One, that which a bodhisattva correctly and
                                                genuinely sees as not the Dharma is the Dharma.
                                                Blessed One, the Dharma is not received from
                                                anything, nor is it revered in any way. There is no
                                                one on whom it depends, nor is it independent.
                                                Blessed One, the Dharma is not far away from
                                                anything or close at hand. The Dharma is not found

                                                One, the Dharma is not revealed through perceptions,
                                                nor it is revealed through nonperception. Why?
                                                Because the noble ones do not recognize anything
                                                that is free of perceptions that bind or
                                                nonperceptions that bind. Blessed One, there is no
                                                Dharma to reject, nor is there a Dharma to
                                                cultivate. One who transcends a Dharma that is
                                                rejected and cultivated is endowed with the Dharma.

                                                something that is not given? Because it has no

                                                there is no one to dispute with. Because there is no

                                                to understand the equality of all phenomena.
                                                Bodhisattvas who understand the equality of all

                                                of phenomena, and of the limit of reality. There are
                                                absolutely no phenomena that contradict the
                                                realization of omniscience. There are absolutely no
                                                phenomena to be found that contradict awakening to

                                                which is related to the awakening of buddhahood.

                                                bound by the prātimokṣa vow, but they do not think
                                                the prātimokṣa is itself sufficient. They adhere to
                                                the bodhisattva vow. Bodhisattvas perfectly observe
                                                the prescriptions and perspectives, but they do not
                                                think those prescriptions and perspectives are
                                                themselves sufficient. They also adhere to the
                                                prescriptions and perspectives of a bodhisattva.
                                                They are apprehensive of the most subtle disgraceful
                                                act, but also rely on the wisdom of a bodhisattva.
                                                What is the wisdom of a bodhisattva? Bodhisattvas
                                                are not scared or fearful of karma or the afflictive
                                                emotions because they understand the basic truth of
                                                all phenomena. They understand the basic truth of a
                                                bodhisattva. What is the perspective of a
                                                bodhisattva? Bodhisattvas take the perspective of
                                                emptiness; they do not take a conceptual, contrived,
                                                or fabricated perspective. They train in the basic
                                                precepts upon acceptance. To say they ‘train upon
                                                acceptance’ means that they train after accepting
                                                the equality of emptiness. To say they ‘train in the
                                                basic precepts upon acceptance’ means that they
                                                train after accepting the equality of signlessness,
                                                the equality of wishlessness, the equality of the
                                                unconditioned, and the equality of that which does
                                                not arise or appear. Blessed One, a bodhisattva also
                                                thinks, ‘I should establish beings in the discipline
                                                of the prātimokṣa vows.’ This is a bodhisattva’s

                                                Bodhisattvas are predisposed to good intentions;

                                                of all beings, not their own. Bodhisattvas are

                                                Bodhisattvas are predisposed to practice; they are

                                                with the factors of awakening. Bodhisattvas are

                                                to benefit beings. Bodhisattvas are predisposed to

                                                Bodhisattvas are predisposed to meditative
                                                concentration; they are not disturbed by any sounds
                                                or the need to act. Bodhisattvas are predisposed to
                                                insight; they see all phenomena as equal to a
                                                buddha’s awakening. Bodhisattvas are predisposed to
                                                emptiness; they do not remain in saṃsāra.
                                                Bodhisattvas are predisposed to great compassion;
                                                they do not pass into nirvāṇa.</p>

                                                slip from their memory. It is the means by which
                                                they examine the conduct of all beings and, upon
                                                examination, engage with them appropriately. It is

                                                One: “If a bodhisattva were to define the
                                                perfections, Blessed One, mistaken worldly people
                                                would say, ‘A bodhisattva is defined by the
                                                perfections.’ If, Blessed One, a bodhisattva were
                                                defined by the perfections, all beings would also be
                                                bodhisattvas. Blessed One, bodhisattvas cultivate
                                                and understand the perfections. Once they have been
                                                cultivated, they then explain them to others. For
                                                that reason, Blessed One, bodhisattvas are said to
                                                cultivate an unborn path, present an unarisen path,
                                                and express the inexpressible. Blessed One,
                                                bodhisattvas are not protected by the perfections;
                                                rather, they protect the perfections. For that
                                                reason bodhisattvas are said to uphold the sublime
                                                Dharma. Blessed One, bodhisattvas are not held by
                                                the perfections; rather, bodhisattvas uphold the
                                                perfections. For this reason they are said to be
                                                Dharma holders.</p>
