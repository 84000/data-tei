                    concerned with well-known Mahāyāna Buddhist themes, ranging from the lack of
                    inherent identity to the qualities of complete awakening, but these topics are
                    here presented within a larger exegesis on the meaning of the dhāraṇī

                            Boundless Gateways</title> is the second scripture among the forty-nine

                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-4"/>
                    <p tid="10">The sūtra takes the form of a conversation between the Buddha and
                        the bodhisattva Anantavyūha. The teaching itself commences when Anantavyūha
                        requests from the Buddha a <distinct>dhāraṇī gateway</distinct>. This is an
                        important concept common to many Great Vehicle sūtras. As a magical formula,
                        a <distinct>dhāraṇī</distinct> constitutes a gateway to the infinite
                        qualities of awakening, the awakened state itself, and the various forms of
                        buddha activity. Just as those qualities are innumerable, so are the dhāraṇī
                        gateways. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñā­pāramitā­śāstra</title>
                        explains the term by comparing a <distinct>dhāraṇī gateway</distinct> to a
                            <distinct>samādhi gateway</distinct>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-5"> Lamotte 2001, pp. 1541–2.</note> Just as a
                        samādhi gateway allows access to any desired quality or magical power, so
                        too can a dhāraṇī gateway. The difference is that while the samādhi comes
                        and goes, the dhāraṇī never leaves those who have “obtained” it, following
                        them like a shadow from life to life. This is because, when realizing or
                        “obtaining” a dhāraṇī, one becomes “sealed” by it. Hence a dhāraṇī is often
                        also called a <distinct>dhāraṇī seal</distinct>.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-6"/>
                    <p tid="11">The word <distinct>dhāraṇī</distinct> derives from the Sanskrit
                        verbal root √<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhṛ</foreign> (“to
                        hold,” “support,” “contain,” “retain,” or “remember”). The sense of
                            <distinct>containing</distinct> could be applied to both the formula,
                        which magically “contains” certain qualities, and the person who has
                        obtained this dhāraṇī formula or seal. Once it has been obtained, that
                        person becomes “sealed” or “stamped” with whatever quality the dhāraṇī
                        contains and subsequently has the power to activate this quality or invoke
                        the corresponding buddha activity. Though not explicit in the literal
                        meaning of the term, a dhāraṇī is always a vehicle for the blessing of the
                        buddhas and the magical power sealed therein. The sūtras and commentaries
                        often describe the dhāraṇī power of retaining things in memory, but dhāraṇīs
                        can also function as the gateway to innumerable other qualities, such as
                        loving kindness, compassion, and so forth, and invoke any kind of awakened
                        activity. As for the dhāraṇī formula itself, being a supplication or a
                        command with a message, a dhāraṇī tends to be longer than the average
                        mantra. It may also, and often does, include words devoid of lexical
                        meaning. Perhaps the dhāraṇīs, with their tendency to include vernacular
                        forms and seemingly alliterative derivations, were intended to resonate with
                        the native speakers of the language, directly impacting their minds and
                        feelings. Thus, the alliterative forms in the dhāraṇīs that seem
                        unintelligible to us might have been intelligible to the native speakers of
                        the period, or at least conjured up the meanings and feelings evoked by
                        similar-sounding words known to them.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-7"/>
                    <p tid="12">A dhāraṇī cannot be reduced to a simple spell, however. Anantavyūha
                        remarks, “this dhāraṇī gateway is as wide as the sky; it is a peerless great
                        gateway. For that reason, it is described with words such as
                            <distinct>immeasurable</distinct> and <distinct>limitless</distinct>.”
                        This is not to say that the conversation does not focus on the unique
                        efficacy of the actual dhāraṇī syllables. The Buddha explains that “dhāraṇīs
                        are the condensation, the inclusion, the main essence, and the heart of

                        Accordingly, dhāraṇīs are first and foremost potent, condensed speech. To
                        penetrate them necessitates that one engages deeply with language and
                        internalizes an understanding of the Sanskrit alphabet in particular.
                        According to the sūtra, dhāraṇīs are not fanciful magic, for part of their
                        efficacy hinges on the inseparable connection that exists between language
                        and the phenomenal world. </p>

                    <p tid="13">Like most Great Vehicle sūtras, this text reinforces the need for
                        its own preservation via a discussion of why it is vital that all
                        bodhisattvas take up the practice of this dhāraṇī. This spurs in turn a
                        discussion of the benefits of having excelled in the dhāraṇī: nothing less
                        than the achievement of the <term>ten powers</term> of a buddha, the factors
                        of awakening, and the four types of fearlessness. Each of these traditional
                        Buddhist lists is given its own unique treatment. Several dhāraṇīs are
                        presented, including a series of spells that enable the practitioner to
                        subdue Māra and to invoke and summon a variety of different gods of
                        different locales, including Śakra, Brahmā, and the four great kings along
                        with their retinues. Each of the latter will in turn bestow on the
                        practitioner a variety of powers. The audience is finally urged to uphold
                        and practice the sūtra’s instructions in a series of exhortations that
                        encapsulate many of the sūtra’s central themes in an extended set of verses. </p>

                        According to the colophon to the Tibetan translation, the sūtra was
                        translated into Tibetan by the translator Kawa Paltsek (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">under the name </foreign>Paltsek Rakṣita) and the
                        Indian preceptor Surendrabodhi, who both participated in numerous translation
                        projects in Tibet during the early translation period. The Chinese canon
                        also contains a translation of this sūtra (T. 310–2), which was produced
                        during the early eighth century by Bodhiruci (d. 727), a renowned translator
                        who originally hailed from South India. This Bodhiruci is responsible for
                        translating much of the Heap of Jewels collection, among other texts, into
                        Chinese. This English translation was based primarily on the Tibetan Degé
                        edition, with consultation of the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>). </p>

                        whatsoever that they comprehend or realize. Why is that? Because all Dharma
                        teachings <ref cRef="F.50.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-481"/> have been explained and taught

                            <distinct>non-Dharma</distinct>. All imputed phenomena are ultimately
                        beyond imputation. The Thus-Gone One has taught how to endeavor correctly in
                        the true reality of phenomena. Dharma and non-Dharma are not established
                        through conceptualization or through the absence of conceptualization. Since
                        all phenomena are conceptually equal, they are beyond conceptualization.
                        Since all phenomena are comprehended distinctly, they are beyond
                        distinction. Since all phenomena are beyond origination, they are unborn.
                        Since all phenomena are identified and brought into being through inaccurate
                        conceptualization, they are unreal. Since all phenomena must come into
                        being, they are beyond arising. Because phenomena do not come into contact,
                        they do not interact. Since all phenomena are the <term type="ignore">perfection</term> of sameness, they are beyond dependence. Since there
                        is no acceptance or rejection of any phenomena, they are beyond engagement;
                        this is the unique fulfillment of the activity of aspiration. All phenomena
                        lack identity, and because they transcend identity there is no concept of
                            <distinct>mine</distinct>. Since all these phenomena are beyond
                        elaboration, they are equal, without distinction. Even if qualities are
                        accomplished just as one has aspired, there is no aspiration whatsoever.
                        Since all these phenomena tend towards dependence, they are nothing
                        whatsoever. For those reasons, the Thus-Gone One has taught the nature of
                        all these phenomena to be like a dream or an illusion; with respect to the
                        nature of different phenomena, there are not the slightest distinctions of

                        it is a Dharma illumination by which bodhisattvas’ unique and perfect
                        aspirations flourish and excel. Therefore, the children of noble family who
                        are devoted to this mode of Dharma teaching cultivate this light of the
                        Dharma. Anantavyūha, bodhisattvas who reflect properly on an inward level
                        while not letting their attention be distracted outwardly, who are stable in
                        the abandonment of obscurations, who recollect the illumination of the

                        Dharma should investigate this teaching. This teaching has been given by the
                        Thus-Gone One to elicit expertise in what is conditioned. He has explained
                        that those phenomena whose identity is to be conditioned are hollow, fake,
                        void, essenceless, false, and deceptive by nature. The causes and conditions
                        that make beings afflicted are also hollow, fake, void, essenceless, false,
                        and deceptive. Even if you were to search throughout the worlds of the ten
                        directions, you could never perceive or observe causes and conditions that
                        lead beings to purity. These cannot be observed because they are beyond
                        grasper and grasped and are nonexistent. If the Thus-Gone One has determined
                        that phenomena are to be abandoned, what need is there to mention the
                        abandonment of non-phenomena? What is abandoned is beyond being adopted; it
                        is spontaneously present and intrinsically pure and thus does not know even
                        the slightest existence. When all phenomena are comprehended precisely as
                        they inherently are, there is no thinking or conceptualizing. Since all
                        phenomena are not otherwise, <ref cRef="F.51.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-483"/> their basis
                        cannot be identified. Therefore all these phenomena are groundless and
                        baseless. They are verbal labels, and verbal labels are void. They persist
                        without inherent identity, yet they do not persist. They are baseless, and
                        because they have no basis they do not remain. The Thus-Gone One has taught
                        using synonyms such as <distinct>ending</distinct>,
                            <distinct>transformation</distinct>, and <distinct>cessation</distinct>.

                        sameness, one comes to know and understand all such phenomena. By knowing,
                        one should abandon. By knowing, one should actualize. By knowing, one should
                        cultivate. Thus what is known is understood, what is understood is
                        abandoned, the abandonment is what is actualized, and what is actualized is
                        taught to be cultivation. Understanding the Dharma of the noble ones in this
                        way, one accomplishes the truth nonconceptually while remaining diligent;
                        one remains free from acceptance and rejection. </p>

                        Thus-Gone One’s utterly pure wisdom vision. They are based in the infinite
                        pure gateways, are baseless, and manifest baselessly in the apprehending of
                        numerous phenomena. Anantavyūha, I have stated that ‘all phenomena are the
                        Buddha’s Dharma,’ which means that when there is realization of all
                        phenomena, it is called <distinct>the Buddha’s Dharma</distinct>. In other
                        words, these phenomena are the Buddha’s Dharma because the nature of all
                        phenomena has been realized to be equal through awakened wisdom. The
                        expression <distinct>comprehension of all phenomena</distinct> is used
                        because all phenomena must be realized, and the realization of all phenomena
                        is the realization of the dhāraṇī gateway because it subsumes all phenomena.
                        Anantavyūha, these dhāraṇīs are the condensation, the inclusion, the main
                        essence, and the heart of every explanation, praise,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-002-55"> In both occurrences in this line,

                        Anantavyūha, as an analogy, a mother must be present before a baby can be

                        the characteristic of phenomena to exist or remain within peace or
                        tranquility. All phenomena are immutable, and thus they cannot be defined as
                        anything. Since phenomena do not endure and thus cannot be counted, how

                        entire functioning of syllables is devoid of action, syllables, and effort.
                        Likewise, the workings of speech are also devoid of syllables and

                        refer to? These words are used because all phenomena of the earth element,
                        water element, fire element, wind element, space element, and consciousness

                        and formless realms—are immeasurable, beings are nonexistent, so they cannot
                        be apprehended or designated. Similarly, those realms are nonexistent, so
                        they cannot be apprehended or designated either. Therefore, all phenomena
                        are perfectly subsumed within the realm of nirvāṇa. The mode of the water
                        element shares the qualities of the realm of nirvāṇa, just as all phenomena
                        share the qualities of nirvāṇa. In this sense, all phenomena have the
                        distinction of being inexpressible. The realm of nirvāṇa is utterly devoid
                        of obscuration. Since the realm of nirvāṇa is purified of obscuration, it is
                        unobscured. The realm of nirvāṇa is pure and immaculate, and in this sense
                        the water element is not an element. Since elements are nonexistent, the
                        elements are expressed by demonstrating what transcends the elements.
                        Expressions are likewise not elements, and because they are not elements,
                        they do not come into being. Expressions are devoid of elements. Since all
                        phenomena are expressed by conventions, they are beyond expression. In that
                        way no act of expression can be apprehended or observed within them. All
                        expressions are non-expressions. In that sense, all expressions have the
                        identity of space—they are perfectly subsumed within space.</p>

                        element is similar to the water element. The consciousness element is not
                        categorized as an element; it is not comprised of elements and arises out of
                        space. The consciousness element is therefore categorized as space. The
                        consciousness element cannot be apprehended internally, externally, or

                        phenomena is equal and similar to space, and yet phenomena are completely
                        beyond expanse and non-expanse. All things are like open space, and so the
                        Thus-Gone One has stated, ‘All phenomena are like space.’ Since their
                        measurements cannot be apprehended, they are inherently equal and similar to

                        which, surrounded by stars, is so bright and resplendent. In a similar way,

                        of concepts as one gains both definitive understanding through the proper
                        investigation of these teachings and a pure acceptance of the realization

                        awakening. They should always wear them, teach on them, recite them, write
                        them out, and expound on their meaning. They should not be secretive with
                        this Dharma gateway but be liberal in discussing it, just as they have
