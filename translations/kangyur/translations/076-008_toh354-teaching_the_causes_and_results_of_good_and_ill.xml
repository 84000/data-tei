                    cause and effect. The discussion begins with Ānanda, who asks the Buddha why beings—particularly
                    human beings—undergo such a wide range of experiences. The Buddha replies that one’s past actions,
                    whether good or ill, bring about a variety of positive and negative experiences. To this effect, he
                    offers numerous vivid examples in which results in this current lifetime parallel actions from a
                    past life. Emphasis is placed on the object of one’s actions, such as the Saṅgha or the Three
                    Jewels. The discourse concludes with the Buddha describing the benefits associated with the sūtra
                    and listing its alternative titles, while the surrounding audience reaps a host of miraculous
                    benefits.</p>

                        asks the Buddha why different beings experience different fortunes and what types of past
                        actions have now ripened into their respective conditions. The Buddha answers by elucidating the
                        inconceivable dynamics of karma through a series of examples of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions
                        along with their positive and negative results. While these one-to-one correspondences might
                        strike the reader as an oversimplification of a very subtle and complex process, such pedagogical devices are common
                        in the Buddhist tradition. Notably, in the classical presentation of the three types of karmic
                        results (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">las kyi ’bras bu gsum</foreign>), the
                        second is said to be the “correlated effect” (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rgyu

                        about this Tibetan sūtra is that it is practically identical to another Tibetan translation,

                        simply different translations of the same Chinese sūtra. However, perhaps solely on account of
                        their dissimilar titles, they are retained as two distinct yet adjacent entries in the Degé

                    <p tid="12">These two sūtras differ not in terms of content but in terms of language; Toh 354,
                        translated here, employs an Indo-Tibetan lexicon, whereas Toh 355 uses a Sino-Tibetan
                            lexicon.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-008-9"> Scherrer-Schaub 2002, Stein
                            2010.</note> The Indo-Tibetan lexicon refers to a body of terminology constructed in the likeness of Sanskrit and implemented during the early ninth century in order to imbue
                        translations with a more Indic flavor, while the Sino-Tibetan lexicon leans toward a more
                        indigenous, and presumably more archaic, range of Tibetan terminology that emerged out of
                        interaction with Chinese texts.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-008-10"> As an example, the
                            word for merit is translated in Toh 355 as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">legs pa’i don</foreign>, instead of the more common <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bsod nams</foreign>, as per Indic vocabulary.</note> This suggests that Toh
                        355 is the earlier of the two translations, given that the Sino-Tibetan encounter predates the cultural sway that Indian Buddhism would later have over the Tibetan empire and
                        subsequent Tibetan Buddhist traditions.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-008-11"> Jonathan
                            Silk notes that some scholars support the possibility that Toh 355 is earlier, having been
                            produced by the translator Chim Sākya Ö (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mchims shA kya

                    <p tid="13">The translator of Toh 354 was the prolific translator Chödrup (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">chos grub</foreign>, alias Facheng <foreign xml:lang="zh">法成</foreign>, c.
                        755–849), who was active in Dunhuang during the early ninth century. Given that Chödrup is known
                        for his use of Indian vocabulary, it is likely that he did not also translate Toh 355. The
                        colophon of Toh 354 states that it was translated with reference to both Indian and Chinese
                        manuscripts. However, given that we have no extant Sanskrit manuscripts of the sūtra, no mention
                        of the text in Indian sources, and not even a Sanskrit title at the head of the sūtra, it seems
                        uncertain whether this statement can be trusted. It could possibly be a later addition made with
                        the aim of conferring greater canonical authenticity upon a translation from Chinese in a climate
                        in which India was seen as the principal source of authentic transmission. </p>

                                inability to engage in normative sexual behavior. The criteria for being designated a
                                paṇḍaka are not strictly physiological, but neither are they grounded exclusively in
                                gender identity or sexual orientation. Paṇḍaka is, in effect, a catchall category and,
