                    He relates the prayer to the Buddha, and a number of deities then vow to protect it and its adherents. The ruler’s devotion to the
                    sūtra is emphasized as important if the nation is to benefit. Toward the end of the sūtra are two well-known narratives of the
                    Buddha’s previous lives: the account of the physician Jalavāhana, who saves and blesses numerous fish, and that of Prince
                        <term>Mahāsattva</term>, who gives his body to a hungry tigress and her cubs.</p>

                        They describe how various divine beings in this world revere the sūtra and promise to protect it and its adherents. These
                        include the Four Mahārājas; Sthāvarā, who is the goddess of the earth; Sarasvatī, the goddess of wisdom, learning, and music;
                        Śrī, the goddess of good fortune, better known in the present time as Lakṣmī; and the yakṣa general Saṃjñeya. </p>

                        for its recitation and teaching, then their reign and their kingdom will prosper. They will avoid such calamities as invasion,
                        famine, and so on. The sūtra also warns that if they fail to show such devotion, there will be disastrous results for both
                        them and their kingdoms. Chapter 20 is dedicated to the subject of how to be a good king.</p>

                    <p tid="16">There are also chapters that deal with doctrine. Chapter 2 presents the view that a buddha never dies and so never
                        passes into nirvāṇa. Therefore, there is no body and no physical relics of his body after his cremation, and so the Dharma
                        never ceases to be taught. The passing of a buddha and the extinction of the Dharma are solely illusory manifestations,
                        skillful methods to inspire beings to practice and to provide them with relics as objects for their devotion. The longer
                        versions of the sūtra also contain chapter 3 (not present in Toh 557), which describes the nature of the three kāyas, and
                        chapter 6 (also not present in Toh 557), which describes the ten bodhisattva bhūmis. Chapters 9 and 10 teach the view of
                        emptiness. </p>

                        thousand fish into the paradise of Trāyastriṃśa. In the preceding chapter, these same ten thousand devas receive the prophecy
                        of their buddhahood. When the goddess of the Bodhi tree objects that they have not accomplished the necessary bodhisattva
                        conduct in past lives to receive such a prophecy, the Buddha explains that this was unnecessary because they had devotion to
                        this <title xml:lang="en">Sūtra of the Sublime Golden Light</title>.</p>

                    <p tid="18">The other past-life narrative, which is given in chapter 26, is one of the most famous in Buddhist literature—that of
                        the prince who gives his body to a hungry tigress and her cubs. An interesting feature of the story in this sūtra is that much
                        of the narrative is dedicated to an evocative description of the intense grief of parents who have lost their child,
                        emphasizing the sorrow that the prince’s action has brought them.</p>

                    <p tid="20">As with other late Mahāyāna sūtras in which there is an emphasis on ritual, this text is classified in the Kangyur as
                        a tantra, specifically as a Kriyā tantra, a class of tantras in which there is an emphasis on external ritual. The sūtra
                        contains a description of how such rituals should be performed, and there are also passages that include lists of ingredients
                        to place in a bath along with mantras to recite while bathing in order to achieve purification. This and the
                        twenty-nine-chapter version also supply a number of dhāraṇīs to be recited in order to gain specific results. </p>

                    <p tid="21">One can also see that the seed of the later maṇḍalas of the five buddha families is in this sūtra, for in chapters 2
                        and 3, buddhas of the four directions appear to a layman who has a visionary dream. They include Akṣobhya from the east and
                        Amitābha from the west, both buddhas and their realms already established in the Buddhist tradition with specific sūtras
                        dedicated to them. There also appear the buddhas Ratnaketu from the south and Dundubhisvara from the north, who in later
                        tantras are usually named Ratnasaṃbhava and Amoghasiddhi. In this sūtra, the central buddha in terms of these directions would
                        be Śākyamuni himself. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddhāvatamsaka Sūtra</title> he is referred to as Vairocana, as the
                        Buddha Vairocana is the buddha who manifests as all the buddhas throughout this trichiliocosm.</p>

                        first in Dunhuang. Then in 420 he went to Guzang, the capital of Northern Liang, one of the sixteen independent states of that

                        the patronage of Juqu Mengxun (368–433), the ruler of Northern Liang. He also had the reputation of being “a master of
                        spells,” and as a result of that reputation, toward the end of his reign, Juqu Mengxun became afraid that Dharmakṣema might be

                        from it) has a preface that states how the sūtra saved Zhang Judao, ruler of Tangut, from going to hell because he had

                        throughout, even though the content is essentially the same. There are many passages that are actually shorter versions of
                        those in the translations from Sanskrit. Its greater length compared to the twenty-nine-chapter version (Toh 556) is primarily
                        due to the addition of two chapters (29 and 30).</p>

                            states that he was at that time Susaṃbhava, and that Built of Jewels became the Buddha Akṣobhya. He further states that it

                            the ten thousand fish in it were in danger of dying. A tree goddess appeared who told Jalavāhana that he should save the

                            elephants from him, and used them to carry water to replenish the lake. He then sent his son Jalāmbara home to obtain as
                            much food as possible, and he used that to feed the fish. Finally, he waded into the lake and recited the Dharma of
                            dependent origination and the name of the Buddha Ratnaśikhin. At another time, he became intoxicated with alcohol at a
                            feast and afterward fell asleep. The ten thousand fish had died, and because of Jalavāhana’s recitation, they had been
                            reborn in the Trāyastriṃśa paradise. They came to the sleeping Jalavāhana and made offerings of many pearls and caused

                            asked Ānanda to prepare a seat at a particular spot, and when he stamped the ground with his foot, a stūpa emerged. Inside
                            were golden caskets containing bones. The Buddha tells the bhikṣus to pay homage to them, because these bones are from one
                            of his previous lives, and it was through the sacrifice of his life that he was able to attain buddhahood. He relates that
                            in the past, King Mahāratha had three sons, Mahāpraṇāda, Mahādeva, and <term>Mahāsattva</term>. The three princes wandered
                            into a forest and saw a tigress that had given birth to five cubs but was starving and might soon eat her cubs.
                                <term>Mahāsattva</term> decided to give his body to the tigress, and therefore, as they were leaving the forest, he
                            told his brothers he would follow them later and turned back. He then cut his throat in front of the tigress and fell
                            before her. The other two princes searched for their younger brother and discovered he had been eaten. The queen had
                            nightmares and was distressed, thinking that something had happened to her sons. The king and queen went in search of
                            their sons and found the two princes, who told them of <term>Mahāsattva</term>’s death. In great distress, they went to
                            his remains, gathered them up, and placed them in the stūpa. The Buddha states that he was <term>Mahāsattva</term>. The
                            story is then retold in verse, in which it is also stated that the Buddha’s father, Śuddhodana, was the king; his mother,
                            Māyā, was the queen; the two other princes were Maitreya and Mañjuśrī; the tigress was his stepmother, Mahāprajāpatī; and
