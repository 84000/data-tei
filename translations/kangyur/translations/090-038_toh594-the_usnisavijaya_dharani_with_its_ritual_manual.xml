            opens in Sukhāvatī, where the Blessed One Amitāyus is residing. Amitāyus addresses the
            bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, informing him that there are beings who suffer from
            illnesses and short lifespans, and introducing the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> dhāraṇī as a remedy for such painful circumstances.
            Avalokiteśvara immediately asks Amitāyus to pronounce the dhāraṇī, which the Tathāgata
            does from within a state of samādhi. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-7"/>
          <p tid="11">After he pronounces the dhāraṇī, Amitāyus addresses Śakra and explains that
            reciting it purifies all lower rebirths and obscurations and leads beings to higher
            rebirths. Amitāyus lists a number of lower births that will be avoided by someone who
            recites this dhāraṇī, as well as the various prominent families within the human realm
            into which the reciter will be born on their way to attaining the state of awakening. As
            he continues to elaborate upon the ways in which one can use the dhāraṇī to benefit
            beings, Amitāyus explains that it can be hung from the top of a flagstaff, a mountain,
            or a tall building so that those in the surrounding areas will be purified and prevented
            from taking lower rebirths. He also notes that it may be carved into wood, placed at a
            caitya, and worshiped. This inspires Yama, the Lord of Death, to pledge to Amitāyus to
            protect beings who recite the dhāraṇī. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-8"/>
          <p tid="12">The Four Great Kings then request instructions on the rites associated with
            the dhāraṇī, and Amitāyus proceeds to teach a number of rites, including ways the
            dhāraṇī can be used to benefit the dead, animals, and those who are ill, as well as to
            prevent lower rebirths and extend life. These rituals involve the preparation of a
            maṇḍala in which the dhāraṇī is installed, making various offerings, the construction of
            caityas, and hundreds, thousands, or even a hundred thousand recitations of the dhāraṇī.
            In some cases the rituals involve fasting or performing the ritual at specific times of
            the lunar month. Śakra is instructed to teach one of these rites to the god
            Supratiṣṭhita to extend his life, which he does, and the god is delighted with the
            results. Finally, Amitāyus teaches his own dhāraṇī along with its related sādhana and
            fire offering rite, along with a number of additional applications of the dhāraṇī to
            obtain results such as glory and kingship.</p>

            ritual manuals connected with the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> dhāraṇī, this text shares a number of parallel passages with

              incomplete, probably due to the loss of a folio, the manuscript lacks several passages

              are absent in that translation, including two passages that <emph>are</emph> found in
              the present work. Nonetheless, the Sanskrit manuscript is by and large the same work
              that is translated into Tibetan as Toh 597. More recently, the Sanskrit of the very
              same manuscript was studied by Gudrun Meltzer in a 2007 “limited distribution report”

              indeed translations of the same Sanskrit work and contain identical material apart
              from the Chinese translation’s inclusion of a single, very short passage about a

            complex one that cannot be clearly answered here. In short, like a number of uṣṇīṣa
            deities, she is sometimes identified as a protective deity, in this case a goddess,
            emanated from the Buddha’s uṣṇīṣa. Indeed,
            Uṣṇīṣavijayā is clearly depicted as a goddess in a number of short sādhanas
            included in Indian anthologies such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sādhanamāla</title>,
            compiled from the works of many authors probably during the period of the

            Three closely similar sādhanas of a three-faced, eight armed form of the goddess are included in the 
            Tengyur, one in each of the three related anthologies translated from the Indian collections into Tibetan in the eleventh to fourteenth centuries 
            respectively.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-274">The three are Toh 3377, 3248, and 3580, translated respectively by

              Patshap Lotsāwa Tsültrim Gyaltsen (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">pa tshab lo tsA ba tshul khrims rgyal mtshan</foreign>, twelfth century), and

            In the later Tibetan tradition Uṣṇīṣavijayā
            can even appear as one of a group of three
            long-life deities along with the Buddha Amitāyus and White Tārā. However, in our Kangyur text,
            and indeed in all but one (Toh 598) of the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> works in this section of the Kangyur, while the
            dhāraṇī itself uses the feminine vocative form throughout, the name <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> is not rendered into Tibetan in
            the feminine, and the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign>
            is not used to refer to anything apart from the name of the dhāraṇī—the dhāraṇī of
              <distinct>the crown victory</distinct>. The single instance in this text in which we
            could interpret <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign> to refer
            to a goddess is a sentence in one of the rites for an Amitāyus sādhana that also
            involves reciting the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uṣṇīṣavijayā</foreign>
            dhāraṇī. After having properly followed the rite, the text notes that “in the early
            morning at dawn you will see the face of the Bhagavatī, and she will give you whatever
            accomplishments you desire.” The name of this Bhagavatī is not mentioned in our text,
            but we might well presume that she is Uṣṇīṣavijayā herself. </p>

          <p tid="107">The range of possible answers to the question of what the name Uṣṇīṣavijayā refers to is enlarged even further by
            the existence of a group of related texts widely used in Southeast Asia, sharing the Pali 
            title <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Uṇhissa-vijaya-sutta</title> (or in some cases 
            simply <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Uṇhissa-vijaya</title>) but found in a 
            number of different forms, some in Pali but others in Siamese, Lao, Yuon, and Khmer. 
            Some refer at least briefly to the story of the 
            god Supratiṣṭhita (Pali Supatiṭṭhita) which, though somewhat secondary in the present text, is the central frame story of Toh 597. But instead of the dhāraṇī of the Sanskrit
            and Tibetan texts they contain a set of verses (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gāthā</foreign>) 
            to be recited whose content is unrelated to that of the Sanskrit dhāraṇī. The 
            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gāthā</foreign> are also found alone in several
            ritual compilations. Even in the vernacular versions, 
            the verses are written in Pali. In these texts, in their own opening lines, it seems to be the verses themselves that
            are referred to as the Uṇhissa-vijaya.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-277">These 
              Southeast Asian texts are not included in the official Pali Canon of the Theravāda tradition and are

              for extending life and in funeral rites. Whether they reflect the diffusion
              of texts and practices directly from India prior to the relatively recent evolution
              of Theravāda orthodoxy, or were transmitted via Chinese along with Chinese migrations
              and cultural influence in the region, remains an open question. For

              later canons as Toh 597 by its full title in that catalog: the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sarva­durgati­pariśodhana-uṣṇīṣavijayā-dhāraṇī</title> (Lalou

            its presence in the Phangthangma catalog at the very least indicates the early presence
            of parts of the Uṣṇīṣavijayā corpus, including not just the dhāraṇī but also some of its
            associated rites, in Tibet. </p>

              and the Dhāraṇī Collection sections of the Kangyurs, the texts in the genre of

            title and colophon and only minor variants. We also consulted the Sanskrit from
            Schopen’s transcription of the “Los Angeles Manuscript” of the primary dhāraṇī text and
            Hidas’ edition and translation of the surviving Sanskrit <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Uṣṇīṣavijayā-dhāraṇī</title> text for the passages that are parallel with the present

          <p tid="104">The main dhāraṇī is not identical in every detail across the five different
            versions in the Degé Kangyur (Toh 594–598), and the existence of further variations
            across different Kangyurs and versions in extra-canonical collections further
            complicates the picture. Reference to the dhāraṇī as presented in Hidas’ edition of the
            Sanskrit yields useful orthographic confirmation, but may be misleading as a model given
            that the ten different Nepalese Sanskrit manuscripts on which it is based are of much
            later date than any of the present Tibetan witnesses. Here and in the other works in the
            group we have therefore chosen to transcribe the dhāraṇī as it appears in the Degé
            version of each text, making only minor choices of orthography and adding annotations to
            point out the most significant discrepancies.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-271"/>
          <p tid="105">One noticeable difference across both Tibetan and Sanskrit versions of the dhāraṇī is
            the presence or absence of the syllable <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign> at the beginning of certain phrases. In the
            present work and Toh 595, 596, and 597 there are only three such <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign> syllables, while in
            Toh 598 <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign> appears no less than nine times, as it does in Hidas’ edition from Sanskrit
            sources and in extra-canonical liturgies. The Tibetan translation of Toh 598 was made at
            a significantly later date than the other works of the group, and may possibly signal a
            change in usage that is also reflected in the Nepalese Sanskrit texts of even later
            date. This is corroborated by the absence of extra <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s in the Dunhuang manuscripts. The
            colophon of Toh 597 found in the Phukdrak (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">phug brag</foreign>) Kangyur includes a note claiming
            that the texts with only three <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s are to be considered more correct.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-262">The text is F 631, Phukdrak Kangyur, vol. 117 (rgyud, dza), F.224.a–231.a. It should
              be noted, however, that the version of the dhāraṇī preserved in F 631 differs from the
              dhāraṇī in the present text much more substantially than any of the versions in the
              mainstream Kangyurs.</note> The note also states that although there may have
            been Sanskrit sources with as many as nine <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s, the twelfth-century translator Sumpa
              Lotsāwa<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-090-038-263">Probably Sumpa Lotsāwa Dharma Yontan (sum pa lo tsA ba dhar
              ma yon tan), a translator and teacher of Sakya Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen, but possibly
              his uncle, also called Sumpa Lotsāwa, Palchok Dangpö Dorje (dpal mchog dang po’i rdor
              rje). Both studied in Nepal. See <ref target="https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Sumpa-Lotsawa-Darma-Yonten/1726">Treasury of Lives</ref>.</note> reported that all the Sanskrit texts he had seen
            contained only three, and that the Sanskrit manuscripts of the texts held at Sakya
            monastery had no more than that. Because Sumpa Lotsāwa is known to have lived and
            studied in Nepal, his comment on the “correct” number of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s in the Sanskrit
            manuscripts available to him offers a glimpse of the evolution of the text in the
            Nepalese tradition. As Hidas’ edition of the Nepalese manuscripts suggests, the number
            of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">oṁ</foreign>-s in the dhāraṇī seem to proliferate, eventually reaching a total of nine.</p>

            portion of it with remarkable fidelity. Nevertheless, the few anomalies to be seen
            across all these closely related texts are a reminder that here, as with other dhāraṇī

              in bold has been incongruously lifted from its proper place several lines down in the
              text and added here. The Sanskrit passage lacks this error but also includes several
              additional words absent in the Tibetan. However, as the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts are
              not identical in other places in this parallel passage either, and since the Tibetan
              text makes perfect sense without these additional elements, we have not taken the
              liberty of adding them in the English translation. The Sanskrit passage, in Hidas’
