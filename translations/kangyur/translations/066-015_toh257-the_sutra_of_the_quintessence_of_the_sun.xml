            According to the colophon of the Tibetan translation, the sūtra was translated into
            Tibetan by the Indian scholars Sarvajñādeva, Vidyākaraprabha, and Dharmākara and by the
            Tibetan translator Zangkyong. It was then edited and finalized by Kawa Paltsek, the
            prolific translator who participated in numerous translation projects in Tibet during
            the early translation period, when the majority of Indian sūtras were translated into
            Tibetan. In producing this English rendering, we have based our work on the Tibetan Degé

            is included in the Mahāsannipāta (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’dus pa chen

            can be understood to refer to both this great collection of sūtras and the great
            assembly of monks and bodhisattvas present around the Buddha when those teachings were
              given.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-19">Braarvig 1993, p. xxv.</note> The
            Mahāsannipāta, preserved in its entirety in the Chinese canon, is a group of rather
            loosely related texts. Although these texts vary in terms of doctrine and form, they do
            show greater homogeneity than other scriptural collections such as the Ratnakūṭa.
            Braarvig argues that the first twelve sūtras in this collection must have been part of
            the original Indic versions<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-20">Notably, the
              Mahāsannipāta collection is mentioned in the sūtras themselves, and the introductions
              of those texts are almost identical (Braarvig 1993, pp. xxxix–xl).</note> and that the
            collection as a whole probably existed before the individual scriptures found among
            Sanskrit manuscripts and in the Tibetan canon. A few sūtras of the Mahāsannipāta are
            indeed available in Sanskrit (mostly in fragmentary forms) and in Tibetan, but only as
            independent texts. It appears that this collection did not receive the same level of
            attention in India as other large collections like the Ratnakūṭa and the
            Buddhāvataṃsaka. On the other hand, it is obvious that the Mahāsannipāta played an
            important role in some of the Chinese and Central Asian kingdoms along the Silk Road. It
            is, for example, praised in <title xml:lang="en">The Book of Zambasta</title>, an
            important Khotanese Buddhist poem from the eighth century, along with the Prajñāpāramitā
            and the Buddhāvataṃsaka. According to Braarvig, the Chinese translation of the
            Mahāsannipāta was initially compiled during the second or third century, at the earliest
            during the first. The collection that is extant today (Taishō 397) was compiled in 586
              <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> by the Khotanese monk Sengjiu. This collection is based
            on the manuscript of the translation of the first sūtras by Dharmarakṣema (414–21 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>) and was enlarged by new texts translated by Narendrayaśas,
            including <title xml:lang="en">The Quintessence of the Sun</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-21">Braarvig 1993, pp. xxxiii–xxxvii.</note>

          <p tid="15">There is some evidence suggesting that this sūtra, or at least parts of it,
            may have been composed in Central Asia.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-23">
              Several scholars support this hypothesis. For example, Braarvig (1993, p. xxxvi)
              mentions that some of the passages of <title xml:lang="en">The Quintessence of the
                Sun</title> suggest a Central Asian origin, and Dan Martin (2001, p. 38) speaks of
              texts translated into Chinese by Narendrayaśas that belong to the Mahāsannipāta
              section of the Kangyur but may never have existed in an Indian language. See also
              Demiéville (1973, p. 196) and Nakamura (1980, p. 216) for Japanese literary references
              on the subject.</note> Its last chapter contains a list of twenty sacred sites blessed
            by the presence of holy beings. Less than half of the sites mentioned in this chapter
            are located in India, and many are Central Asian. This geographical list clearly
            reflects the propagation of Buddhism from India to China along the route of the
            pilgrims. The sacred location given the most attention in this text is situated in the
            land of Khaṣa, another name for the site of what would become the city-state of Khotan,
            which existed during the first millennium <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. According to
            Lévi, <title xml:lang="en">The Quintessence of the Sun</title> is one of the sūtras most
            intimately connected with that region, and he holds the view that Khotan was one of the
            most active centers for the compilation of Mahāyāna literature, especially of sūtras

            and indescribable number of bodhisattva great beings who had arrived from countless

            innumerable, limitless, and indescribable number of great hearers who had gathered there
            from different buddha realms of the ten directions. In the same way, an innumerable,
            limitless, and indescribable number of other beings who had arrived there from the
            various buddha realms of the ten directions—Śakra, Lord Brahmā, the rulers of the gods,
            the rulers of the nāgas, the rulers of the yakṣas, the rulers of the gandharvas, the
            rulers of the asuras, the rulers of the garuḍas, the rulers of the kinnaras, and the
            rulers of the mahoragas—filled all the pathways on the ground and in the sky throughout
            the entire buddha realm of Sahā. There also arrived an innumerable and limitless number
            of different gods from the desire and form realms, of nāgas, yakṣas, and rākṣasas, and
            of asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas. Sitting in silence, they looked up at the
            Blessed One as he revealed how bodhisattva conduct quickly brings perfection and
            manifests like space and as he gave teachings on the mindfulness of breathing, which is
            the gateway to immortality, and the sublime states. <ref cRef="F.92.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-33"/> They filled all the pathways on the ground and in the

            of light, or like beings carried off by a river looking at the riverbank, or like

            nonregression, and who are experts in unobstructed wisdom—come to this buddha realm of
            Sahā! Once they have assembled here, may they employ their individual virtuous qualities
            and concentrations so that in this buddha realm this great earth may become highly
            favorable and nourishing and so that beings may be endowed with qualities, recall,

            appropriate virtuous qualities, and this is why light is now radiating from the bodies
            of some of those meditators, as if from oil lamps. From the bodies of some of the others
            radiate light rays like the light emitted by many hundreds of thousands of suns and

            who revel in the higher perceptions, and who have trained in concentration can be
            overpowered by women in an instant. Through the faults of women, all their roots of

            vanish and become nonexistent. They will clearly understand the many defects of saṃsāra,

            properly. How should they do so? Concerning the sense faculties alone, <ref cRef="F.173.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-601"/> they should investigate
            their eyes while sitting cross-legged on their various seats with all their faculties
            restrained. They should think, ‘My right eye is made of the four great elements. It is
            connected with ligaments and filled with water. Only the winds control its movements.
            When they enter the eye faculty, the winds cause the eye to roll and move. Those winds
            that control the eye and produce its manifestations are in turn supported by space.
            Space is inapprehensible—it is inexpressible and selfless. Just as space is selfless, so
            too are the winds. Those winds that enter the eye faculty, make it roll, control its
            movements, control it, and produce its manifestations are also inapprehensible,

            feeling, the strong attachment of craving, appropriation, becoming, birth, and old age
            and death. Therefore, all these phenomena are dependent upon the eye consciousness. The

            empty of <distinct>I</distinct> and <distinct>mine</distinct>. Why is it so? Because
            such is the nature of the eye. Since it does not remain eternally, and since it is

            those conditions, and those are therefore also selfless. That which is selfless is empty

            All phenomena have the nature of arising and disintegrating, and they are devoid of

            concentration, and it is bathed in a brilliant light that has never been seen or heard

            besides this buddha realm and its outer mountain range, nothing else whatsoever appears.
            Respected Blessed One, if this entire buddha realm of Sahā is perceived due to the light
            of those bodhisattva great beings, what would the light emitted by the thus-gone ones

            the outcome of their previous bodhisattva activity. The thus-gone ones’ manifestations
            are blessed by the domain of nonattachment; they possess the intelligence that engages

            an innumerable and limitless number of universes in all the ten directions. In the same

            summit of existence appeared within the body of the Thus-Gone One. The entire buddha
            realm of Sahā appeared within the body of the Thus-Gone One. All the afflictions related
            to the physical and mental suffering of all the sentient beings present in this buddha
            realm of Sahā—the hell beings, the animals, those in the World of the Lord of Death, the

            mental well-being similar to that experienced by the monks who have entered into
            absorption and reached the tranquility of the second concentration. All the bodhisattvas
            then arose from their absorptions, and the light was dimmed within their bodies. All the
            hearers and sentient beings who had entered into absorption likewise arose from their

            their senses satisfied, they sat within the body of the Thus-Gone One and looked at the

            generosity and give freely. Through the power of their aspirations, they will be born

            their aspirations. (3) There are sentient beings who pursue the unsurpassed vehicle but
            are filled with intense pride. Due to the power of this pride, they will be born among
            the nāgas through their aspirations. (4) There are sentient beings who exert themselves
            in the conduct of the unsurpassed vehicle but have a lot of aggression in them and are
            extremely hostile toward others. Due to the feelings of enmity they entertain, they will
            form the wish to be born among the nāgas just before they die. They will thus be born
            there through their aspirations. (5) There are sentient beings who genuinely follow the

            gifts, and are endowed with an attitude of worship. They may also be born among the
            nāgas through their own aspirations. (6) There are sentient beings who possess the
            defects of miserliness and pride. They will be born among the nāgas through their
            actions. (7) There are sentient beings who delight in pride, talk nonsense, and lie.

            induced by inferior actions of body, speech, and mind, they will be born among the
            nāgas. (9) There are sentient beings who, overwhelmed by pride and ignorance, lack
            control and do not behave faultlessly. They will be born among the nāgas. (10) Finally,
            there are sentient beings who are proud and who are used to slander and to speaking with

            gifts, reveled in the concentrations, and wished for the unsurpassed vehicle resided in
            that place. At that time, humans craved food. For the sake of food, they accused the
            sages of engaging in sexual intercourse and threw dust and ashes at them. Hence, the
            sages eventually left the country Rough Stone. When they saw that the sages had left,
            those beings rejoiced and were overjoyed. Do you remember how furious you became, and
            how you deprived them of their water by drying out the rivers, streams, lakes, ponds,
            springs, and wells in their country? In that land, the fire god also became angry and
            extinguished the fires of those beings, leaving them tormented by hunger and thirst.

              <ref cRef="F.242.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-066-015-1172"/> Analysis is what
            causes the movement of the winds of inhalation and exhalation throughout the entire body
            with either aspect of cold or warmth. Analysis does not cognize contact and touch.
            Analysis and the winds are not each other’s domains. Both are mutually free of

          <p tid="843">“What are the mental formations? The mental formations are perception and
            intention. What is perception? It is the mind that understands phenomena to be a certain
            way. [. . .] At the time of inhalation, there is no exhalation. In this way perception
            becomes accustomed to formations. After they arise, the formations are exhausted. By
            perceiving them accordingly, the perception of formations is cultivated. This is what is
            meant by ‘perception.’ Perception is based on the winds, [. . .] and both are
            inexpressible. What is intention? Through intentions, [. . .] perception becomes
            accustomed to formations, one enters into faultless reality, and one transcends the
            level of ordinary beings. Becoming accustomed to birth and disintegration clears away
            formations from the mind so that the winds are no longer stirred. This is what is meant
            by ‘intention.’ Since the three types of feelings are abandoned, one comes to possess
            the support of wisdom—the unadulterated eye [. . .] and the unadulterated mind—and one
            becomes a noble one. </p>

              <term type="definition">Paltsek, from the village of Kawa north of Lhasa, was one of
                Tibet’s preeminent translators. He was one of the first seven Tibetans to be
                ordained by Śāntarakṣita and is counted by the later tradition as one of Guru
                Rinpoche’s twenty-five close disciples. In a <term type="ignore">famous</term> verse
                by Ngok Lotsawa, Paltsek is named along with Chokro Lui Gyaltsen and Zhang Nanam
                Yeshé as part of a group of translators whose skills were surpassed only by
                Vairocana. He translated works from a wide variety of genres, including sūtra,
                śāstra, vinaya, and tantra, and was an author himself. Paltsek was also one of the
                most important editors of the early period, one of nine translators installed by
                Trisong Detsen to supervise the translation of the Tripiṭaka and help catalog
                translated works for the first two of three imperial catalogs (the <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan kar ma</title> and <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bsam yas mchims
