                                        immersed in meditation, Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world,
                                        appears before him and asks him how bodhisattvas can quickly
                                        achieve full awakening. In response, the Buddha gives a
                                        teaching on mindfulness of the body. The following morning,
                                        when Brahmā has departed, the Buddha relays his teaching to
                                        the monks.</p>

                                        <p tid="9">In the middle of the night at Kūṭāgāraśālā, the
                                                monastery in the great forest grove near Vaiśālī,
                                                the Buddha is seated cross-legged, engaged in a
                                                progression of the four concentrations—proceeding
                                                through them forward and then backward—at the end of
                                                which he enters a meditative absorption which makes
                                                his whole body radiant. Far away in the brahmā
                                                heavens of the form realm, the great god Brahmā sees
                                                the Buddha’s radiance and leaves his heaven in order
                                                to ask him a question. Arriving there in an instant,
                                                he politely rouses the Buddha from his absorption
                                                with gentle verses of praise and then proceeds to
                                                ask his question. The arrival of Brahmā is
                                                especially noteworthy, considering that according to
                                                Buddhist literature, it was Brahmā who first
                                                beseeched the reluctant Buddha to teach, just after
                                                the latter had gained awakening.</p>

                                        <p tid="10">Brahmā’s question on this occasion is simple:
                                                how many dharmas, or qualities, do bodhisattvas need
                                                in order to quickly reach the complete awakening of
                                                a buddha? The Bhagavān’s reply is surprising: one
                                                needs only one dharma and that dharma is mindfulness
                                                of the body. </p>

                                        <p tid="11">Mindfulness of the body is the first of the four
                                                applications of mindfulness recognized throughout
                                                Buddhist literature—mindfulness concerning the body,
                                                mindfulness concerning feelings, mindfulness
                                                concerning the mind, and mindfulness concerning the
                                                nature of phenomena. In this discourse, it is the
                                                first of these that takes precedence, though
                                                mindfulness concerning the mind and mindfulness
                                                concerning phenomena are also addressed
                                                sequentially.</p>

                                        <p tid="12">First, he speaks of mindfulness of the body in
                                                terms of being present and aware in undertaking
                                                daily activities like sitting, walking, lying down,
                                                and so on. He then explains mindfulness in terms of
                                                reflection on the transience and essencelessness of
                                                the physical body, which is prone to disease and
                                                illness, and will ultimately be reduced to something
                                                disgusting. Such reflection loosens attachment to
                                                the physical body, and being without attachment to
                                                the physical body and its trappings means living a
                                                materially simple life.</p>
                                        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-059-001-65"/>
                                        <p tid="13">This leads to a presentation of mindfulness in
                                                terms of avoiding unvirtuous or unwholesome
                                                activities. In particular, these are the first three
                                                precepts: not killing, not taking what is not given,
                                                and avoiding lust. This section on maintaining a
                                                strict discipline is, however, softened by the
                                                proviso that the body also needs to be nurtured,
                                                since without a body a bodhisattva is unable to make
                                                use of the opportunities that this life affords.</p>

                                        <p tid="14">The Buddha then explains how the six perfections
                                                may be used as antidotes to counter the mind’s
                                                natural tendencies toward negative mental states.
                                                The tendency to miserliness is countered by
                                                generosity, the tendency toward immorality by
                                                discipline, the tendency toward ill will by
                                                forbearance, the tendency toward indolence by
                                                effort, the tendency to distraction by
                                                concentration, and the tendency to incorrect
                                                understanding by wisdom. Particular attention is
                                                paid to the final two. The instruction on
                                                concentration, for example, includes a condensed
                                                account of how bodhisattvas use meditation focused
                                                on an object to stabilize the mind, and once it is
                                                stable, proceed to looking for the mind, and to
                                                objectless meditative equipoise. A further
                                                contemplation is offered in which one examines
                                                letters and words as a way of seeing the
                                                “hollowness” of phenomena, and through this, of
                                                experiencing all conditioned phenomena as dreamlike.
                                                In the scheme of the four applications of
                                                mindfulness, these reflections would correspond to
                                                the third and fourth applications of mindfulness
                                                concerning the mind and phenomena, respectively. </p>

                                                a contemplation in which the elements that make up
                                                our bodies—earth, water, fire, and wind—are analyzed

                                                the body? Brahmā, it is like this; when bodhisattvas
                                                think ‘I am going,’ they are mindful that they are

                                                coming back, and they recognize what they are doing
                                                exactly. When they lie down, stand, walk, or sit,

                                                complete Buddha, regarding a certain point.’ Monks,
                                                this was his request, and I replied to Brahmā, lord
                                                of the Sahā world, ‘Brahmā, the Tathāgata always
                                                has time to grant you a teaching. Brahmā, ask the

                                                a teaching that will delight you.’ Granted this
                                                opportunity, Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, asked

                                                truly complete awakening of buddhahood?’ I replied
                                                to Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, ‘Brahmā, if
                                                bodhisattva mahāsattvas have just one dharma, they
                                                will quickly reach the unsurpassable, truly complete
                                                awakening of buddhahood. What is that one dharma? It
                                                is mindfulness that observes the body.’ Then, monks,
                                                I taught Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, the causes,

                                                Bhagavān, even if Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world,

                                                  Brahmā, who presides over our Sahā world. Though
                                                  not considered a creator god in Buddhism, Brahmā
                                                  occupies an important place as one of two gods
                                                  (the other being Indra/Śakra) said to have first
                                                  exhorted the Buddha Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma.
                                                  The particular heavens of the form realm over
                                                  which Brahmā rules are among the most sought-after
                                                  realms of higher rebirth in Buddhist literature.
                                                  Sahā is the name of the particular world system or
                                                  trichiliocosm, in which our four-continent world
                                                  is located. It is also the buddhafield of the
                                                  Buddha Śākyamuni. Since there are many universes
                                                  or world systems, there are also multiple supreme
                                                  Brahmās presiding over them.</p>
