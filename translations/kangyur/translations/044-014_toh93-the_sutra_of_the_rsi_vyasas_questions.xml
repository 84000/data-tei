                                        non-Buddhist mendicant, approaches the Buddha with a large
                                        group of followers to inquire about the karmic results of
                                        giving. Some of the key points taught in this sūtra are the
                                        merit and karmic results of giving and the distinction
                                        between pure and impure giving. A final long passage
                                        describes the life in the god realms that is experienced as
                                        the fruit of powerful acts of giving, and it explains the
                                        signs received by gods of their own impending death and
                                        subsequent human birth.</p>

                                                mendicant followers, approaches the Buddha and poses
                                                a few questions about the karmic results of giving.
                                                Some of the key points taught in this sūtra are the
                                                merit and karmic results of giving and the
                                                distinction between pure and impure giving. A final
                                                long passage describes the life in the god realms
                                                that is experienced as the fruit of powerful acts of
                                                giving, and it explains the signs received by gods
                                                of their own impending death and subsequent human
                                                rebirth.</p>

                                                have entered absorption, gained insight, gained
                                                liberation, and possess the view of wisdom that
                                                leads to liberation, it is a great gift. If one
                                                offers protection to beings who have taken rebirth
                                                in the animal realm such as crows, owls, and deer,
                                                it is a great gift. If it fulfills someone’s wish
                                                for something they need or do not possess, it is a
                                                great gift. Those are pure gifts and great gifts,
                                                Great Seer, and since these gifts are accepted as
                                                pure, that is how you should cultivate pure giving.
