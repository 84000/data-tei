                                        non-Buddhist mendicant, approaches the Buddha with a large
                                        group of followers to inquire about the karmic results of
                                        giving. Some of the key points taught in this sūtra are such karmic results and the distinction between pure and impure giving. A final long passage
                                        describes the life in the god realms that is experienced as
                                        the fruit of particular acts of giving, and it explains the
                                        signs received by gods of their own impending death and
                                        subsequent human birth.</p>

                                                mendicant whose name literally means “compiler.” The

                                                Hindu traditions, the best known of whom bears the

                                                mendicant followers, approaches the Buddha and poses
                                                a few questions about the karmic results of giving.
                                                Some of the key points taught in this sūtra are the
                                                merit and karmic results of giving and the
                                                distinction between pure and impure giving. A final
                                                long passage describes the life in the god realms
                                                that is experienced as the fruit of powerful acts of
                                                giving, and it explains the signs received by gods
                                                of their own impending death and subsequent human
                                                rebirth.</p>

                                                consequences of making offerings to a blessed one
                                                who has passed into parinirvāṇa and one who is
                                                currently alive are the same. Why is that? Because
                                                the form bodies of the tathāgatas are issued forth
                                                from the truth body, but the truth body is not
                                                issued forth from the form body. Since the intention is the same whether someone makes offerings to me when I am present or after my parinirvāṇa, there is not
                                                even the slightest difference in the merit these two accrue. </p>

                                                again and again; many defilements, injuries, and
                                                sicknesses may befall that household for the period

                                                or it might kill her while it is in her womb. Great
                                                Seer, that is how one can see that the being is
                                                inclined toward nonmeritorious action.” </p>

                                                lives, and as it remembers them, it rejoices. It
                                                comes to know things such as ‘this was my mother for

                                                without developing attachment to that mother. It
                                                gives rise to freedom from desire, thinking, ‘Alas,
