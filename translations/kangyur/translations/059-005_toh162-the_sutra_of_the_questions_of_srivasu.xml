                    <p tid="7">In <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Śrīvasu</title>, the Buddha is approached by a young merchant named Śrīvasu,
                        who requests instruction on how to live his life as a novice bodhisattva. Delighted by this request, the Buddha offers some pithy
                        advice regarding the bodhisattva path that neatly summarizes the principal altruistic aims and practices of the Great Vehicle.
                        Beginning with venerating the Three Jewels and rejoicing in their awakened activities, the beginner bodhisattva is advised to
                        cultivate the mind of awakening, i.e., the resolve to attain awakening for the sake of all beings, which is the basis of all
                        Great Vehicle practice. With this altruistic outlook, the Buddha tells Śrīvasu, the aspiring bodhisattva should engage in all
                        the virtuous activities prescribed within the framework of the six perfections and other disciplines central to the Great
                        Vehicle. These cause all wholesome states of mind to blossom in the bodhisattva, and all negative thoughts to wither, bringing
                        the bodhisattva ever closer to the realization of awakening. At the conclusion of the teaching, we learn that the audience
                        has included a prince, the son of a certain King Sindhugiri of Darada, an ancient kingdom in the Gilgit region of larger Kashmir.
                        The prince, who is not named, is so moved by the teaching that he goes before the Buddha and expresses his aspiration to
                        attain awakening, while vowing to henceforth live by the principles that the Buddha has outlined.</p>
