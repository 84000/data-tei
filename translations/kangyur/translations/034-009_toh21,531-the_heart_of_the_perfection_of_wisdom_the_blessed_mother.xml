        <p tid="2">In this famous scripture, known popularly as <title xml:lang="en">The Heart
            Sūtra</title>, the Buddha Śākyamuni inspires his senior monk Śāriputra to request
          instructions from the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara on the way to practice the perfection of
          wisdom. Avalokiteśvara then describes how an aspiring practitioner of the perfection of
          wisdom must first understand how all phenomena lack an intrinsic nature, which amounts to
          the realization of emptiness. Next, Avalokiteśvara reveals a brief mantra that the
          practitioner can recite as a method for engendering this understanding experientially.
          Following Avalokiteśvara’s teaching, the Buddha offers his endorsement and confirms that
          this is the foremost way to practice the perfection of wisdom.</p>

            East and Central Asia for well over a millennium. Over the centuries, scholars and
            practitioners have continued to find deep meaning in this short scripture and vigorously
            debated its purpose and practice—and even whether to classify it as a sūtra or a tantra.
            Still today, <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title> continues to be recited around
            the world in monasteries, temples, and meditation centers in a variety of Buddhist
            traditions. As a result of its popularity, in more recent times the sūtra has been
            translated into a wide variety of modern languages that are available in print and
            online.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-034-009-9"/>
          <p tid="11">The sūtra takes place on Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha. Here the Buddha
            inspires his senior monk Śāriputra to request instructions from the bodhisattva
            Avalokiteśvara regarding the practice of the perfection of wisdom.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-034-009-10"> In Prajñāpāramitā literature in general, the presence of
              Avalokiteśvara as an interlocutor is unique to <title xml:lang="en">The Heart
                Sūtra</title>. Usually, this role is performed by other disciples of the Buddha,
              such as the elder Subhūti.</note> Prompted in this way, Avalokiteśvara describes how
            an aspiring practitioner of the perfection of wisdom must first understand that all
            phenomena lack an intrinsic nature and therefore are empty. To manifest this realization
            in the practitioner, Avalokiteśvara reveals a brief mantra to be recited: <mantra xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tadyathā gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā</mantra>.
            Following Avalokiteśvara’s teaching, the Buddha offers his endorsement of what has been
            said and confirms that this is indeed the foremost way to practice the perfection of
            wisdom.</p>

            scriptures—this short teaching exists in a variety of versions, recensions, and
            redactions in multiple canonical languages. Most importantly, <title xml:lang="en">The
              Heart Sūtra</title> exists in both a short and a long version (although the long
            version is also very brief) in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. In East Asia the shorter
            version, which is also the older one in terms of textual history, became the most
            popular, while in Tibet the longer version was favored. </p>

                <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title>’s Chinese origins were first pointed
                out in English by Jan Nattier (1992), who argued that the short version of <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title> was originally compiled in China rather than
                India. Nattier further suggested that <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title>
                was transmitted to the famous Chinese translator Xuanzang (600/602–64), who edited
                the Chinese text and subsequently translated it into
                Sanskrit. Some <term type="ignore">elements</term> in Nattier’s study, such as the
                role of Xuanzang in producing the Sanskrit translation and subsequently transmitting
                the sūtra within China, have since been challenged by other scholars, such as Dan
                Lusthaus (2003, pp. 81–87) and Kōsei Ishii (2015). For a critique of Lusthaus’s
                arguments, see Attwood 2020. Jeffrey Kotyk (2019, pp. 538–40) also argues that
                Xuanzang is unlikely to have received <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra
                </title>prior to his journey to India but suggests that he may have compiled it in
                Chinese after his return to China. Nevertheless, Nattier’s main thesis—that the
                short version of <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title> was originally
                compiled in China based on existing sources in Chinese—still appears the most
                compelling account of events. Notably, Shi (2014) was the first scholar to apply
                Nattier’s methods to other parts of the text. Over the last decade, Jayarava Attwood

              sūtra was translated from Chinese into Sanskrit. The material used to compile the
              sūtra was extracted from key passages in Prajñāpāramitā scriptures in Chinese
              translation, especially Kumārajīva’s (344–413 <hi rend="small-caps">ce)</hi>
              translation of <title xml:lang="en">The Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-Five Thousand
                Lines</title> (Taishō 223). These central statements were then framed by an
              introduction describing the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara’s role as the teacher, and then
              a concluding mantra, which functioned to encapsulate the blessings of the
              Prajñāpāramitā teachings.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-034-009-15">
                <p tid="69">This mantra was most likely extracted from the Chinese translation of

              all of them clearly belong to the same family in text-historical terms. Unfortunately,

              the same time, the two Tibetan translations, which were subsequently included in the

            <p tid="23">In the Tengyur collections seven commentaries on the long sūtra by Indian
              scholars and one by a Chinese scholar are included in Tibetan translation. Some of
              these commentaries were composed by such well-known names in Tibetan history as
              Kamalaśīla (740–95), Vimalamitra (eighth/ninth c.), and Atīśa (982–1054).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-034-009-42"> Seven of the commentaries are included in
                the Degé Tengyur (Toh 3818–3823, all in the Perfection of Wisdom section, and Toh
                4353, in the Miscellaneous section). The eighth commentary is only included in the
                Peking (P 5221) and Narthang (3994) Tengyurs. All eight commentaries have been
                translated into English and commented upon by Donald Lopez (1996).</note> The
              authors of these commentaries were all active from the eighth to the eleventh century
              and most of them are known to have visited Tibet. Interestingly, the different
              commentators view<title xml:lang="en"> The Heart Sūtra</title> through very diverse
              hermeneutical lenses and interpret it variously through the systems of sūtra, tantra,
              and even ritual practice (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sādhana</foreign>). This great
              variety of interpretations, combined with the fact that there is no mention of <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title> in any other source linked to India, makes it
              seem likely that the commentaries were all composed in Tibet during the sojourns of
              these Indian masters there.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-034-009-43"> We know that
                Kamalaśīla, Vimalamitra, Atīśa, Vajrapāṇi (eleventh century), and Mahājana (eleventh
                century) all visited Tibet. Moreover, according to Toshio Horiuchi (2021), at least
                the two commentaries by Śrīsiṃha (dates uncertain) and Jñānamitra (dates uncertain)
                were composed directly in Tibetan. As for Praśāstrasena (dates uncertain), we do not
                have any biographical details, so it is not clear whether he ever visited Tibet or
                where his commentary was composed. </note>

            <p tid="24">It therefore appears that the history of the long sūtra can be told largely
              as a Sino-Tibetan exchange of ideas and manuscripts, which unfolded during the eighth
              to the eleventh century. In this regard, there are strong indications that the
              Dunhuang region was an important center for the exchange of such ideas and
              manuscripts. Among the scriptural treasures discovered in the Dunhuang caves in the
              early twentieth century, all of which must date prior to the turn of the eleventh
              century when the caves at Dunhuang were sealed off, there are numerous manuscripts of
                <title xml:lang="en">The Heart Sūtra</title> in both Chinese and Tibetan. In
              addition to the shorter versions mentioned above, there are a number of longer
              versions, and apparently even a few “hybrid” manuscripts that are neither of the
