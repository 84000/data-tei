                <p tid="2">In the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, a god has reached the end of his life. He foresees his
                    rebirth as a pig and calls out to the Buddha to save him. The Buddha prompts him to seek refuge in
                    the Three Jewels and, as a result, the god finds himself reborn into a wealthy family in Vaiśālī. In
                    this life as a child named Jñānaka, he encounters the Buddha once more and invites him and his monks
                    for a midday meal. The Buddha prophesies to Ānanda that the meritorious offering made by Jñānaka
                    will eventually lead the child to awaken as the buddha known as King of Foremost Knowing.</p>

                            Sūtra of Jñānaka</title> relates the otherwise unimaginable workings of karma across several
                        lifetimes, beginning with a god in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. This god has reached the end
                        of his life and foresees his rebirth in the womb of a pig in Vaiśālī, the Licchavi capital at
                        the time of the Buddha. Another god overhears his cries of agony and encourages him to call upon
                        the Buddha, who is staying in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to give teachings to his mother,
                        who had passed away not long after his birth. The Buddha prompts the dying god to seek refuge in
                        the Three Jewels, and, instead of being reborn to the sow, the god finds himself born into a
                        merchant family in Vaiśālī. Immediately after his birth, he praises the Three Jewels, leading
                        his astounded parents to name him Jñānaka, “He Who Possesses Knowledge.” At the age of eight, Jñānaka
                        encounters the Buddha on an alms round. Recollecting his past life, he offers alms to the Buddha
                        and invites him and his monks to a midday meal at his parents’ home. Jñānaka’s parents make
                        elaborate preparations to receive the Buddha and his monks, which prompts the Buddha to prophesy
                        that Jñānaka’s offerings will act as the cause for his eventual awakening as the buddha known as
                        King of Foremost Knowing.</p>

                        body had started to smell, sweat dripped from his armpits, and he felt unhappy on his seat. This god foresaw his rebirth in the womb of a pig in Vaiśālī, causing him to be
                        overcome with misery and cry out in woe. He beat his chest as he wept uncontrollably.</p>

                        request. Aware that the Blessed One had accepted by not speaking, the child Jñānaka went before
                        his parents and announced, “Dear father and mother, I offered alms to the Blessed One and have

                        delight. Filled with joy and elation, they arranged a spread of delicious foods and tasty
                        delicacies that very night. They had the entire city of Vaiśālī swept clean and strung with silk
                        tassels. They lit incense in incense burners, sprinkled fragrant water, and elegantly scattered
                        flowers. When the night had passed and the appropriate time had come, they went to the Blessed
                        One and said, “Honorable One, Blessed One, it is time for the midday meal. The food is ready.”</p>

                    <p tid="43">At dawn, the Blessed One donned his lower garment, dressed in his robes, and picked up
                        his alms bowl. Escorted and encircled by an assembly of monks, he went to the home of Jñānaka’s
                        parents where they sat upon seats that had been prepared for them. Noticing that the Blessed One
                        and the saṅgha of monks were seated, the child Jñānaka brought forth many delicious foods and
                        tasty delicacies, offering them carefully with his own hands. Seeing that the Blessed One had
                        finished his midday meal, he presented a set of cotton robes and a pair of sandals to each
                        member of the saṅgha, and three new robes and a pair of new shoes to the Blessed One. <ref cRef="F.289.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-075-002-71"/> He scattered gold and silver
                        flowers that, through the power of the Buddha, immediately transformed above the Blessed One’s
                        head into a glistening, elegant mansion with four corners and four rooms. Within this mansion,
                        the child Jñānaka beheld the figure of the Thus-Gone One sitting cross-legged and teaching the
                        Dharma.</p>

                        the child Jñānaka was joyful, elated, and filled with happiness. He said to the Blessed One,
                        “Blessed One, I dedicate my roots of virtue to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. May
                        these roots of virtue lead me to awaken, teach the Dharma, and sustain the saṅgha just like the
                        present Blessed One.”</p>

                    <p tid="45">Aware of the intent of the child Jñānaka, the Blessed One smiled, <distinct>and so forth, up until</distinct> the light dissolved into the crown of his head.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-075-002-81">This refers to a stock phrase that normally reads in full (with some minor variations across texts): “The Blessed One then smiled, and as happens whenever the blessed ones smile, at that moment light of myriad colors—blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystalline, and silver—emerged from his mouth. The light illuminated boundless, limitless realms and reached all the way up to the world of Brahmā. It even eclipsed the magnificence of the sun and moon. Then the light rays returned, circled around the Blessed One three times, and dissolved into the crown of his head.” (See <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-059-002.html#UT22084-059-002-304">

Usually the question is articulated to the Buddha, rather than here where Ānanda merely wonders in his thoughts. Although there are all sorts of variant versions that differ in length and content, the following example is typical of shorter versions: “At this point, Venerable Ānanda arose from his seat and, placing his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee. With palms pressed together in the direction of the Blessed One, he spoke the following words to the Blessed One: ‘Blessed One, since the thus-gone, worthy, completely awakened buddhas do not smile without a cause, without a reason, what is the cause for your smile? What is the reason?’.” (See <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-043-009.html#UT22084-043-009-139">
