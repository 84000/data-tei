                            Sūtra of Jñānaka</title> relates the otherwise unimaginable workings of karma across several
                        lifetimes, beginning with a god in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. This god has reached the end
                        of his life and foresees his rebirth in the womb of a pig in Vaiśālī, the Licchavi capital at
                        the time of the Buddha. Another god overhears his cries of agony and encourages him to call upon
                        the Buddha, who is staying in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to give teachings to his mother,
                        who had passed away not long after his birth. The Buddha prompts the dying god to seek refuge in
                        the Three Jewels, and, instead of being reborn to the sow, the god finds himself born into a
                        merchant family in Vaiśālī. Immediately after his birth, he praises the Three Jewels, leading
                        his astounded parents to name him Jñānaka, “He Who Possesses Knowledge.” At the age of eight, Jñānaka
                        encounters the Buddha on an alms round. Recollecting his past life, he offers alms to the Buddha
                        and invites him and his monks to a midday meal at his parents’ home. Jñānaka’s parents make
                        elaborate preparations to receive the Buddha and his monks, which prompts the Buddha to prophesy
                        that Jñānaka’s offerings will act as the cause for his eventual awakening as the buddha known as
                        King of Foremost Knowing.</p>

                        upon the Pāṇḍukambala rock. There was a god there experiencing the five

                        body had started to smell, sweat dripped from his armpits, and he felt unhappy on his seat. This god foresaw his rebirth in the womb of a pig in Vaiśālī, causing him to be
                        overcome with misery and cry out in woe. He beat his chest as he wept uncontrollably.</p>

He was as well trained as an elephant, and as lucid, limpid, and clear as a lake. His body was adorned with the thirty-two characteristics of a great being, and he was ornamented with the eighty fine marks. He had the body of a thus-gone one, bedecked like the king of sal trees. Like the sun, he emitted a profusion of light rays everywhere. He was like a conflagration raging atop a mountain peak in the middle of a dark night, and brilliant and shining like a golden mountain.” (See <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-090-002.html#UT22084-090-002-250">
