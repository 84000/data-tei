                    <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching on the Great Compassion of the Tathāgata</title> opens with the Buddha presiding over a
                    large congregation of disciples at Vulture Peak. Entering a special state of meditative absorption 
                    (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samādhi</foreign>), he magically displays a pavilion in the sky, attracting a vast audience of divine and human
                    Dharma followers. At the request of the bodhisattva Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja, the Buddha gives a discourse on the qualities of
                    bodhisattvas, which are specified as bodhisattva ornaments, illuminations, compassion, and activities. He also teaches about the
                    compassionate awakening of tathāgatas and the scope of a tathāgata’s activities. At the request of a bodhisattva named Siṃhaketu,
                    Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja then gives a discourse on eight <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dhāraṇīs</foreign>, following which the Buddha
                    explains the sources and functions of a dhāraṇī known as <distinct>the jewel lamp</distinct>. As the text concludes, various
                    deities and Dharma protectors praise the sūtra’s qualities and vow to preserve and protect it in the future, and the Buddha
                    entrusts the sūtra and its propagation to Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja.</p>

                        according to topic. The first of these divisions, focusing on the elements of
                        the bodhisattva path, is taught by the Buddha at the request of the bodhisattva Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja; the second, 
                        focusing on the dhāraṇīs, is a teaching by Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja; while the third is the Buddha’s endorsement of 
                        Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja’s teaching, his narration of past events involving Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja
                        in previous lifetimes, and his proclamation that it is Dhāraṇīśvara­rāja who should transmit the entire

                        of monks and bodhisattvas. He enters a state of meditative
                        absorption in which he <term type="ignore">manifests</term> an extravagant pavilion in the atmosphere between the desire realm
                        and the form realm. He proceeds to ascend to the pavilion, along with his retinue, by way of an enormous staircase, one of
                        four thousand that have appeared. As he passes the six heavens of the sensuous realm, their inhabitants praise him and join
                        the ever-increasing throng, until the vast congregation finally arrives in the lofty pavilion. From the pavilion, the Buddha
                        sends invitations in the form of light rays to the bodhisattvas who reside in the buddhafields of the ten directions,
                        announcing the teaching he is about to give. In an instant, those bodhisattvas reach the pavilion together with their
                        entourages. By simply clearing his throat, the Buddha enjoins all the faithful beings remaining in the human and nonhuman
                        realms to ascend the staircases and join the vast congregation. He then emits a light that leads a bodhisattva named
                        Puṣpaśrī­garbha­sarva­dharma­vaśavartin to enter a state of absorption in which a teaching throne magically appears. The
                        bodhisattva requests a teaching from the Buddha, who ascends the throne and delivers an introduction to the forthcoming
                        teaching. Nine different bodhisattvas each enter a different state of meditative absorption, and those absorptions together
                        bless the assembly with their corresponding qualities. When a tenth bodhisattva called Māra­pramardaka enters absorption, a
                        host of māras enters the assembly. After a brief exchange with the Blessed One, they also settle down to listen to the
                        discourse. </p>

                        teachings. The bodhisattva articulates how wonderful it is when a buddha engages in benefiting beings, and he concludes by
                        highlighting the contrast between the bodhisattva intention and the intentions represented by the Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha
                        Vehicles. As a result of his exclamations, an immense number of beings generate the thought of awakening. The Buddha then

                        tradition offers reasons for linking it to the buddha nature tradition. One is the fact that the sūtra contains the

                        turnings of the wheel of Dharma as delineated in Tibetan Buddhist hermeneutics.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-057-006-20">

                        explicitly identifies itself as belonging to the “irreversible turning,” a term that the Tibetan commentarial tradition
                        associates with the third turning. Both considerations are suggestive of the sūtra’s close connection with the hermeneutical

                        Why is that? Because the tathāgatas are not forgetful. Son of noble family, as soon as tathāgatas awaken into unsurpassed,
                        perfect awakening, they behold the mindstreams of all sentient beings of the past, present, and future. Still, they are not

                        wisdom regarding it. The mindfulness of tathāgatas does not deteriorate when they assign beings to three groups, engage with
                        their faculties and mentalities, and behold their conduct. The tathāgatas’ teaching of the Dharma to beings happens without
                        activating their <term type="ignore">recollection</term>, without intention or analysis. Even while teaching, their

                        beings accordingly. This is the twenty-third tathāgata activity of the tathāgatas. About this it has been proclaimed:</p>
