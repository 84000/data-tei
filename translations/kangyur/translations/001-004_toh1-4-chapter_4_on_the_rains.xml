                    chapters. It sets out the
                    Rite of Pledging to Settle for the Rains, in which monastics pledge to remain at
                    a single site for the duration of the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">varṣā</foreign> or summer rains. 
                    It concludes with a lengthy presentation of
                    cases in which a monastic incurs no offense for interrupting the rains by
                    prematurely leaving a site.</p>
                <p tid="304">This is the third of the “Three
                    Rites,” along with the Rite of Restoration and the Rite of Lifting Restrictions, which are set out in <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on the Restoration

                        Lifting Restrictions</title> respectively. The regular
                    observance of the “Three Rites” at an officially demarcated monastic site is
                    considered a crucial component in ensuring the integrity of the monastics living

                    <p tid="308">In the Buddha’s time, much like today, the Gangetic plain had three
                        distinct seasons—a cool season, a hot season, and a rainy monsoon
                        season—each said traditionally to last for roughly four months. During the monsoon rains, it was
                        customary for mendicants, ordinarily peripatetic, to settle at a single
                        site, often in a park with other ascetics, where they might pass the rains
                        in relative comfort. According to the formalities described in this chapter for
                        the Buddha’s followers, monastics could choose to reside for the first or last three 
                        of the four monsoon months. </p>

                            In the first, a story about Udayana, the Buddha formulates the rule that
                            monks who have undertaken a rains retreat should not go beyond the
                            boundary of the site where they have settled, while in the second the
                            Buddha makes an allowance for this rule and gives his consent to travel for a
                            period of up to seven days so that monastics can tend to the business of
                            male lay vow holders, monks, nuns, nun postulants, male novices, and
                            female novices. </p>

                            offense for interrupting the rains by prematurely leaving a site. The
                            stated reasons include a lack of alms, medicine, or nurses. But the
                            chapter also identifies other invitations that would hinder the
                            renunciant’s vocation and so are not excused. These include interrupting
                            the rains in response to the offers of women or girls, the appearance of
                            an attractive woman, or a treasure trove that might tempt the monk into
                            giving up the renunciant’s life, or kin who encourage the same.</p>

                                “should pledge to a rainy season site.” The Tibetan-language sources
                                thus suggest that Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya authors understood
                                    <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">upa√gam</foreign> in a
                                specialized sense, meaning “to pledge” or “commit,” which is closely
                                related to the more common senses of “to enter into” or “undertake.”
                                The Tibetan translations emphasize the commitment made to undertake
                                the rains retreat, alluded to by Kalyāṇamitra above. Yijing’s
                                Chinese translation reads, “Therefore, I now make a rule that monks
                                settle [or ‘do a retreat’] and stay in one place for three months”

                                Brahmāli renders this with admirable economy and accuracy as “enter

                                    bya</foreign> could also be translated, according to context, as

                                Yijing’s translations also give typically economical forms

                                <p>A saṅgha at ease is a properly functioning monastic community,
                                    where official acts of the saṅgha, but especially the
                                    restoration rite, are observed. Kalyāṇamitra twice glosses the
                                    phrase “be at ease.” In the first example, he explains that
                                    monks are at ease in the knowledge that so long as they are on
                                    site, they will never be considered “separated from” their
                                    mantle, which would otherwise entail a fault. In a subsequent
                                    gloss, he writes that “to be at ease” means “to obtain purity”
                                    and hence “the joy felt due to the remission of one’s offenses.”
                                    This describes the state of a monastic who has made amends for
                                    their offenses. See Kalyāṇamitra (F.313.b–314.a)<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4113.html"/>:
