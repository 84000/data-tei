          literature—the story of the Buddha’s half-brother Nanda—<title xml:lang="en">The Teaching
            to the Venerable Nanda on Dwelling in the Womb</title> offers the Buddha’s detailed
          account of the thirty-eight weeks of human gestation. The Buddha gives this teaching to
          Nanda after taking him to visit other realms, as the final method to break Nanda of his
          infatuation with his beautiful wife and settle him in the monastic life and its result.
          The sūtra explains conception in terms of how the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">antarābhava</foreign> (the being in the state between death in one life and birth in
          the next) enters the womb, and it details the physical composition of the embryo, the
          suffering of the newborn being, and the miseries experienced over the course of a
          lifetime. After the concluding verses, there is also an account of Nanda’s past lives.
          Including as it does the most comprehensive ancient Indian account of gestation, this
          sūtra was an important source for embryology in Tibetan medicine. </p>

              Sanskrit would be translated “<title xml:lang="en">The Noble Teaching to Nanda on
                Entry into the Womb</title>.”</note> famously describes the thirty-eight weeks of
            human gestation. Though the details vary somewhat, all versions of the sūtra discuss
            conception, the composition of the embryo, the gestation period, the newborn being, the
            course of life and its sufferings, and the need to practice for one’s own good and the
            good of others. The present version, in addition to the narrative frame of the story of
            Nanda, includes at the end several stories of Nanda’s past lives. Among these is a
            description of what actions bore fruit in Nanda’s last life, in which he was golden in
            complexion, possessed thirty of the thirty-two marks of a great being, was only four
            finger-widths shorter than the Buddha, and became renowned as the disciple most adept at

            defects of the womb that prevent the mother from conceiving. In this section, the

            between death in one life and birth in the next) is said to have deluded thoughts about
            the womb that it is entering. If the antarābhava’s karma is good, it thinks it is
            entering, for example, a celestial palace. If the antarābhava has bad karma, it imagines
            that it is entering an unpleasant place, like a hole in a wall.</p>

            The text has survived in three different translations in Chinese and in three Tibetan

            made from the Sanskrit. In terms of their content, these six surviving Chinese and
            Tibetan versions fall into two main groups: the shorter versions that consist of the
            Buddha’s teaching to his younger half-brother Nanda on the subject of conception,
            gestation, and childbirth, and the longer versions that also provide a frame narrative
            explaining that the teaching was given because Nanda, infatuated with his wife, had been
            reluctant to take monk’s vows and needed to be convinced by the Buddha. After the
            concluding verses, there is an account of Nanda’s past lives, which explains how Nanda
            was fortunate enough to have been delivered from saṃsāra and established in nirvāṇa. In
            the body of the sūtra in its longer versions, there is much added material not
            specifically related to conception, gestation, or childbirth, and there is also more
            detail about conception and the antarābhava than in the shorter versions. The present

          <p tid="19">There are also two different long versions. One was translated into Chinese in
            the early eighth century by Yijing (Taishō 1451) as part of his translation into Chinese
            of the Mūla­sarvāsti­vāda Vinaya. According to the Chinese catalog, <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Kaiyuan shijiao lu</title>
            <title xml:lang="zh">開元釋教錄</title> (Taishō 2154.585c15–19), Bodhiruci inserted Yijing’s
            translation from the Mūla­sarvāsti­vāda Vinaya into the Chinese Ratnakūṭa collection
            (Taishō 310–314). This translation was, in turn, the source for the translation in the
            Tibetan Ratnakūṭa (Toh 57), the text translated here. The second long version does not
            exist in Chinese and is not an independent sūtra but is found embedded, like many other
            passages that may originally have also circulated independently, in the
            Mūla­sarvāsti­vāda Vinaya, specifically in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kṣudrakavastu</title> (<title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on Minor Matters of Monastic

            the ninth century, and the passage within it that contains this teaching therefore
            differs somewhat from the corresponding passage in Yijing’s translation in the Chinese
            Mūla­sarvāsti­vāda Vinaya.</p>

            versions of the text, one Chinese translation of the second short version, and one
            Chinese translation of the first long version. With respect to the Tibetan translations
            in the Kangyur, there are also three versions of the text: the long and short versions
            in the Ratnakūṭa (Toh 57 and 58), both translated from Chinese, and a passage embedded
            in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kṣudrakavastu</title> (Toh 6), which is a long version
            that was translated directly from Sanskrit instead of Chinese. The details of this group

              Phangthangma, p. 48.</note> as well as in the list compiled by Butön prior to the
            appearance of the first Kangyurs, the Tibetan titles of the two texts seem to have been
            switched by comparison with the Chinese: the text with the Tibetan title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mngal du ’jug pa</title>, “Entry into the Womb,” is a translation of
            the Chinese text (Taishō 310 [13]) with the title <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Chutai
              hui</title>
            <title xml:lang="zh">處胎會</title>, “Scripture on Dwelling in the Womb.” The text with the
            Tibetan title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mngal du gnas pa</title>, “Dwelling in the Womb,”
            is a translation of the Chinese text (Taishō 310 [14]) with the title <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Rutai jing</title>
            <title xml:lang="zh">入胎經</title>, “Sūtra on Entry into the Womb.” The Denkarma and
            Butön, whose lists of Ratnakūṭa texts both follow the order of the Chinese Ratnakūṭa
            closely in other respects, both differ from it in listing the longer of these texts
            before the shorter.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-72"> See Butön, folio

            result of these early lists, some Kangyurs, including the Degé, also include the two

              du ’jug pa</title> (Toh 58), which is chapter 13 in the Chinese Ratnakūṭa, “chapter
            14,” and <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mngal du gnas pa</title> (Toh 57), which is chapter 14

              addition to the Degé, the Kangyurs in which the two texts are ordered in this way are

              Palace Kangyurs, as well as in the Mongolian Kangyur, the order reflects that of the

            She was a good lady, pleasant to behold, with a beautiful figure and a superior
            complexion rare in the world. Since everyone wished to look at her, Nanda, because he
            desired and was obsessed with her, did not leave her alone even for a moment. Due to his
            lustful mind, he became very attached and considered her as valuable as his own

          <p tid="35">The Bhagavān, knowing that the time had come to tame Nanda, dressed early in
            the morning, took his bowl, and, with the venerable Ānanda as his attendant, went to the
            city to collect alms. In due course, they arrived at the place where Nanda’s house was,
            and going to the door, they stood there. Then, by the power of great compassion, the
            Bhagavān emitted a golden light, and the entire interior of Nanda’s house turned the
            color of refined gold.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-92"/>
          <p tid="36">At that time, Nanda thought, “Since this light is all-illuminating, it must
            undoubtedly be the Tathāgata’s.” Thinking this, <ref cRef="F.206.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-674"/> he dispatched a man, ordering him, “Go see who it

          <p tid="38">When Nanda heard that, he quickly went out and greeted the Bhagavān. After
            Nanda paid obeisance, at that time Sundarikā thought, “If I let Nanda go, he will
            doubtlessly go forth because of the Bhagavān.” Grabbing Nanda by the edge of his
            garment, she did not let go. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-95"/>
          <p tid="39">“Now let go for a minute,” said Nanda. “I will pay obeisance to the Bhagavān,

          <p tid="40">“First, let’s make an agreement; then I’ll let you go,” said Sundarikā. She
            put the mark of a wet tilaka on his forehead, and she said, “Please return before this
            tilaka is dry. If you are delayed, there will be a penalty of five hundred gold
            kārṣāpanas.”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-97"/>
          <p tid="41">“I will do so,” said Nanda. Going out the door, he bowed down at the
            Bhagavān’s feet. He took the Tathāgata’s bowl and went back into the house. After
            filling the bowl with good food, Nanda again went out the door. Since the Bhagavān had
            returned to the monastery, he offered it to Ānanda. But the Bhagavān had indicated that
            Ānanda should not take the bowl. Because of the overwhelming majesty of the Tathāgata,
            the Great Teacher, Nanda did not have the confidence to offer it to him with the words,
            “Please receive this,” so he again offered it to Ānanda. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-98"/>
          <p tid="42">Ānanda asked, “From whom did you receive this bowl?” </p>

          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-101"/>
          <p tid="45">Nanda answered, “I don’t have the confidence to offer it to the Great

          <p tid="46">When the Bhagavān had returned to the monastery, he washed his hands, bathed

            him. When the Bhagavān finished eating, he asked Nanda, “Will you eat what is left in my
            bowl?”</p>
          <p tid="47">“Yes, please,” he answered, and the Bhagavān gave it to him. </p>

          <p tid="48">Nanda finished eating, and the Bhagavān asked, “Will you go forth?”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-105"/>
          <p tid="49">Nanda answered, “I will go forth.” Furthermore, because the Bhagavān Buddha,
            when he engaged in the practices of a bodhisattva in the past, never opposed the
            instructions of his parents, preceptors, teachers, or other gurus, he had now attained
            the state in which nothing he said was opposed. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-106"/>
          <p tid="50">Then the Bhagavān said to Ānanda, “Shave Nanda’s hair and beard.” </p>
          <p tid="51">“As the Bhagavān wishes,” replied Ānanda, and he searched for a barber. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-108"/>
          <p tid="52">As soon as the barber began cutting Nanda’s hair, Nanda said to him, “Hey!
            Don’t you know? It won’t be long before I become a powerful cakravartin. If you shave my
            hair and beard, I will cut off both your hands!” Intimidated, the barber became very
            frightened, and he put away his razor and started to leave. Then the venerable Ānanda
            told the Bhagavān what had happened.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-109"/>
          <p tid="53">The Bhagavān went to Nanda and asked, “Will you not go forth?” </p>
          <p tid="54">Nanda answered, “I will go forth.” The Bhagavān then took a vase and poured
            water on Nanda’s head, and the barber shaved Nanda’s hair and beard. Nanda thought, “I
            will honor the Buddha for now and go forth, but I will return home in the evening.” </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-111"/>
          <p tid="55">In the evening, Nanda took to the road and left. <ref cRef="F.207.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-676"/> When Nanda saw a great chasm conjured by
            the Bhagavān ahead of him on the road, he thought, “As for the time agreed upon with
            Sundarikā, since I am still far away, I have no possibility of arriving on time. Now, it
            is possible that I will die from just thinking about her. If I do not die, I will go
            tomorrow morning.” He passed the night in suffering and misery due to yearning for
            Sundarikā.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-112"/>
          <p tid="56">Knowing what Nanda was thinking, the Bhagavān said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and
            order Nanda to act as caretaker in the monastery.” Ānanda accordingly went directly to
            Nanda.</p>
          <p tid="57">Ānanda told him, “The Bhagavān orders you to be the caretaker.”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-114"/>
          <p tid="58">Nanda asked, “What duties does a ‘caretaker’ perform?”</p>
          <p tid="59">“He must supervise the monks’ chores in the monastery,” said Ānanda.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-116"/>
          <p tid="60">Nanda asked, “In what way should he work?”</p>

          <p tid="61">“As for the caretaker,” answered Ānanda, “when the monks go out for alms, he
            must sweep the monastery grounds and sprinkle them with water. He must take fresh cow
            dung and gently spread it in the proper way. Paying careful attention, he should guard
            against loss. If any advice is necessary, he should ask the monks. If there is incense
            and flowers, he should distribute them to the monks. He should close the gates at night
            and open them in the morning. He must always clean and wipe down the toilet and urinal.
            If something in the monastery falls apart, he must repair it well.” </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-118"/>
          <p tid="62">Nanda, having heard the explanation, accepted it, saying, “Venerable Ānanda, I
            shall do everything according to the Bhagavān’s command.”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-119"/>
          <p tid="63">The next morning, the monks put on their lower robes, took their upper robes
            and bowls, and left for the city of Kapilavastu on their alms round. <ref cRef="F.207.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-677"/> Nanda, seeing that nobody was in the
            monastery, thought, “As soon as I finish sweeping, I’ll go back home,” and did the
            sweeping. The Bhagavān saw him and knew, so, with his supernormal abilities, he cast a
            spell so that the clean ground that had been swept was again full of rubbish. Nanda then
            thought, “I’ll throw away the rubbish and go back home.” He put the broom down and began
            to throw away the rubbish, but, since it was never-ending, he thought, “I will close the
            doors of the dwelling places and leave.” He began to close the doors of the dwelling
            places, but the Bhagavān cast a spell so that as soon as Nanda closed one door, another
            door would open. That troubled Nanda, and he had this thought: “Even if a thief harms
            this monastery, whatever damage there is, when I become king, I will build a hundred
            thousand excellent monasteries much greater than this one. As for me, I’ll go back
            home.” And then he thought, “If I stay on the main road, I’m afraid I’ll meet the
            Bhagavān, so I’ll take a side road.”</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-120"/>
          <p tid="64">The Bhagavān, knowing what Nanda was thinking, took that very same shortcut.
            Nanda, seeing the Bhagavān from a distance, hid near a tree at the side of the road that
            had shady branches hanging down, in order to avoid him. The Bhagavān cast a spell to
            make the tree lift up its branches and show Nanda’s body. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-121"/>
          <p tid="65">Then the Bhagavān called out, “Nanda, where are you going? Come along after
            me!” Ashamed and embarrassed, Nanda followed in attendance upon him. The Bhagavān
            thought, “Since Nanda is very attached to his wife and is obsessed with her, in order to
            help him separate from her I will leave Kapilavastu <ref cRef="F.208.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-002-678"/> and go to Śrāvastī.” Thinking in this way, he went

              involving Nanda. In the first, Nanda ejaculates on Viśākhā’s head when she touches his
              feet. Upon hearing this, the Buddha absolves Nanda and recommends that monks wear a
              pouch in case of accidental ejaculation. In the second incident, Mahākāśyapa comes
              across Nanda, who is drawing a picture of Sundarikā, and reports him to the Buddha.
              This results in the Buddha forbidding monks from depicting living beings, although
              they are allowed to decorate stūpas (vol. tha, folios 241.a.1–142.b.7;<ref inst="folios 241.a.1–142.b.7" rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh6.html"/> see Formigatti 2009, pp.

            thought, “Since this foolish Nanda is continually attached to his wife and obsessed with
            her, he will not let go of her, so I must apply skillful means and pacify his mind.”</p>

            arrived at Mount Gandhamādana together with the venerable Nanda, they looked right and
            left. Under a tree, a blind, one-eyed female monkey raised her face and intently looked
            right at the Bhagavān. The Bhagavān asked Nanda, “Do you see this blind monkey?” </p>

          <p tid="71">“Sundarikā is a Śākya,” said Nanda. “She is like a young goddess. Her face is
            the best; she is peerless in the world. Therefore, if you compare her to this monkey,
            the monkey does not come close to being one-hundredth, one-thousandth,

              The Tibetan here is difficult to understand, though if the referent of “all of these

              the sense is that because one has not abandoned the sufferings of birth, then one is
              bound to experience suffering in everything that one does in life. In the Chinese, by
              contrast, there is no negative: “All this is abandoning suffering and seeking
              suffering.” In the Chinese, this sentence seems to refer to the four activities of
              walking, etc., and the meaning seems to be that one “abandons suffering” when, for
              example, one stops walking and “seeks suffering” when one stands still. At the same
              point, Toh 6 says “Nanda, because one interrupts the suffering of a particular
              activity, when a new, different suffering arises, a pleasurable thought arises. Nanda,

            faculties. It experiences the suffering of being constantly tormented in an unclean pot.
            When the mother stands, or sits, or lies down, the fetus experiences exceedingly
            intolerable suffering, as if bound with five bonds or scorched by fire, with which

            it is tormented, the fetus also is tormented. Because it is tormented, it experiences
            many sufferings. Because it experiences many sufferings, it is agitated. Because it is
            agitated, the body will be incorrectly sideways and unable to emerge. Then a wise woman
