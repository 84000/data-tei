                        named Śrībhadra. The text opens with the god Śrībhadra asking Mañjuśrī why he is still making
                        offerings to the Buddha given his advanced spiritual progress. In the ensuing dialogue, Mañjuśrī
                        delivers a teaching that he had previously given to the Brahmā god Śikhin called <title xml:lang="en">The Fourfold Accomplishment</title>. </p>

                        which is divided into four subtopics. The text takes on a distinctly mnemonic character in which
                        the fourfold rubric might allow anyone reading or reciting the text to memorize a broad range of
                        topics related to the practice of a bodhisattva. In addition to this mnemonic application, each
                        brief list of four particular accomplishments invites broader commentary, and in this sense the
                        text provides a readily accessible framework for teaching the bodhisattva path. </p>

                        bodhisattvas seated upon lotuses, and Mañjuśrī explains to Śrībhadra that all of these
                        bodhisattvas are a magical emanation, just like his celestial flower offering. This brings a
                        smile to the Buddha’s lips, and the text introduces its next topic: why, exactly, do buddhas
                        smile? The question, a recurring motif in sūtra literature, remains unanswered as it echoes in
                        the refrains of a set of poetic verses that Śrībhadra recites before the Buddha. </p>

                    <p tid="13">The sūtra then turns to a brief dialogue between the Buddha, the god Śrībhadra, and Śāriputra, in
                        which Śāriputra doubts whether there could in fact be innumerable buddhafields and innumerable
                        bodhisattvas who populate them. In his reply, the Buddha delivers a teaching on the vast
                        cosmology of infinite buddhafields. The sūtra then concludes with two additional teachings from
                        Mañjuśrī on thirty-five qualities that ripen bodhisattvas for awakening and ten types of pride
                        that bodhisattvas should avoid. </p>
