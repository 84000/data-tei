                <p tid="2">This short philosophical discourse opens with the Buddha described as
                    unmoving from the true nature of all things. Although at this time he has no
                    thought of teaching the Dharma, different members of the audience nevertheless
                    believe that they have heard a teaching. On the basis of their differing
                    perceptions, five distinct philosophical views concerning the true nature of all
                    things come to be held by different members of the audience. When Mañjuśrī, who
                    is also in the audience, becomes aware that they are harboring these different
                    understandings, he asks the Buddha why such different views have arisen, whether
                    they are equally valid, and whether such differences will be a matter of dispute
                    in the future. The Buddha replies that different understandings arise because of
                    the different inclinations and aptitudes of people; that of the five views only
                    the fifth is fully in accord with the experiential domain of all buddhas; and he
                    predicts that in the future such differences in understanding will be argued
                    about for a very long time. Mañjuśrī then asks one final question: if these
                    differing views all have a single basis, what is that basis? The Buddha’s answer
                    is that although all experience is based on the aggregates, the constituents,
                    and the sense fields, even these things must not be reified if one is to reach
                    unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening.</p>

                            The title of this text is problematic on several counts. <title xml:lang="en">The Noble Sūtra on Appearing Differently to All

                            at the beginning of the text in the Degé Kangyur. However, the title
                            given at the end of the text is different insofar as the word
                            “emptiness” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">stong pa
                                nyid</foreign>) is absent and there is no dative particle (or

                            word “all” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">thams cad</foreign>),
                            which allows a different interpretation of “all” as referring to “all things” 
                            rather than “all” the people present; that version of the  title would translate as <title xml:lang="en">The

                            Chomden Raltri’s survey, and Butön’s history as discussed below. It also
                            matches more closely the title found in the Stok Palace Kangyur and

                                mdo</title>). Another problem is posed by the Sanskrit title 
                                including the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āloka</foreign> (“light” 
                                or “illumination”) which, despite the fact that it might have been a plausible back-translation into Sanskrit from

                                of the text been different, has a semantic range somewhat
                                difficult to fit with the most likely meanings of the Tibetan. Avoiding these ambiguities, the sūtra is referred to
                            in later Tibetan sources, such as those mentioned in the introduction,
                            by the simpler short title <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of Not

                        paradoxical nature of the Buddha’s teaching and of reality itself insofar as
                        both are simultaneously one and many.</p>

                    <p tid="11">This short and dense discourse has a narrative frame in which the
                        Buddha is himself described as being unmoving (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">acala</foreign>, Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mi g.yo ba</foreign>) from the true nature
                        of things, and as such, does not form any thought about teaching the Dharma.
                        Nevertheless, a teaching on the true nature of things is heard, but is heard
                        differently by the various members of the audience, based on their different
                            inclinations.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-055-002-91"> This
                            situation is not entirely dissimilar to the way the Buddha and his

                        five distinct philosophical views, or “analytic positions” or “ways of

                    <p tid="12">When Mañjuśrī becomes aware that members of the audience are
                        harboring these different understandings of the Buddha’s teaching on the
                        true nature of things, he decides to question the Buddha about it, inquiring
                        as to why such differences have arisen, whether such diverse views are
                        equally valid as means for achieving awakening, whether they will persist in
                        the future, and whether such differences will be a source of dispute. The
                        Buddha’s replies indicate that although all the different analytic positions
                        may all be seen as correct insofar as they go, the first four constitute
                        something like progressive steps along the way to the fifth and final view,
                        which alone is described as the unmistaken view that is in accordance with
                        the experiential domain of all buddhas. The Buddha then offers a series of
                        analogies by way of illustration. He also makes the prediction that these
                        differing views will persist long after his own <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">parinirvāṇa</foreign> and that in the future they will be

                        that basis? The Buddha’s answer, which is reminiscent of teachings on
                        emptiness found in the sūtras on the Perfection of Wisdom and elsewhere, is
                        that although the basis of all experience is the aggregates, constituents,
                        and sense fields, one must not reify even these if one is to reach
                        unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening. </p>
