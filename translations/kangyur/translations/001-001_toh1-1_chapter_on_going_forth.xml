                <p tid="1">“The Chapter on Going Forth” is the first of seventeen chapters in <title xml:lang="en">The Chapters on Monastic Discipline</title>,
                    a four-volume work that outlines the statutes and procedures that govern life in a Buddhist monastic community. This first chapter traces
                    the development of the rite by which postulants were admitted into the monastic order, from the Buddha Śākyamuni’s informal invitation to
                    “Come, monk,” to the more elaborate “Present Day Rite.” Along the way, the posts of preceptor and instructor are introduced, their
                    responsibilities defined, and a dichotomy between elders and immature novices described. While the heart of the chapter is a transcript of
                    the “Present Day Rite,” the text is interwoven with numerous narrative asides, depicting the spiritual ferment of the north Indian region of
                    Magadha during the Buddha’s lifetime, the follies of untrained and unsupervised apprentices, and the need for a formal system of
                    tutelage.</p>

                    identified numerous misspellings and mistakes in the glossaries. Both Ven. Damchö and Dr. Yao generously shared their extensive knowledge of
                    the Mūlasarvāstivādin Vinaya and furnished invaluable assistance in researching the translation. Matthew Wuethrich served as style

                        One hundred years later, a second council was convened at Vaiśālī to resolve disagreements that had arisen in relation to the code of

                        they are just young brahmins, well-schooled in Vedic learning and assured of bright futures. In time Upatiṣya proves himself to be a
                        brilliant interpreter of the Vedas, while Kolita, a talented teacher in his own right, is expected to succeed his father as royal priest
                        to the King of Rājagṛha. Though each hears of the other’s reputation from their young brahmin students, they do not meet until the feast
                        of the nāga kings Giri and Valguka, where they recognize one another as kindred spirits. After securing their parents’ consent, they
                        forego their given destinies and set off in search of a renunciant order to join.</p>

                            in both its philosophical details and its attribution of ideas from the account given in the present chapter. Claus Vogel (1970) has

                        “withdrawn into seclusion.” Duly impressed, they are won over and join his order upon hearing his philosophy—that “the Dharma is truth
                        and nonviolence; the peaceful, ageless, immortal, and unwaning state is Brahman.” Before long, however, Sañjayin passes away and the two

                        came to the Buddha’s order. In its telling, it emphasizes their exacting standards so that their rejection of each teacher’s philosophy
                        and eventual embrace of the Buddha’s implies the superiority of the Buddhist order. </p>

                        holy life,” the Buddha admitted them into his order and ordained them monks. This simple invitation is known as the “ordination by

                        new code of conduct and a new way of life. Consequently, some new monks had no sense of decorum and were poorly behaved. Local brahmins
                        and householders even complained of being harassed by them. The new monks would come to town to beg alms, disheveled and improperly
                        dressed, speaking shrilly in loud voices, behaving wildly, and demanding they be fed. </p>

                        of one’s fellow brahmacārin was too much and the saṅgha asked the Buddha to intervene. After some consideration, the Buddha created the
                        positions of preceptor and instructor and charged the monks in those roles with the responsibility of ordaining and instructing new

                        and a novel division of the community into lay vow holders, novices, and monks. This rite pertains to the present day and is known in

                    <p tid="53">One of the difficulties in translating vinaya texts lies in finding appropriate English equivalents for the language of Buddhist
                        monasticism. In several instances we have borrowed terms from Christianity such as “ordination” and “monk,” even though they may only
                        bear a superficial similarity to their Buddhist analogs.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-78"> Consider our use of the word
                            “ordination,” for instance. In Catholicism, one “professes” to become a monk and is “ordained” to become a priest. While a monk may
                            become a priest, the two are distinct vocations, the latter being a clerical office with specific rights and responsibilities not
                            shared by unordained monks. Since the Buddhist tradition does not distinguish between monastic and clerical offices, it is
                            misleading and perhaps even incorrect to translate the Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bsnyen par rdzogs pa</foreign>
                            (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">upasaṃpadā</foreign>) as “ordination.” However, as we have not yet come upon a
                            satisfactory translation for this term, we have decided to follow established precedent. We are indebted to Wulstan Fletcher for his
                            advice on this term. </note> Another difficulty lies in the historical fact that the language of Buddhist renunciation was adapted

                            distinctive culture, different from the Vedic society of Kuru-Pañcāla to the west. One of the main features of this Greater Magadhan

                        Kalyāṇamitra glosses it as a life of “hardships” or “austerities.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-91"> Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dka’ thub</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tapaḥ</foreign>. Kalyāṇamitra

                        assumptions about what it meant to “live the holy life.” For, as a Jain, Jñātiputra would certainly have equated “the holy life” with

According to
                            Anukul Chandra Banerjee’s <title xml:lang="en">Sarvāvastivāda Literature</title>, Kalyāṇamitra gives this text the title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lung gzhi’i ’grel pa</title> or <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Āgamavastuvṛtti</title> in the colophon (Martin,
                            2011: *Śubhamitra). None of the Degé, Choné, Kangxi, or Narthang editions of this commentary include a colophon; all of them end
                            abruptly after thirteen fascicles. In the commentary itself, however, Kalyāṇamitra refers to his work numerous times as the <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’dul ba gzhi rgya cher ’grel ba</title> and identifies himself as the <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sde ’dzin
                                pa dge legs bshes gnyen</foreign> (“the sūtra master Kalyāṇamitra”) at the end of his remarks on the second chapter. The lack of
                            a colophon prevents us from identifying the Tibetan translators who executed the translation and the Indian paṇḍitas who oversaw
                            it.</note> On the whole, Kalyāṇamitra’s citations mirror the relevant passages from the root text. However, there is enough
                        variation between the root text and his commentary—direct quotations purportedly from the root text which have no correlate in any of
                        the Tibetan redactions, important passages of the root text not glossed in the commentary, differences in key terms—to suggest
                        Kalyāṇamitra may have been working from a different edition of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> than that which was
                        available to the Tibetan translators and their Indian informants.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-99"> Such variance, common
                            when texts are transmitted in manuscript form, becomes less common with the adoption of block printing. Recent work by scholars such
                            as Shayne Clarke, Chistopher Emms, and Haiyan Hu-von Hinüber also points to the existence of multiple Mūlasarvāstivādin
                            transmissions, though the nature and extent of their differences is not yet clear. That said, the Tibetan translations of
                            Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary and the <title xml:lang="en">Chapter on Going Forth</title> show remarkable agreement, as do the Sanskrit
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> manuscripts uncovered in Gilgit and the Tibetan translation preserved in the
                            Kangyur.</note> And although it does not bear directly on the present work, it should also be noted that the Tibetan translation of
                        Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary appears to be incomplete. Presumably, Kalyāṇamitra commented on all seventeen chapters of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>, but the Degé, Coné, and Narthang editions of his commentary all end abruptly after the
                        thirteenth fascicle, four pages into his comments on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>’s third chapter, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pravāraṇāvastu</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-100"> The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> itself takes up nearly 2,500 pages over four volumes but, since the extant Tibetan translations of
                            Kalyāṇamitra’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastuṭīkā</title> are incomplete, it is not clear how long his commentary was in the
                            Sanskrit original. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastuṭīkā</title> begins with a detailed, word-by-word commentary on the first
                            chapter that is as long as the chapter itself, 261 pages. By contrast, the commentary on the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title>’s 180-page second chapter takes only 32 pages. Despite its brevity, Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary to the second
                            chapter is consistent with the material, the structure and terms of which are more straightforward and less diverse than the first
                            chapter. Kalyāṇamitra may have treated the other fifteen chapters as extensively as he did the first chapter or as cursorily as he
                            did the second; given the available material, it is impossible to say more.</note>

                            obstacle to that path and realization. Buddhas have abandoned five “branches” or factors that
                            perpetuate saṃsāra: pursuing desires, ill will, lethargy and languor, regret and agitation, and view
                            and doubt. Buddhas have transcended rebirth as a god, human, hell-realm being, animal, and spirit.
                            Buddhas are in possession of six “branches” of knowledge: knowledge of miraculous realms, the divine
                            ear, different states of mind, previous rebirths, birth and death, and the exhaustion of defilements.
                            To always abide by the six abodes means to always be aware of and attentive to the six objects of
                            visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental consciousness. The flower of awakening’s
                            seven branches are mindfulness, discernment, diligence, joy, pliancy, samādhi, and equanimity
                            (Kalyāṇamitra, F.217.b.6–218.b.2). Dungkar Rinpoche gives two similar lists of the seven treasures of
                            a noble being: (1) faith, ethics, generosity, learning, samaya, a conscience, and wisdom, and (2)
                            faith, ethics, learning, generosity, a conscience, propriety, and wisdom (dung dkar, 2002, 1370–71).
                            In his <title xml:lang="en">Gateway to Knowledge</title>, Mipham identifies three groups of three
                            thoughts that inspire aggression: (1–3) “the thoughts, ‘This has hurt me. This is hurting me. This
                            will hurt me.’; (4–6) the thoughts, ‘This has hurt someone dear to me. This is hurting someone dear to
                            me. This will hurt someone dear to me.’; and (7–9) the thoughts, ‘This has helped my enemy. This helps
                            my enemy. This will help my enemy’.” (Mi pham rgya mtsho, 1978, 74). The eight branches of the path
                            are right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
                            mindfulness, and right concentration. The nine stages of absorption are the four dhyānas, the four
                            formless-realm absorptions, and absorption in cessation. Kalyāṇamitra gives a list of nine strengths:
                            the strengths of knowing right from wrong; knowing one’s karma is one’s own doing; absorption in
                            concentration, liberation, and samādhi; knowing supreme faculties from those that are not; knowing the
                            range of dispositions; knowing the paths on which all tread; knowing and recollecting past rebirths;
                            knowing birth and death; and knowing the exhaustion of defilements (Kalyāṇamitra, F.218.b.2–218.b.6).
                            To these, one can add the tenth from a list given by Kawa Paltsek in his <title xml:lang="en">A
                                Mnemonic for Dharma Lists</title>, which follows Kalyāṇamitra’s in most other regards: The
                            strength of knowing the range of different inclinations (nor brang, 2008, 2180–81). </note>-->

                                    more expressive of a sense of general bereavement and grievance directed towards the Buddha himself, which the monks, by way

                                because neither valid perception nor valid inference sees a self as persisting into a future life. Perception cannot see it
                                because objects of perception must be “right in front of us,” which a future self, separated in time and space, cannot be. Nor
                                can inference see it because objects of inference must be abstractions, not “things” like the self. The Buddha’s response
                                suggests that Dīrghanakha’s view is nihilistic, for it holds that the self begins at birth and ends at death, thereby denying
                                continuity from life to life (Kalyāṇamitra, folio 224.a.4–6).</note>

                                            misdeeds), each of which must be expunged in its own way. Defeats cannot be expunged. Saṅgha remnants are expunged
                                            through confession to the community followed by a period of probation and penance. Transgressions are of two types,
                                            those requiring forfeiture and simple transgressions. Transgressions requiring forfeiture are expunged through
                                            communal confession and the forfeiting of the object that caused the offense. Simple transgressions are expunged
                                            through participation in the community’s restoration. Confessable offenses are expunged through personal confession
                                            while misdeeds are expunged through resolving to refrain from them in the future (see Dudjom, 1999). According to
                                            Kalyāṇamitra, slight mental misdeeds must be reined in; transgressions, and confessable offenses should be
                                            confessed; while saṅgha remnants and transgressions requiring forfeiture must be formally excused (Kalyāṇamitra,
                                            folio 244.a.4–7). </note> Recognizing those faults, they should make amends by resolving to restrain themselves,
                                        confessing them, or having them excused before taking their places.</p>

                                    lax and we became dissolute. When the ethical monks evicted us from the monastery, we took up in an empty monastery. After a
                                    while, an ethical monk happened by, which gave us an idea. We thought, ‘He alone can purify patronage.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-001-1841">Patronage (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">yon</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dakṣiṇā</foreign>) is an offering made in faith or in payment for ritual services. If
                                        a monk observes his vows purely, he may receive, and use, extensive patronage, as much as “one hundred thousand items of
                                        clothing, one hundred thousand dishes of food, and five hundred houses,” provided he receives it with “the thought of
                                        nirvaṇa” (Kalyāṇamitra, folio 296.b.6–7). However, if he is lax in his observance of his ethics, he is not entitled to
                                        patronage and the consequences of seeking it are dire. As the Buddha said in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavibhaṅga</title>, “For one without pure vows and whose ethics are lax, / It is far better / To eat fiery iron
                                        balls / Than alms collected from surrounding communities” (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">

                                    there, who then proceeded to evict us. Those of us who could not bear this piled wood, straw, and dried dung and set fire to

                            kept as apprentices anyone whose going forth had been allowed and who had been ordained, but who could not recognize a rogue. Once
                            the apprentices could recognize a rogue, they were entrusted as apprentices to monks of good standing. On the advice of the Teacher,
                            they would on occasion simply look in on their apprentices. </p>

                                <p>A stylized way to say that a person or group may govern itself and is not subject to the “law of the land.” The Buddhist
                                    saṅgha enjoyed such autonomy. The analogy means the king granted sovereignty to the saṅgha, which was then allowed to govern
                                    itself and was not subject to the law of the land. The legal exemption members of the saṅgha enjoyed made it an attractive
                                    sanctuary for those on the run from their masters, debt collectors, and the law, who would join the saṅgha for legal rather
                                    than spiritual reasons. “From ancient times the legal tradition recognized the right of properly constituted groups to
                                    formulate their own laws” (Olivelle, 1993, 209).</p>

                                <p>In “The Chapter on Going Forth,” Kalyāṇamitra reads this as an abbreviation of “refuge instructor” (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gnas kyi slob dpon</foreign>). A “refuge” or “refuge monk” is one who has passed ten years as a monk
                                    and possesses five qualities and is thus fit to guide new monks, grant ordination, and instruction. In “The Chapter on Going
                                    Forth,” the Buddha says a monk who has been ordained five years may be considered “independent” enough to travel
                                    independently between monsoons. Though the text does not address the issue, a monk of five years ordination would not, in
                                    ordinary circumstances, acts as a refuge instructor.</p>

                                    </foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ma ning</foreign>) encompasses diverse physiological and behavioral
                                    conditions, such as intersexuality, erectile dysfunction, and fetishes that imply an inability to engage in normative sexual
                                    behavior. Five different types of person labeled a paṇḍaka are identified in the text (see <ptr target="#UT22084-001-001-1616"/>): intersex persons, rhythmic-consecutive persons, sexually submissive persons, persons
                                    with a voyeuristic fetish, and persons with a sexual disability (see glossary entries for each). The criteria for being
                                    designated a person labeled a paṇḍaka are not strictly physiological, but neither are they grounded exclusively in gender
                                    identity or sexual orientation. <distinct>Person labeled a paṇḍaka</distinct> is, in effect, a catchall category and, as
                                    such, defies easy translations like “neuter,” “androgyne,” “intersexual,” “transgender,” or “paraphiliac.”</p>

                                <p>A place where the Buddha often resided, within the Bamboo Park (Veṇuvana) outside Rajagṛha that had been donated to him. The
                                    name is said to have arisen when, one day, King Bimbisāra fell asleep after a romantic liaison in the Bamboo Park. While the

                                    to the danger, who rushed back and hacked the snake to pieces, thereby saving the king’s life. King Bimbisāra then named the

                                <p>Kalyāṇamitra gives a list of nine strengths: the strengths of knowing right from wrong; knowing one’s karma is one’s own
                                    doing; absorption in concentration, liberation, and samādhi; knowing supreme faculties from those that are not; knowing the
                                    range of dispositions; knowing the paths on which all tread; knowing and recollecting past rebirths; knowing birth and
                                    death; and knowing the exhaustion of defilements (Kalyāṇamitra, folios 218.b.2–218.b.6). To these, one can add the tenth
                                    from a list given by Kawa Paltsek in his <title xml:lang="en">A Mnemonic for Dharma Lists</title>, which follows
                                    Kalyāṇamitra’s in most other regards: The strength of knowing the range of different inclinations (nor brang 2008, pp.
