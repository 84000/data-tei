                                                        appears in the Stok, Ulaanbaatar, Shey, Hemis, Phugbrag, Namgyal, Chizhi, Dongkarla, Gangteng, and
                                                        Neyphug Kangyurs and the Basgo fragments, while the former title appears in the rest.</note>
                                        provides a teaching on the subject of the appropriate conduct for bodhisattvas. Taking place in the Jeta Grove, on the
                                        outskirts of Śrāvastī, the sūtra is framed primarily as a conversation between the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī and a number of
                                        senior monks and gods, while the Buddha listens to their dialog and occasionally comments. These monks and gods pose a
                                        series of questions to Mañjuśrī as to how bodhisattvas should conduct themselves properly and avoid the negative
                                        influence of Māra. While these questions generally deal with basic tenets of Buddhism and monastic conduct, Mañjuśrī’s
                                        answers prioritize intention and proper view over actions themselves.</p>

                                <p tid="8">Midway through the text, the evil demon Māra makes an appearance in the form of a dark cloud (<ptr target="#UT22084-046-003-117"/>). He is caught and bound by
                                        Mañjuśrī, who transforms him into a propagator of the Buddha’s teaching. In the section that follows, Māra unwillingly
                                        responds to questions from elder members of the sangha concerning proper conduct as well as the bodhisattva path. At the
                                        end of this section, the god Susīma requests Mañjuśrī to free Māra (<ptr target="#UT22084-046-003-162"/>). Mañjuśrī responds by saying that Māra was never
                                        physically bound, just as beings are not truly bound by suffering either. In fact, both can be liberated by
                                        understanding the empty nature of their perceived bonds. Following this section, Mañjuśrī resumes answering questions
                                        related to the bodhisattva path posed by various gods.</p>

                                <p tid="9">Throughout the sūtra, conventional aspects of the Buddhist path, from generosity and discipline to insight and wisdom, are
                                        framed within an understanding of the empty nature of phenomena. In response to questions about the most appropriate
                                        conduct, Mañjuśrī teaches that the primary concern must be the proper view, rather than physical actions. Likewise,
                                        while Māra is bound by Mañjuśrī’s power, he explains to the elder Upāli that upholding monastic discipline is dependent
                                        upon understanding the empty nature of phenomena. Although the sūtra teaches that the view of ultimate truth is
                                        paramount, it also makes clear that bodhisattvas must engage with beings on the conventional level for the sake of
                                        helping others. In this way, skillful means and insight, which are so central to the path of the Mahāyāna, are
                                        united.</p>

                                                together with a great monastic assembly of 1,250 monks. Also in attendance was a great assembly of bodhisattvas,

                                                Great Light asked youthful Mañjuśrī, “Mañjuśrī, when Māra creates obstacles to the bodhisattvas’ unexcelled and
                                                perfect awakening, then, Mañjuśrī, what are the workings of Māra with respect to bodhisattvas?” </p>

                                        <p tid="19">Youthful Mañjuśrī replied to the god Great Light, “Divine being, as long as there are actions, there are the workings
                                                of Māra. As long as there are aspirations, misapprehensions, or valuations, there are the workings of Māra. As

                                                divine being, clinging to the mind of awakening is the working of Māra. Clinging to an attitude of generosity is
                                                the working of Māra. Clinging to thoughts of discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, and insights are
                                                also the workings of Māra. <ref cRef="F.242.b" type="folio"/> Being arrogant about generosity, esteeming discipline, grasping at
                                                patience, adopting diligence, practicing concentration with marks, and having discursive insight are also the
                                                workings of Māra. Liking and wishing for the wilderness and falling into indifference are also the workings of
                                                Māra. Entertaining assumptions about having few desires, being content, engaging in ascetic practices, and
                                                reducing one’s possessions are also the workings of Māra. To have assumptions and presumptions, such as ‘I abide

                                                arising of faults and are no longer so strict. Since they can overcome even the acts with immediate retribution,
                                                there is no need to mention minor wrongdoings related to behavior and discipline. As such, they accomplish
                                                proper Dharma conduct. They are experts at taming the afflictions. They perceive that temporary afflictions are
                                                not defiled, and that they arise. They do not teach afflictions as being inside, outside, or neither. They know
                                                that such an understanding of the afflictions is to know their nonexistence, so they do not try to eliminate
                                                them or make them disappear. Rather, they know all afflictions to be like clouds, in that they use the wind of

                                                remain. They know that afflictions are like the moon in water, in that they show their faces through the
                                                reflections of superimpositions. They know that afflictions are like a dark realm, such that they use the
                                                lantern of wisdom to illuminate the darkness. They know that afflictions are like thieves, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ḍākinīs</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yakṣas</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">rākṣasas</foreign>, in that if one investigates
                                                properly, they do not remain. They know that afflictions always exploit our vulnerabilities, in that they
                                                proliferate with improper mental engagement. <ref cRef="F.251.b" type="folio"/> They know that, through the knowledge of emptiness, the

                                                knows afflictions to be as such has compassion for beings tormented by afflictions, and they clearly perceive
                                                that there is no self and no being. When this has occurred, they are known as true upholders of the Vinaya.”</p>

                                                bodhisattvas. What are those twenty? (1) Pleasing, serving, and venerating those practitioners who seek
                                                liberation and fear saṃsāra are the workings of Māra. (2) Contemplating emptiness, yet forsaking beings, is the
                                                working of Māra. (3) Contemplating the unconditioned, yet being weary of conditioned roots of virtue, is the
                                                working of Māra. (4) Generating concentration, yet attempting to turn away from concentration, is the working of
                                                Māra. (5) Teaching the Dharma, yet not having great compassion for the audience, is also the working of Māra.
                                                (6) Searching for those who have qualities and who are worthy of generosity, while harboring anger toward those
                                                who are immoral, is the working of Māra. (7) Teaching the discourses of the hearers and solitary buddhas, while
                                                concealing the teachings of the Great Vehicle, is the working of Māra. (8) Hiding the profound discourses, while
                                                teaching various other topics, is the working of Māra. (9) Knowing the path of the bodhisattvas, <ref cRef="F.252.a" type="folio"/> yet
                                                not striving on the path of the perfections, is also the working of Māra. (10) Praising those who are
                                                particularly diligent, while not coaxing beings who are not diligent, is also the working of Māra. (11) Not
                                                actualizing the mind of awakening, despite having accumulated roots of virtue, is also the working of Māra. (12)
                                                Preventing others from grasping special insight, despite practicing special insight oneself, is also the working
                                                of Māra. (13) Seeking to terminate afflictions entirely, while aspiring for the afflictions in the continuation
                                                of saṃsāra, is also the working of Māra. (14) Using insight for analysis, while not maintaining one’s focus on
                                                great compassion, is also the working of Māra. (15) Any virtuous act that is performed unskillfully is also the
                                                working of Māra. (16) Not seeking the bodhisattva teachings, but rather, receiving the secret words of the
                                                        <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">lokāyatas</foreign>, is also the working of Māra. (17) Being

                                                working of Māra. (18) Working on worldly affairs without seeking erudition is also the working of Māra. (19)
                                                Failing to follow, serve, and venerate fellow bodhisattva Dharma teachers who practice the Great Vehicle, while

                                                working of Māra. (20) When one has attained the greatness of resources, wealth, jewels, and power of Śakra,
