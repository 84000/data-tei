                                <p tid="2">In this scripture the Buddha Śākyamuni travels miraculously from Rājagṛha with a large retinue of bodhisattvas, hearers,
                                        gods, and other beings to the Central Asian region of Khotan, which in this discourse has not yet been established as a
                                        kingdom but is covered by a great lake. Once there, the Buddha foretells how this will be the site of a future land
                                        called <term>Virtue</term>, which will contain a blessed stūpa called Gomasalaganda. The Buddha proceeds to explain to his retinue
                                        the excellent qualities of this land, foretelling many future events, and instructing his disciples how to guard and
                                        protect the land for the sake of beings at that time. At the end of his teaching, the Buddha asks the hearer Śāriputra
                                        and the divine king Vaiśravaṇa to drain the lake, thus diverting the water and rendering the land ready for future
                                        habitation.</p>

                                                canonical texts in the form of prophecies that furnish Khotan with its Buddhist founding mythology. While other
                                                texts (detailed below) relate how the Buddha prophesied key figures in Khotan’s founding, rule, and protection,
                                                this sūtra provides an account of how the Buddha also established and blessed the landscape itself and other

                                      and their eventual decline. Whereas in many sūtras the term “prophecy” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vyākaraṇa</foreign>, 
                                      which can also mean “revelation” or simply “explanation”) is used in the specific sense of the Buddha predicting the 
                                      future awakening to buddhahood of a particular individual, in the titles of a few texts like the present one it refers to

                                                through the sky from Rājagṛha in India to Khotan, which in this discourse has not yet been established as a
                                                country and at the outset remains covered by a giant lake. Once there, the Buddha visits the lakeshore and the
                                                nearby Mount Gośṛṅga. Gośṛṅga means “cow horn” in Sanskrit and the hill is said to have received this name due
                                                to having two pointed peaks. From the top of Mount Gośṛṅga the Buddha foretells how this will be the site of a

                                                the sūtra describes Khotan as a contested wilderness region sought after by various foreign powers, it foretells
                                                a time when the area will gain peace, prosperity, and protection under the governance of Tibetan and Chinese
                                                Buddhist kingdoms. At the time of Xuanzang’s visit, not very long before the first Tibetan invasion of the
                                                country, it is unlikely that any Tibetan governance would have been foreseen as either Buddhist or benevolent.
                                                If the sūtra itself existed in some earlier form during the first half of the seventh century when the Buddhist
                                                rulers of Khotan were clinging to power in the face of rising threats from neighboring foreign powers, including
                                                Tibet and China, it is likely to have been adapted later to cast Tibet in a more favorable light. Any dating
                                                must therefore remain speculative in the absence of corroborating evidence. </p>

                                                that focus on the spread, duration, and eventual decline of the Buddha’s teachings, and have sometimes been
                                                termed “prophecies of decline” or “prophetic histories.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-011-28"> For an account of the Buddhist
                                                        “prophetic history” literature, including an analysis of the Khotanese texts mentioned here, see Nattier
                                                        1991. One common feature is reference to the canonical Kauśāmbī story of decline following sectarian
                                                        rivalry after foreign invasion. 
                                                        The present sūtra makes no such reference and is less focused on decline than 
                                                        the other Khotanese texts, making it something of an outlier.</note> Many of them
                                                include the term “prophecy” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign>) in their title, but
                                                unlike the majority of “prophecy” sūtras in which an individual’s future awakening to buddhahood in another
                                                realm is proclaimed, the prophecies in this group of texts are concerned with broader events in this world, may
                                                contain warnings and advice on how to avoid the most negative outcomes, and recount events that may range from
                                                the mythical to the historical. Curiously, mentions of Khotan feature in texts of this genre more frequently
                                                than might be expected from its relatively modest historical profile, and the Khotan texts make up a substantial
                                                portion of the group, suggesting that the theme may have been especially popular in Central Asia. 
                                                One example of the genre that references Khotan but was probably not translated from a Khotanese source is the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sūrya­garbha-mahā­vaipulya­sūtra</title> (Toh 257), which briefly tells the

                                                just a single day after going forth. Why is that? Because all of the buddhas, who are equal in number to the
                                                grains of sand in the Ganges River, have first given up their life as householders and gone forth, and attained

                                        <p tid="86">The Blessed One replied in a voice like that of Brahmā, “Mañjuśrī, these gateways of Dharma, which yield great
                                                blessings, were taught for the benefit of those who are to be born in the land of <term>Virtue</term> and for the benefit of
                                                the fourfold retinue. Through these gateways of Dharma, bodhisattvas will purify their faculties and
                                                consciousness with only a little hardship and a little effort and they will come to directly realize these
                                                gateways of Dharma. Beings of the future, from young children upward, will take joy in the realization of the
                                                Dharma and they will talk about these gateways of Dharma even in their games. Such sentient beings, by
                                                developing their faculties in this way, will purify the eye of Dharma and will thereby behold the bodies of the
                                                thus-gone ones. Purifying the ear of Dharma, they will hear and receive the Dharma. Their minds will be freed
                                                from all the formations and phenomena in saṃsāra. With such minds, they will exert themselves in virtue here in
                                                this blessed wilderness, or they will live on Mount Gośṛṅga and will all gain realization there. Evil Māra
                                                himself will be unable to harm them, let alone anyone else. It is like this. Even if the gods were to penalize
                                                and punish the retinues of yakṣas, gandharvas, or kinnaras, if these beings were to take shelter at the

                                                them, their minds would become peaceful. For this reason, Mount Gośṛṅga and the Gomasalaganda stūpa are an
