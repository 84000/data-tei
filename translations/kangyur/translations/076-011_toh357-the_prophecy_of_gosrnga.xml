                        Buddha travels miraculously through the sky from Rājagṛha in India to Khotan, which in this
                        discourse has not yet been established as a country and at the outset remains covered by a giant
                        lake. Once there, the Buddha visits the lakeshore and the nearby Mount Gośṛṅga. Gośṛṅga means
                        “cow horn” in Sanskrit and the hill is said to have received this name due to having two pointed
                        peaks. From the top of Mount Gośṛṅga the Buddha foretells how this will be the site of a future
                        Buddhist land called <term>Virtue</term>, which will contain a stūpa known as Gomasalaganda and
                        a range of other sacred temples and monuments. The Buddha continues to explain to his retinue
                        the excellent qualities of this land, foretelling many future events, and instructing his
                        disciples how to guard and protect the land for the sake of beings at that time. At the end of
                        the discourse, the Buddha instructs the great hearer Śāriputra and the divine king Vaiśravaṇa to
                        drain the lake’s water by using their miraculous powers to crush one of the surrounding
                        mountains, thus diverting the water and rendering the land ready for future inhabitants.</p>

                        Khotan. Khotan was invaded by the Tibetans around the mid-seventh century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> at a time when, during the reigns of Songtsen Gampo and his successors, Tibetan
                        political and military power were expanding. Khotanese accounts of the time saw the arrival of
                        the Tibetans as destructive of Buddhist institutions there, and although the Tibetan court had
                        recently begun to adopt Buddhist culture it is likely that its influence had not yet reached the

                        form of the Indo-European language family that developed from the vernacular of the region and,
                        written in Brāhmī script, was used in Khotan for Buddhist texts from the sixth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> onward.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-011-18"> In earlier

                        describes Khotan as a contested wilderness region sought after by various foreign powers, it
                        foretells a time when the area will gain peace, prosperity, and protection under the governance
                        of Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist kingdoms. At the time of Xuanzang’s visit, not very long before
                        the first Tibetan invasion of the country, it is unlikely that any Tibetan governance would have
                        been foreseen as either Buddhist or benevolent. If the sūtra itself existed in some earlier form
                        during the first half of the seventh century when the Buddhist rulers of Khotan were clinging to
                        power in the face of rising threats from neighboring foreign powers, including Tibet and China,
                        it is likely to have been adapted later to cast Tibet in a more favorable light. Any dating must
                        therefore remain speculative in the absence of corroborating evidence. </p>

                        history and links them to the Buddha’s lifetime in India. The princess Vimalaprabhā, bodhisattva
                        daughter of King Ajātaśatru of Magadha, receives a detailed prophecy of her future lives as a
                        series of important and powerful female figures in Khotan, and especially one life as the
                        formidable lady Rabngé—sister of the king of one neighboring country, widow of the king of
                        another, Buddhist nun, and protectress of Khotan. Also related to Khotan are two texts found in

                        of a wider group of texts that focus on the spread, duration, and eventual decline of the
                        Buddha’s teachings, and have sometimes been termed “prophecies of decline” or “prophetic
                            histories.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-011-28"> For an account of the Buddhist
                            “prophetic history” literature, including an analysis of the Khotanese texts mentioned here,
                            see Nattier 1991. One common feature is reference to the canonical Kauśāmbī story of decline
                            following sectarian rivalry after foreign invasion. The present sūtra makes no such
                            reference and is less focused on decline than the other Khotanese texts, making it something
                            of an outlier.</note> Many of them include the term “prophecy” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign>) in their title, but unlike the majority of “prophecy”
                        sūtras in which an individual’s future awakening to buddhahood in another realm is proclaimed,
                        the prophecies in this group of texts are concerned with broader events in this world, may
                        contain warnings and advice on how to avoid the most negative outcomes, and recount events that
                        may range from the mythical to the historical. Curiously, mentions of Khotan feature in texts of
                        this genre more frequently than might be expected from its relatively modest historical profile,
                        and the Khotan texts make up a substantial portion of the group, suggesting that the theme may
                        have been especially popular in Central Asia. One example of the genre that references Khotan

                        have contributed significantly to the corresponding mythology of the Kathmandu valley, as

                        from various other places, the gods and nāgas living on the earth, and the celestial gods and
                        yakṣas, were all filled with wonder and rapture and they gained confidence in those sounds of
                        gateways of Dharma. </p>

                    <p tid="85">In order to facilitate their understanding, the bodhisattva great being
                        Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, for what purpose was this great
                        miracle displayed?”</p>

                    <p tid="86">The Blessed One replied in a voice like that of Brahmā, “Mañjuśrī, these gateways of
                        Dharma, which yield great blessings, were taught for the benefit of those who are to be born in
                        the land of <term>Virtue</term> and for the benefit of the fourfold retinue. Through these
                        gateways of Dharma, bodhisattvas will purify their faculties and consciousness with only a
                        little hardship and a little effort and they will come to directly realize these gateways of
                        Dharma. Beings of the future, from young children upward, will take joy in the realization of
                        the Dharma and they will talk about these gateways of Dharma even in their games. Such sentient
                        beings, by developing their faculties in this way, will purify the eye of Dharma and will
                        thereby behold the bodies of the thus-gone ones. Purifying the ear of Dharma, they will hear and
                        receive the Dharma. Their minds will be freed from all the formations and phenomena in saṃsāra.
                        With such minds, they will exert themselves in virtue here in this blessed wilderness, or they
                        will live on Mount Gośṛṅga and will all gain realization there. Evil Māra himself will be unable
                        to harm them, let alone anyone else. It is like this. Even if the gods were to penalize and
                        punish the retinues of yakṣas, gandharvas, or kinnaras, if these beings were to take shelter at
                        the Gomasalaganda stūpa and Mount Gośṛṅga, the gods would be unable to see them. Even if they
                        should happen to see them, their minds would become peaceful. For this reason, Mount Gośṛṅga and
                        the Gomasalaganda stūpa are an asylum, <ref cRef="F.232.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-076-011-269"/> a sanctuary, and a haven. They are worthy of homage by beings
                        living in other worlds. Simply to feel faith upon hearing the names of the Gomasalaganda stūpa,
                        Mount Gośṛṅga, the land of <term>Virtue</term>, Virtuous Castle, and the blessed hermitages will
                        purify grave misdeeds.”</p>

                        Śāriputra held in his hand a staff and Vaiśravaṇa held a spear, and with these they cleaved Sha
                        Mountain into two, picked up the pieces, and placed them down in the west. Thus, they created a

                        Gyisho River<!-- Tsangpo-->. In this manner, the Gomasalaganda stūpa, Mount Gośṛṅga, and the
