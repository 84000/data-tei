                    <title xml:lang="en">The Inquiry of the Girl Sumati</title> features an
                    eight-year-old girl named Sumati, “Keen Intellect,” who asks the Buddha
                    Śākyamuni a series of questions about what is necessary to gain a variety of
                    positive outcomes, like a beautiful body and an auspicious, peaceful death. The
                    Buddha replies by expounding a series of sets of four dharmas that a bodhisattva
                    can cultivate to produce these outcomes. Sumati then promises to put them all
                    into practice exactly as he has taught them. Her confidence prompts
                    Maudgalyāyana and Mañjuśrī to question her motives and understanding. She
                    responds with several acts of truth that confirm her aspiration to achieve
                    awakening as a buddha and result in several wonders, including a great
                    earthquake. Sumati’s dialogue with Mañjuśrī explores the nature of reality and
                    the reality of gender, among other topics, and leads Sumati to transform herself
                    into a man and confirm the conditions of her future awakening as a buddha. The
                    Buddha then himself confirms not only her future awakening but also that of
                    several monks in the audience.</p>

                        reader encounters a young girl named Sumati, whose name means “keen
                        intellect.” Throughout the sūtra, Sumati demonstrates her intelligence,
                        maturity, and confidence. She first approaches the Buddha Śākyamuni while he
                        is residing with a large assembly of monks and bodhisattvas on Vulture Peak
                        near Rājagṛha. She asks him a series of questions about how to gain various
                        advantages, all of which are described as outcomes of the practices of a
                        bodhisattva. These include physical beauty, wealth, a united community,
                        spontaneous rebirth in a pure buddha domain in the presence of a buddha,
                        superhuman powers with which to travel to other buddha domains, and
                        obtaining a peaceful, auspicious moment of death. </p>

                        prose and verse in which he outlines various sets of four dharmas, with the

                        understands the gravity of her undertaking, which prompts Sumati to perform
                        an “act of truth”, a kind of wondrous demonstration found in Indian and
                        Buddhist literature whereby the truth of a statement produces a miracle or

                        Sumati responds to Mañjuśrī’s questions with a deep understanding of the
                        nature of reality. During the conversation, the Buddha informs Mañjuśrī that
                        Sumati had been Mañjuśrī’s own teacher in a past life and had introduced him
                        to the fact that things do not arise in truth. This elicits Mañjuśrī’s
                        respect, but then he wonders why she is still female, which prompts Sumati
                        to state, in effect, that male and female are nothing more than concepts
                        with no objective basis in reality, and then she performs another act of
                        truth whereby she transforms herself into an adult male monk.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-011-57"> The deliberate transformation
                            of sex, as described in this and a number of other sūtras, has been the
                            subject of several scholarly studies. Two early studies are Paul 1979
                            (especially chapter 5), and Schuster 1981. Other discussions include
                            those found in Peach 2002 and Young 2007. On Buddhist attitudes toward
                            women and sexuality, more generally and in classical South Asia, one may
                            also consult the collection edited by Cabezón 1992 and Cabezón’s

                        Sumati that serves to describe and confirm the conditions in which she will
                        attain awakening as a buddha in the future. That she will do so is given
                        further confirmation by the Buddha, who also gives prophecies of future

                        Sumati’s example to dedicate their own merit to becoming buddhas. The sūtra

                        audience to remember the sūtra, to recite it, to copy it, and to teach it to

                            only a difference of two syllables from Pratibhānālaṅkāra, which would
                            be the hypothetical reconstruction of the Sanskrit name from the Tibetan
                            translation. Bodhiruci’s Chinese translation (Taishō 310 and 336) has
                            辯才莊嚴 (“Adornment of Eloquence”), which matches the Tibetan. By contrast,
                            Dharmarakṣa’s much earlier translation (Taishō 334) has 莊飾預知人意
                            (“Adornment Foreseeing People’s Thoughts”), a name that appears with
                            only slight variation in Kumārajīva’s subsequent translation (Taishō
                            335), which reads 莊飾豫知人意 and translates the same way (“Adornment
                            Foreseeing People’s Thoughts”). It may be that the name in the Sanskrit
                            bears some correlation to the earlier Chinese translations, but this is
