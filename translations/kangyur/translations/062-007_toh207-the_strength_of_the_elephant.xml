                                        emptiness of all phenomena, also known as transcendent insight. Following
                                        a short teaching in verse by Śāriputra, the Buddha delivers 
                                        the primary discourse at the behest of Ānanda and Mañjuśrī amid a 
                                        vast assembly of monks, bodhisattvas, and lay 
                                        devotees. He specifically addresses hearers and so-called “outcast
                                        bodhisattvas” who have not realized transcendent insight and who thus 
                                        remain attached to phenomenal appearances. Responding to a series of
                                        questions posed by Mañjuśrī and Śāriputra, the Buddha explains that all 
                                        phenomena are as empty as space, with nothing to be either affirmed or
                                        rejected. Yet that very emptiness is what makes everything possible, including 
                                        the bodhisattvas’ altruistic activities. </p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Strength of the Elephant</title> is set on Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain where the Buddha presides
                                                over a large assembly of monks and bodhisattvas. One afternoon, after the Buddha is addressed by 
                                                Śāradvatīputra with a brief discourse on the empty nature of all phenomena, he convenes a large audience
                                                of monks, bodhisattvas, and people from the city of Rājagṛha to share Śāradvatīputra’s insight. The Buddha
                                                proceeds to inform Mañjuśrī and the others that previous buddhas have also taught this Dharma discourse on
                                                transcendent insight, which is “like the strength of the elephant,” on Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, the very place
                                                where their assembly is gathered. At the request of Ānanda, the Buddha gives a series of
                                                teachings, in the form of replies to questions posed by Mañjuśrī, that concern the most beneficial,
                                                though often counterintuitive, forms of knowledge and activities characteristic of bodhisattvas who have
                                                realized emptiness. </p>
                                        <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-062-007-2"/>
                                        <p tid="8">A number of “arrogant monks” in the assembly, however, misunderstand the Tathāgata’s teaching and the Buddha is asked
                                                to clarify the intentions behind this discourse. Upon hearing his explanations, realization dawns in the minds
                                                of the various listeners and the monks affirm their new understanding. Mañjuśrī then inquires into the training
                                                in transcendent insight and the Buddha responds with a concluding teaching on the value and efficacy of this
                                                Dharma discourse. He describes twenty laudable qualities that are possessed by those who have faith in it. He
                                                also recounts how in a previous lifetime he himself became accomplished in it. The Buddha then gives
                                                instructions on the practices of bodhisattvas who wish to realize this profound insight. In the end, the Buddha
                                                commands Ānanda to remember it, and everybody rejoices and praises the Buddha’s words.</p>

                                        <p tid="10">The sūtra repeatedly draws attention to the empty
                                                and thus illusory nature of all phenomena, which includes everything from sensory appearances up to central
                                                Buddhist conceptions such as the six perfections, monastic discipline, morality, merit, and even the Buddha
                                                himself. The realization of this empty and illusory nature of all phenomena is transcendent insight, which
                                                allows one to rest naturally in a state of absorption. Phenomena as well as transcendent insight are said to be
                                                like space: “Space is not something to be realized, nor is it something to be abandoned. Likewise, no phenomenon
                                                is something to be realized or abandoned.” Because of this empty nature of phenomena, all conceptions about them
                                                as substantial or real are completely mistaken. To realize this is to correctly understand emptiness.</p>

                                        <p tid="11">Bodhisattvas accomplish a
                                                wide range of compassionate activities without departing from the profound insight of emptiness, which is
                                                transcendent insight. In this way, bodhisattvas are able to compassionately engage in the different realms of
                                                beings without disregarding their empty nature. Through such practices as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samādhi</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> recitation, they are able

                                        <p tid="12">This sūtra emphasizes that transcendent insight and the
                                                illusory nature of phenomena are difficult to understand for ordinary beings, hearers, solitary realizers, and
                                                bodhisattvas who cling to phenomenal appearances. Those who are unaware of the Tathāgata’s intention behind this
                                                teaching are in danger of completely misunderstanding him. The upshot of this observation is that all
                                                conceptions, even that concerning the Tathāgata, are false, and thus all views are mistaken. This applies not
                                                only to metaphysical views of a self, a being, a soul, and a person, but to conceptions such as “me” or “mine”
                                                and preconceptions such as Buddha, Dharma, and Saṇgha. </p>

                                        <p tid="13">One noteworthy feature of this sūtra is its outspoken
                                                condemnation of the shortcomings of “outcast bodhisattvas.” Such bodhisattvas are practitioners who reside in
                                                remote places but have failed to realize transcendent insight and remain attached to their disciplined
                                                practices. Those outcast bodhisattvas will consequently look down on other bodhisattvas who dwell near a village
                                                or town. Such passages may be understood as a criticism targeting “the susceptibility of forest monks to pride
                                                and conceit,”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-007-7" index="1"> Boucher 2009, p. 56.</note> which accords with the

                                                According to Monier-Williams’s Sanskrit dictionary, the compound <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">hastikakṣya</foreign> 
                                                may have the meaning of “lion” or “tiger.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-007-29" index="18"> It is unlikely that this meaning was intended by this sūtra’s title, although it
                                                                worth noting that, in the text, Vajradhvaja’s teacher is named Siṃhavikrāntagati.</note>
                                                Next, let us look at the individual members of the compound: <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">hasti</foreign> and 
                                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kakṣya</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Hasti</foreign> stands in 
                                                the compound for <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">hastin</foreign>, which can clearly be established as meaning “elephant.” 
                                                The second member, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kakṣya</foreign>, however, has a whole range of possible meanings.
                                                Monier-Williams notes them as “abiding in shrubs or dry grass,” “well fed,” “girth (of an animal),” “the
                                                enclosure of an edifice,” “similarity,” and “effort, exertion.” The Tibetan translation of this member (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rtsal</foreign>) carries similar meanings, but tends more toward meanings
                                                such as “skill,” “dexterity,” “potency,” “capacity,” “potential,” or “power.”</p>

                                        <p tid="22">Unfortunately, the sūtra itself does not give any really convincing pointers to the correct interpretation of its
                                                title, since references to both elephants (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">hasti</foreign>) and their
                                                supposed strength (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kakṣya</foreign>) are few. Toward the beginning of the
                                                sūtra, Śāradvatīputra declines the Buddha’s initial request to assemble the monks and bodhisattvas in the area
                                                by stating that “elephants are difficult to please (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mgu
                                                        ba</foreign>, ‘satisfy, content, please, convince’).” Toward the end of the sūtra, the Buddha
                                                recounts to Ānanda that “beings who yearn for this Dharma discourse will be subdued by the strength of the bull
                                                or the strength of the elephant.” Based on these elements, we decided to translate the title as “The Strength of the Elephant,” although we are aware that further research would be necessary to validate this
                                                reading.</p>

                                                studies with direct or indirect reference to the sūtra’s contents and development. Chen (2012) addresses newly
                                                identified fragments of a Khotanese translation of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hasti­kakṣya­sūtra</title>
                                                together with their Chinese parallels. Liu and Chen (2014) include a translation of a Sanskrit fragment of the
                                                        <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hasti­kakṣya­sūtra</title> in light of its Chinese and Tibetan parallels as well
                                                as a lengthy discussion of all title variants and their possible Sanskrit equivalents. Their study looks at the
                                                early development of Mahayāna sūtras and also includes a concordance of the contents found in the different
                                                translations. James Apple (2014) considers the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hasti­kakṣya­sūtra</title> from the
                                                perspective of his research on the historical developments of entrusted transmissions of written texts in India
                                                after the fourth century. In the process, he compares the textual differences between the Tibetan translation
                                                and the earlier and later Chinese translations of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hasti­kakṣya­sūtra</title>.
                                                Regarding the narrative variants of the story of Victory Banner of the Vajra told by the Buddha toward the end
                                                of the sūtra, Apple points out that the Dharma discourse is passed on as a Dharma scripture in the Tibetan
                                                version, but in the earlier Chinese versions of Dharmarakṣa and Dharmamitra it is said to be passed on as a
                                                mantra or a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign> respectively. </p>

                                        Consequently, Mañjuśrī thought to himself, “I will ask the Tathāgata <ref cRef="F.98.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-062-007-336"/> what is this profound discourse that is

                                        accomplish their tasks and also maintain all virtuous qualities. What are these six? If bodhisattvas practice
                                        generosity, then although they are benefactors who let go of all their possessions, they do not regard themselves as
                                        having completely reversed miserly behavior. Although they observe discipline, they not consider themselves as being
                                        beyond actions that result from inferior discipline. Although they possess patience and determination, they do not

                                        they do not exert themselves bodily or mentally. Although they are skilled in all concentrations, liberations,
                                        absorptions, and all meditative states, they are not stuck in a one-pointed mental state. Although they exist within the
                                        domain of insight, they regard themselves as not being fully liberated from transmigration. Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattvas

                                        assert selfhood, beings, life forms, and persons. However, Śāriputra, one should not consider noble beings to be those
                                        who engage in generosity, but rather those who are free from attachment and who turn away from generosity. Śāriputra, it
                                        may be illustrated as follows: When farmers have planted barley seeds in a field, husks, stalks, and leaves are produced
                                        from the barley. In that case, Śāriputra, do you think that the husks, stalks, and leaves are the fruits produced by the

                                        barley. Likewise, when noble beings practice generosity, great resources come to them with little difficulty. In
                                        addition, all fruits resulting from craving for the exhaustion of afflictions wither. <ref cRef="F.103.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-062-007-346"/> It may be illustrated as
                                        follows: Those who want barley think, ‘This is not the fruits of these barely seeds, nor is this the ears of barley
                                        produced by those seeds.’ As a consequence, they are neither pleased by the husks nor delighted by the stalks and
                                        leaves. Likewise, it should not be taught that practicing generosity in the field of the unconditioned gives a result
                                        that is conditioned. Śāriputra, according to this discourse, generosity brings neither great result nor great benefit

                                        pacifies all diseases. Why? Because, Mañjuśrī, countless eons in the past, a tathāgata, a worthy one, a complete and
                                        perfect buddha called Walking Like a Lion appeared in the world. <ref cRef="F.108.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-062-007-356"/> From afar, he expounded this Dharma discourse
                                        to many hundreds of thousands of beings. At that time, he summoned and included in his retinue a bodhisattva called
                                        Victory Banner of the Vajra, who heard this Dharma discourse from that tathāgata. Thereupon, with a mind free from
                                        distraction, doubt, or disbelief, he retained this Dharma discourse with its twenty laudable qualities and became
                                        accomplished in it. He came to possess the power of faith. He traveled to towns, villages, valleys, lands, provinces,
                                        and royal palaces where he proclaimed himself as a healer. Thereafter, thousands of beings tormented by various diseases
                                        swiftly arrived where the bodhisattva Victory Banner of the Vajra was staying so that he could save their lives. The
                                        bodhisattva, with a mind abiding in the power of faith, offered them this Dharma scripture. The mantra syllables of
                                        knowledge that arose from this Dharma discourse offered them protection, salvation, and assistance. </p>
