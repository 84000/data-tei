                                        Bimbisāra. Through instruction, pointed questioning, and a
                                        display of miracles, Mañjuśrī and his retinue of
                                        bodhisattvas show King Ajātaśatru that the remorse he feels
                                        for his crime is in fact unreal, just as all phenomena are
                                        unreal. The sūtra thus demonstrates Mañjuśrī’s superiority
                                        in wisdom and the profound purification that comes from
                                        realizing emptiness.</p>

                                                  Remorse</title> narrates how King Ajātaśatru,
                                                ruler of the ancient Indian kingdom of Magadha, is
                                                relieved of his remorse for having ruthlessly killed
                                                his father, King Bimbisāra. King Ajātaśatru and his
                                                relationship to the Buddha are frequently described
                                                in canonical Buddhist sources, where Ajātaśatru is
                                                often portrayed worshiping the Buddha and piously
                                                attending his teachings. Ajātaśatru indeed had a
                                                special reason for diligently participating in the
                                                religious life—due to his desire to assume the
                                                throne in Magadha, he had his father imprisoned and
                                                then starved him to death. Later, as he realized the
                                                impending negative consequences of his acts in terms
                                                of his future rebirths, King Ajātaśatru is portrayed
                                                as a man, overcome with remorse, who sought the
                                                healing counsel of the Buddha to remedy the unhappy
                                                destiny that otherwise surely awaited him. </p>

                                        <p tid="11">The sūtra begins with Mañjuśrī and a group of
                                                bodhisattvas and gods discussing the nature of
                                                omniscience. The bodhisattvas and gods articulate
                                                their own understandings of omniscience before
                                                Mañjuśrī offers a definitive explanation on the
                                                topic. Following this, he emanates a thus-gone one
                                                in the exact likeness of the Buddha Śākyamuni, who
                                                discusses the conduct of bodhisattvas and the
                                                emptiness of all phenomena. The sūtra then relays a
                                                story demonstrating the superiority of the
                                                bodhisattva path. Śākyamuni throws an alms bowl into
                                                the earth, down through innumerable buddha realms,
                                                and he asks some of his chief disciples, including
                                                Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, to find it, but they
                                                are unable to do so. Only the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī
                                                succeeds in reaching the alms bowl, which he does by
                                                means of a miraculous display. He is then
                                                acknowledged as having contributed to the awakening
                                                of various thus-gone ones, including Śākyamuni.</p>

                                                sūtra provides a detailed account of Ajātaśatru’s
                                                struggle to rectify his previous misdeeds,
                                                illustrating the profound benefits of obtaining
                                                insight into the nature of phenomena—an insight that
                                                can purify even the five so-called “<term ref="UT22084-062-016-580">acts with immediate results</term>” (patricide being one of them),
                                                which virtually guarantee rebirth in the hells
                                                immediately upon death. The task of teaching King
                                                Ajātaśatru is delegated by the Buddha to Mañjuśrī,
                                                who uses his superior insight into emptiness and his
                                                miraculous abilities to induce in King Ajātaśatru a
                                                degree of insight that can almost entirely purify
                                                the effects of his heinous deeds. Thus, the sūtra
                                                ends happily, despite the grave theme on which it is
                                                built.</p>

                                                included among the “Great Vehicle sūtras translated

                                                have been produced from the Sanskrit regardless, as
                                                Mañjuśrīgarbha and Ratnarakṣita are both known to
                                                have worked with Indian texts rather than Chinese
                                                  sources.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-016-21"> Herrmann-Pfandt 2008,

                                                or if perhaps the translation was indeed produced

                                                they merely note that the translation was edited by
                                                the Indian scholar Mañjuśrīgarbha<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-016-22"> The Tabo Kangyur

                                                perfect awakening. Why is this? Blessed One, if we

                                                afflictions are sameness. Thus, Great King,
                                                afflictions themselves are the path for anyone who
                                                realizes this. Why is this? Because one has
                                                understood afflictions in this way, afflictions will
                                                not arise . Furthermore, examining afflictions is
                                                itself the path.”</p>

                                                Collection? Noble sons, The Bodhisattva Collection
                                                is an immeasurable vessel. Noble sons, to draw an
                                                analogy, the immeasurable water in the vast ocean is
                                                the vessel for the limitless beings contained in the
                                                realms of nāgas, asuras, yakṣas, and animals.
                                                Likewise, noble sons, the Dharma teachings in The
                                                Bodhisattva Collection are an immeasurable vessel
                                                for hearing, discipline, absorption, insight, and
                                                wisdom vision. Noble sons, to draw an analogy,
                                                beings born within the vast ocean never drink any

                                                Likewise, noble sons, those who engage in the Dharma
                                                teachings within The Bodhisattva Collection do not
                                                drink any Dharma other than the fluid of
                                                omniscience. For this reason, it is called The
                                                Bodhisattva Collection. </p>

                                        <p tid="293">“Moreover, noble sons, there are three
                                                collections. What are the three? They are the
                                                collection of the hearers, the collection of the
                                                solitary buddhas, and the collection of the
                                                bodhisattvas. Noble sons, the collection of the
                                                hearers is attained by following the message of the
                                                far shore. In the collection of the solitary
                                                buddhas, causes are understood to be exhausted via
                                                the realization of dependent origination. Noble
                                                sons, The Bodhisattva Collection is the realization
                                                of immeasurable qualities in accord with
                                                self-occurring wisdom. Moreover, noble sons, the
                                                hearers and solitary buddhas do not in any way
                                                belong to the third collection. But, noble sons, the
                                                Dharma that is taught occurs through the three
                                                vehicles for the sake of those beings who belong to
                                                the vehicle of the hearers, the vehicle of the
                                                solitary buddhas, and unsurpassed and perfect
                                                awakening. This is what I proclaim to be the three
                                                collections. Noble sons, when bodhisattvas teach the
                                                Dharma, beings are taught according to the three
                                                vehicles. Therefore, bodhisattvas are said to
                                                possess all three collections. </p>

                                                threefold. What are the three parts? They are the
                                                training of the hearers, the training of the
                                                solitary buddhas, and the training of the
                                                bodhisattvas. Noble sons, in this regard, the

                                                their thoughts. The training of the solitary buddhas
                                                involves a middling degree of earnestness but no
                                                great compassion. Noble sons, the training of the
                                                bodhisattvas accords with the immeasurable. It is
                                                embraced by great compassion. Situated in the

                                                liberation is not taught in dualistic terms. The
                                                characteristic of the liberation of the thus-gone
                                                ones is the same as the characteristics of all
                                                phenomena, for the liberation of the thus-gone ones
                                                is free of characteristics. All phenomena are free
                                                from the characteristic of liberation, for any
                                                phenomenon that lacks characteristics also lacks
                                                liberation. In actual fact, their nonduality and
                                                their lack of mind and body is liberation. Mind and
                                                body cannot be liberated. Why is this? Because
                                                liberation is the nature of mind and body.

                                                extraneous, and this is why it is called

                                                characteristics because it rests in the gateway of

                                                great trichiliocosm were filled with bright light.
                                                The suffering of beings in the hell realms ceased,
                                                as did the suffering of beings in the animal realms
                                                and in the realms of Yama. The attachment,

                                                sorrow of every being was eliminated. At that
                                                moment, all beings regarded one another as parents
                                                and loved one another. All the worlds in the great

                                                like the palm of one’s hand. The road was paved with

                                                and jeweled railings were placed along both sides of
                                                the road. Pink, red, and white lotus flowers filled
                                                an area the width of seven chariots. Above the road
                                                were nets of jewels, which were draped with many
                                                silken tassels. Parasols, banners, standards, and
                                                pennants were erected. On both sides of the jeweled

                                                arrow shot. All the jeweled trees were connected
                                                with jeweled cords, and from each jeweled tree
                                                wafted a fragrance that filled the atmosphere for up
                                                to a league. Between every pair of jeweled trees
                                                emanated small ponds underlain by golden sand,

                                                made of beryl gems. The ponds were covered with
                                                blue, pink, red, and white lotuses, and the calls of
                                                ducks rang out. The ponds were filled water of eight
                                                qualities. Each tree was draped with nets of jewels
                                                and gold. Between the jeweled trees were jeweled
                                                incense bowls wafting incense, and before each
                                                jeweled tree manifested twenty-five goddesses
                                                bearing sandalwood powder. As soon as Mañjuśrī

                                                Mañjuśrī, to draw an analogy, it is only long after

                                                unable to bear it and will flee. Even a

                                                will become so terrified when it encounters the
                                                scent of the lion cub that it will break its chains
                                                and flee in any direction. Other animals that live
                                                in caves will take shelter in their caves, those
                                                that live in burrows will take shelter in their
                                                burrows, those that live in bodies of water will
                                                take shelter in the water, and birds will fly into

                                                developed the mind directed toward awakening may not

                                                and wisdom, they will outshine all hearers and

                                                mind directed toward awakening. They will scare and
                                                frighten all the māras. They will no longer prefer

                                                Great King, I have not understood suffering. I have

                                                accurately. You declare precisely what you have

                                                mind have you murdered your parents—past, present,
                                                or future? The mind of the past is exhausted and
                                                gone. It has ceased. It has transformed. It does not
                                                exist in any object or in any location. Thus, it
                                                cannot be designated. The mind of the future has not
                                                yet come. It is unborn and unarisen. It has not
                                                occurred; it has not come to exist; it is free of
                                                marks; it has not happened. Therefore, it also

                                                perceived. It is unimpeded, illusory, and
                                                indescribable. Therefore, it cannot be designated.
                                                Listen, sir! The mind is not attached, aggressive,

                                                anything, do anything, feel anything, think
                                                anything, or experience anything. Listen, sir! The
                                                mind is naturally lucid, and it could not become
                                                afflicted or purified. Listen, sir! The mind does
                                                not exist in this life, in another life, or
                                                somewhere other than these two. It is not there or
                                                elsewhere. It is like space. It is unparalleled and
                                                unlike anything, and it cannot be cognized. Those
                                                who are learned will not become attached to it or
                                                take it into possession. They will not indulge in it
                                                or dwell on it. They will not conceive of it as the
                                                self, and they will not think of it as a possession.
                                                Listen, sir! All phenomena are unmoving because they
                                                lack such ability by nature. Listen, sir! With that
                                                understanding, I do not speak of affliction or
                                                purification or of going to the lower realms or the
                                                higher realms. Why is this? The nature of the mind
                                                cannot become afflicted or purified. It does not go,
                                                come, or remain anywhere.”</p>

                                                This Dharma teaching will defeat all non-Buddhists
