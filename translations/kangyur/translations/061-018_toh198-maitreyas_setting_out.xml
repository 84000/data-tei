                    Śākyamuni first narrates events from a past life of the bodhisattva Maitreya in
                    which he was born as a king and for the first time gave rise to the mind set on
                    awakening. Later, the Buddha recounts another past life of Maitreya—this time as
                    a monk—and explains why he is known today as the bodhisattva Maitreya. These two
                    narratives are interspersed with a series of Dharma teachings emphasizing the
                    unborn nature of phenomena and the need to develop the view that transcends all

                        past king, known as Golden Color, who worshiped the Buddha Pure Golden Light
                        for millions of years. At the end of this period, through the skillful
                        teaching of Pure Golden Light, the king gave rise to the mind of awakening,
                        renounced his household, and became a monastic. At this point in the story,
                        the Buddha dramatically reveals that King Golden Color was in fact a
                        previous incarnation of the bodhisattva Maitreya and that all members of the
                        present assembly at Śrāvastī were also present in the retinue at that time.
                        Interestingly, the Buddha mentions here that he himself initially gave rise
                        to the mind set on awakening eighty-four thousand eons after Maitreya did
                            so.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-16"> Note that the
                            explanation of why the Buddha gained awakening faster than Maitreya,
                            although he had originally given rise to the mind set on awakening only
                            after Maitreya had done so, differ from what is recounted in <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya </title>(Toh 85).</note>

                    <p tid="10">Next, the Buddha recounts the story of a monk, Dṛḍhamati, who lived
                        long ago during the time of the Buddha Ratnacchatra. Absorbed within the
                        meditation of loving kindness, the monk Dṛḍhamati could lead beings into
                        that absorption by simply passing by their homes. Amazed by such miraculous
                        displays, all the gods proclaimed in unison that this monk should be called
                        Maitreya (the Loving One). Accordingly, the Buddha Ratnacchatra prophesied
                        that henceforth the monk Dṛḍhamati would be known as the bodhisattva great
                        being Maitreya, even after reaching awakening. The sūtra then comes to a
                        close as everyone rejoices in the words of the Blessed One. </p>

                    <p tid="11">As this sūtra today appears to exist only in Tibetan, we have
                        produced our translation exclusively from the versions contained in the
                        Tibetan Kangyur, basing ourselves on the Degé block print with reference to
                        the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>).
                        The colophon to the Tibetan translation states that it was prepared by Yeshé

                        Surendrabodhi. We can therefore date the Tibetan translation to the late
                        eighth to early ninth centuries, a dating that is also attested by the
                        text’s inclusion in the early ninth-century Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) catalogue.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-19"> The Denkarma catalogue is dated to c. 812

                        will grant you the opportunity so that the matter of your inquiries may be
                        settled: If you do not ask him questions about the vehicle of the buddhas,

                        desire, anger, and ignorance, and if you do not ask him questions about the

                        Maitreya, is that the more one imputes, the more attached one will be, and

                        thinks of them as not being the same, then one is imputing something that
                        does not exist. Thus one might think, ‘This is the Buddha,’ ‘This is the
                        Dharma,’ ‘This is the Saṅgha,’ ‘This is the self,’ ‘This is a sentient
                        being,’ ‘This is a person,’ ‘This is a child of a man,’ ‘This is a human
                        being,’ ‘This is a doer,’ ‘This is an experiencer,’ ‘This is interrupted,’
                        ‘This is permanent,’ ‘This is an ordinary being,’ ‘This is a hearer,’ ‘This
                        is a solitary buddha,’ ‘This is a bodhisattva,’ ‘This is a wrongdoer,’ ‘This
                        is someone free from wrongdoing,’ ‘This is defiled,’ ‘This is undefiled,’
                        ‘This is conditioned,’ ‘This is unconditioned,’ ‘This is thorough
                        affliction,’ ‘This is complete purification,’ ‘This is virtue,’ ‘This is
                        nonvirtue,’ ‘This is mundane,’ ‘This is supramundane,’ ‘This is saṃsāra,’
                        ‘This is nirvāṇa,’ ‘This is an entity,’ ‘This is a nonentity,’ ‘This is
                        existent,’ ‘This is nonexistent,’ ‘This is attainment,’ ‘This is manifest
                        realization,’ ‘This is actualization,’ ‘This is the path,’ or ‘This is the
                        fruition of the path.’ All these are imputations. Why is it so? Because,
                        Venerable Śāriputra, sameness is beyond thought. Those who think in terms of
                        such concepts make imputations upon sameness. They do not make imputations
                        upon a lack of sameness. Those who see sameness without seeing anything are
                        seeing sameness, but those who create imputations perceive things as not
                        sameness. Those who do not reify sameness perceive sameness, but those who
                        impute do not.”</p>

                        Noble son, for example, carving a seal out of space is not easy—there is

                        the attributes of space and the essential nature of space, and that they
                        display space. Phenomena cannot be affixed to space; they are mere
                        imputations. As phenomena of space cannot be affixed and are mere

                        Judging and looking down on others’ discipline, thinking ‘This person’s

                        fire, wind, and space. They must also have acceptance of emptiness.
                        Bodhisattvas do not abandon any sentient being. With a baseless mind that
                        does not set up definite limits, they must be dedicated to the benefit of

                        observe such all-embracing practice, and who can also bear to think that all
                        phenomena are empty, apply and train in the individual gateways of the

                        diligence, pride, and awakening, and I will joyfully wear the armor of
                        diligence beyond reference point.’ A bodhisattva who puts on the armor of
                        diligence in that way applies and trains in the individual gateways of the
                        bodhisattvas.</p>

                        places is appropriate. On the other hand, if, while staying in solitude,
                        they enjoy this isolation, become attached to the experience of
                        concentration, and remain absorbed in that bliss, this is a fault for
                        bodhisattvas. If bodhisattvas do not get tired of practicing generosity, do
                        not rely on conceptual references, develop their qualities while resting
                        inwardly, and are not attached to the experience of concentration but

                        the perfection of insight and understand all phenomena to be empty of
                        intrinsic nature, thinking, ‘Here there is no self, no sentient being, no
                        life force, and no person at all.’ Those bodhisattvas may put effort into
                        taming themselves and into the practice of tranquility, yet if the
                        bodhisattvas do not speak of, point out, or use symbols to communicate this
                        mode of emptiness and selflessness to other sentient beings caught by the
                        mistaken habit of clinging to reference points, then understand that such

                        insight and understand all phenomena to be devoid of and empty of essential
                        nature, thinking, ‘Here there is no self, no sentient being, no life force,
                        and no person at all.’ When those bodhisattvas have a physical experience of
                        all these phenomena that are empty of essential nature, their minds do not
                        fixate on any of them. On the other hand, so that sentient beings who are
                        possessed of errors and adhere to concepts may be freed from their errors
                        and focal points, those bodhisattvas teach them the Dharma—explaining that
                        all phenomena are devoid of essential nature and leading them to the
                        realization that all phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature. You should
                        understand that bodhisattvas are skilled in means and that they apply and
                        train in the individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.</p>

                        bodhisattva who observes loving kindness, who focuses on concentration but
                        remains absorbed in baseless concentration. Great king, there is no other
                        form of bliss that compares to the bliss experienced by a bodhisattva who
                        does not fixate on anything while remaining in absorption and who has
                        developed an attitude of equanimity toward all sentient beings. Great king,
                        the fourth quality is a bodhisattva’s genuine understanding of the Dharma.
                        That bodhisattva understands phenomena as they really are, thinking, <ref cRef="F.289.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-289"/> “All these
                        karmic formations are empty. They are devoid of a self, a sentient being, a
                        life force, someone giving, the act of giving, and someone taking, someone
                        being patient, the situation toward which one is patient, and the object of
                        that patience, someone practicing diligence and the aim of that diligence,
                        someone training in concentration and the object of that training, and
                        someone meditating and the object of that meditation.” When bodhisattvas
                        understand phenomena genuinely in that way, they see that all conditioned
                        phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature. Then, without holding on to any
                        reference points, they remain within the experience of bliss. Great king, a
                        bodhisattva great being who possesses those four Dharma qualities will
                        experience all forms of bliss and swiftly awaken to unsurpassed and perfect
                            buddhahood.’<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-117"> Comparable

                        teachings of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Ratnacchatra. Noble son,
                        at the time of the Thus-Gone One Ratnacchatra’s doctrine, when the monk
                        Dṛḍhamati went begging for alms, there were in this world eighty-four
                        thousand villages, eighty-four thousand cities, eighty-four thousand towns,
                        eighty-four thousand countries, and eighty-four thousand marketplaces. The

                        countries, and marketplaces to beg for alms. During his wanderings, he
                        promised himself, ‘I will not eat any food until I establish a total of one
                        hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts.’ Noble son, with such a

                        fundamental precepts. Noble son, on some occasions it took him one day to
                        establish one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts. On other

                        the third day, when he would then eat again. Sometimes it took him three
                        days to establish one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts. Noble
                        son, sometimes it took him four, five, six, or seven days. Even if he had to

                        wandered in those big towns, villages, cities, towns, countries, and

                        different ways. Divine songs were heard, and a rain of flowers fell from the
                        sky. At that moment, the Four Great Kings, Śakra, lord of the gods, Brahmā,
                        lord of the Sahā world, and many hundreds of thousands of sons of gods
                        strewed the divine mandārava flowers they were carrying in the direction of
                        the bodhisattva great being Maitreya. They said, “Oh! The bodhisattva great
                        being Maitreya has engaged himself for the benefit of many beings. He brings
                        them happiness and has love for the world. He has donned the great armor of
                        diligence to provide tremendous benefit, assistance, and happiness to gods
                        and humans. Even without having reached the level of omniscience, he has
                        accomplished the objectives of myriads of sentient beings. If those who
                        merely hear the name of the bodhisattva great being Maitreya obtain such
                        supreme gains, there is no need to mention the joy of those who see him
                        directly with their own eyes. Venerable One, Blessed One, <ref cRef="F.295.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-301"/> we pay homage

                        in unison, “We pay homage to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya! We pay

                        prophecy: “The roots of virtue of many thousands of beings have been brought
                        to maturity, and they will actualize the level of worthy ones within the

                                    gone,” or as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathā-agata</foreign>,

                                    in conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is
                                    interpreted in different ways, but in general it implies one who
                                    has departed in the wake of the buddhas of the past, or one who
                                    has manifested the supreme enlightenment dependent on the
                                    reality that does not abide in the two extremes of existence and
