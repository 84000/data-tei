                                        in the lower realms. Realizing that the Tathāgata is the

                                                opens in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, where the

                                                interrupted by a voice warning him that he will die
                                                within a week, experience seven rebirths in
                                                Jambudvīpa, and then be born as a hell being.
                                                Supratiṣṭhita rushes in panic to Śakra, Lord of the
                                                Gods, seeking his help. Śakra, shocked by this news,
                                                sees that Supratiṣṭhita will be born in the lower

                                                rays emerge from the Buddha’s uṣṇīṣa, illuminating

                                                mouth. The Buddha then explains the qualities of the

                                                vows to protect all beings. The Four Great Kings
                                                then ask the Buddha to explain the rite related to

                                                liberated from the lower realms as well as from all

                                                  the manuscript lacks several passages that are
                                                  found in the Tibetan translation of Toh 597 and
                                                  contains a few passages that are absent in that
                                                  translation, including two passages that are found
                                                  in Toh 594. Nonetheless, the Sanskrit manuscript
                                                  is by and large the same work that is translated

                                                exactly, Uṣṇīṣavijayā is is a complex one that
                                                cannot be clearly answered here. In short, like a
                                                number of uṣṇīṣa deities, she is sometimes
                                                identified as a protective deity, in this case a
                                                goddess, emanated from the Buddha’s uṣṇīṣa. Indeed,
                                                in the later Tibetan tradition Uṣṇīṣavijayā is
                                                clearly depicted as a goddess and can even appear as
                                                one of a group of three long-life deities along with
                                                the Buddha Amitāyus and White Tārā. However, in all

                                                dhāraṇī to the god Supratiṣṭhita. That god

                                                were fulfilled. He was liberated from the lower

                                                proclaimed the following meaningful statement: “How
