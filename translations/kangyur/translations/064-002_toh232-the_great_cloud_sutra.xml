            Discourse</title> features a long dialogue between the Buddha Śākyamuni and a
          bodhisattva named Great Cloud Essence, who are periodically joined by various additional
          interlocutors from the vast audience of human and divine beings who have assembled to hear
          the Buddha’s teaching. The topics of their conversation are diverse and wide ranging, but
          a central theme is the vast conduct of bodhisattvas, which is illustrated through the
          enumeration of the various meditative states and liberative techniques that bodhisattvas
          must master in order to minister to all sentient beings. This is followed by a
          conversation with a brahmin named Kauṇḍinya concerning the Buddha’s cousin Devadatta, who
          is revealed to be a bodhisattva displaying the highest level of skillful means. Kauṇḍinya
          then inquires about the possibility of obtaining a relic from the Buddha, and another
          member of the audience responds with an explanation of how truly rare it is for a buddha
          relic to appear within the world. Finally, the discourse ends with the Buddha delivering a
          series of detailed prophecies describing the principal interlocutor’s future attainment of
          Buddhahood, and he further explains the benefits and powers that can be obtained through
          the practice of this discourse itself.</tei:p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Great
              Cloud Discourse</title> is an important source of ideas relating to docetic
            Buddhology, the doctrine that living buddhas are not flesh-and-blood human beings but
            rather phantasms magically created to guide and serve as examples to sentient beings.
            One of the main themes of the discourse is the idea that the Tathāgata is permanent and
            does not really pass into parinirvāṇa but strategically displays an illusory body that
            seems to strive for awakening and eventually pass into parinirvāṇa to exemplify
            religious attainment. This docetic view is supported by the quite astonishing claim that
            early Buddhist doctrines of impermanence and selflessness were merely provisional
            teachings imparted by the Buddha for the sake of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who were
            too trepidatious and spiritually immature to accept the realities of permanence and true
            selfhood. These antinomian themes are shared with the famous <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāparinirvāṇa-mahāsūtra</title>, which exerted a tremendous influence on doctrinal
            developments in Chinese and East Asian Buddhism in the fifth and sixth centuries.
            Indeed, Chinese bibliographers classified <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud
              Discourse</title> with a handful of other discourses that they considered to be
            related to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāparinirvāṇa-mahāsūtra</title>, arguably the
            earliest extant work on buddha nature (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgata­garbha</foreign>).<tei:note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-002-7"> See
              Radich 2015, 19ff.</tei:note>
            <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud Discourse</title> is also thematically related to
              <title xml:lang="en">The Golden Light Discourse</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Suvarṇa­prabhāsottama­sūtra</title>, <ref rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh556.html">Toh 556</ref>/<ref rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh557.html">Toh 557</ref>),
            and a dialogue that occurs in chapter thirty-seven between the brahmin Kauṇḍinya and a
            Licchavi youth is also found in the various Tibetan and Chinese recensions of that
              discourse.<tei:note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-002-8"> Suzuki (1996) has
              suggested that <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud Discourse</title> may in fact be

            <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud Discourse</title> opens with a long introduction
            that enumerates the various assemblies of human and nonhuman beings who were in
            attendance when the discourse was spoken. This section, which takes up the entirety of
            the first fascicle and continues into the second fascicle, is one of the longest and
            most detailed introductions to be found in any Mahāyāna discourse.</tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="11">The scripture goes on to introduce
            the primary interlocutor, a bodhisattva named Great Cloud Essence, who emerges from the
            assembly to ask the Buddha a long series of questions on a variety of topics related to
            the conduct of bodhisattvas. The Buddha praises the bodhisattva’s questions and responds
            by introducing <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud Discourse</title>, which is
            described as the “steadfast treasury of the sacred Dharma.” Great Cloud Essence asks for
            more teachings on this topic, and the Buddha grants his request, which prompts a great
            display of miraculous signs, eliciting praise for the Buddha’s qualities from the entire
            the assembly.</tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="12">In the second chapter, the Buddha
            explains that <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud Discourse</title> contains four
            hundred “samādhi gateways” that all bodhisattvas should master. He gives an extensive
            explanation of the first samādhi and its qualities. These qualities correspond to the
            questions asked by Great Cloud Essence in the first chapter. The Buddha proceeds to
            enumerate the remaining samādhis and repeats all the qualities enumerated for the first
            samādhi, explaining that they apply likewise to all the other samādhi gateways.</tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="13">These two long chapters are
            followed by a series of short sections. Chapters three through thirty-six each follow
            the same general structure: Great Cloud Essence asks the Bhagavān to enumerate a series
            of techniques or “gateways”—dhāraṇī gateways, liberation gateways, Dharma gateways,
            etc.—related to a single theme. The Buddha then lists those gateways, and a member of
            the audience steps forth, makes offerings, and offers a short praise of the Buddha’s
            teachings.</tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="14">In the penultimate chapter,
            chapter thirty-seven, Great Cloud Essence asks again about the four hundred samādhi
            gateways, and the Buddha responds with a long discussion of the various practices to be
            performed by bodhisattvas who cultivate the teachings of <title xml:lang="en">The Great
              Cloud Discourse</title>. An important theme of this section is that bodhisattvas must

            using skillful means to give the appearance of engaging in all manner of activities that
            might be considered contrary to the Dharma, such as having a family, accumulating

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="15">Following this discussion, we are
            introduced to another interlocutor, the brahmin Kauṇḍinya, who steps forth to question
            the Buddha specifically about the Buddha’s cousin Devadatta. Kauṇḍinya condemns the
            conduct of Devadatta and the so-called “group of six monks,” who are always finding ways
            to break the rules of pure conduct set forth by the Buddha. However, Great Cloud
            Essence, speaking on behalf of the Buddha, chides Kauṇḍinya for his views and explains
            that Devadatta and the group of six are really bodhisattvas displaying skillful means.
            Following this, Kauṇḍinya requests the Buddha to grant him the boon of a relic that he
            can venerate. A Licchavi youth steps forward from the audience and explains to Kauṇḍinya
            just how rare it is for a buddha relic to appear in the world. Then, a goddess named
              <term ref="UT22084-064-002-1128">Stainless Light</term> steps forth and asks the
            Buddha about the brahmin and the Licchavi. The Buddha proceeds to explain that these two
            beings have been karmically connected for many eons, describe their former activities,
            and give a prophecy of their future attainment of buddhahood. The Buddha then gives
            further prophecies for these two individuals and for the goddess <term ref="UT22084-064-002-1128">Stainless Light</term> and the bodhisattva Great Cloud
            Essence. Most notably, Kauṇḍinya is to be reborn as the Mauryan king Aśoka.</tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="16">The final chapter, chapter
            thirty-eight, continues this theme of prophecies, as a host of gods questions the Buddha
            about the future fate of this discourse. The Buddha explains that in the future there
            will be many people who will question the authenticity and legitimacy of this discourse
            and its teachings. However, there will arise one monk who will defend the sūtra and
            spread its teachings, and due to his dedication, the teachings will not disappear. The
            Buddha goes on to describe the merits that will come from practicing the teachings of
            this discourse. He displays a series of great miracles and, when questioned by Great
            Cloud Essence, describes all the altruistic magical acts that bodhisattvas who cultivate
            these teachings will display to engage with ordinary beings in accordance with their
            individual dispositions and guide them to take up the Buddhist teachings. Finally, the
            Buddha gives a prophecy for the goddess <term ref="UT22084-064-002-1128">Stainless
              Light</term>, explaining that she will be born as a princess who will rule her kingdom
            as a queen who will carry out many awakened activities before being reborn in the pure
            land of the buddha Amitābha, where she will finally attain buddhahood.</tei:p>

            thereby have their tongues cut out. You should direct those who have used wisdom to
            comprehend the concealed intent of the Tathāgata, followed the Tathāgata in going forth

            endowed with virtuous qualities, and fit to be empowered as a great king. He does not
            give rise to the thought that he would prefer to belong to a lower level of society. He
            knows that his status is that of a ruler of a great kingdom. Similarly, those who do not

            are endowed with all the virtuous qualities of Dharma and fit to be empowered as great

            they would prefer others that are of a lower status than this supreme samādhi—it would
            be baseless to say so. They are suited for the status of this vast samādhi.</tei:p>

            that the Buddhadharma will abide for an exceptionally long time. Bodhisattvas who abide
