        <p tid="2">While the Buddha Śākyamuni is residing at Vulture Peak Mountain, in the nearby city of Rājagṛha the accomplished illusionist Bhadra
          hatches a scheme to humiliate the Buddha and disprove his omniscience in order to win over the people of Magadha. The failure of Bhadra’s
          plan, in which he conjures the illusion of a resplendent courtyard that, to his dismay, cannot be undone, culminates in a series of surreal
          and magnificent visions that convince Bhadra of the superiority of the Buddha’s powers. This sūtra presents a colorful and often humorous
          narrative and contains teachings on illusion, emptiness, and the distinction between the illusionist’s mundane abilities and the Buddha’s
          miraculous display. The Buddha also teaches Bhadra forty-three sets of four qualities that together constitute the bodhisattva path.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Prophecy for Bhadra the Illusionist</title> contains a colorful and often humorous narrative. Shades of
            this narrative, in which a non-Buddhist attempts to humiliate the Buddha Śākyamuni and <term rend="ignore">wind</term>s up the fool, are
            also found in the Pali Buddhist tradition, and the appeal of this particular story as Buddhism spread through Central Asia is apparent in
            its loose retelling in Khotanese literature. Its central theme is the Buddha’s miraculous powers, here compared to the lesser powers of an
            illusionist named Bhadra. The sūtra is an emblematic example of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">adbhutadharma</foreign>, or
            “account of miraculous events,” one of the nine or twelve classic categories of the Pali and Sanskrit sūtras.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-002-59"> There are many examples of this genre in the Tibetan canon, perhaps the most famous being the stories of
              the “twin miracle” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yama­kaprātihārya</foreign>) and the “great miracle” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mahāprātihārya</foreign>), both of which are represented in the Tibetan Kangyur within the compiled text
              of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayakṣudra­kavastu</title> (Toh 6).<ref rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh6.html"/> We would also direct readers interested in this subject to <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching on the Extraordinary Transformation That Is the Miracle of Attaining the Buddha’s Powers</title> (Toh 186), particularly
              the introduction to the English translation, which discusses the topic of the supernatural powers and, at <ptr target="#UT22084-061-006-12"/>, provides a list of sūtras in which miraculous
              display (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">cho ’phrul</foreign>) play an important role. See Buddhavacana Translation Group
              2016b.</note> The latter portion of the text, in which the Buddha prophesies Bhadra’s future awakening, exemplifies the genre of
              <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign>, or “prophecy,” as expressed in the sūtra’s title.</p>

          <p tid="11">The sūtra opens at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha, where the Buddha is residing with his saṅgha of monks and bodhisattvas.
            Down in the city, the accomplished illusionist Bhadra hatches a plan to test and humiliate the Buddha in order to win over the people of
            Magadha. Bhadra approaches the Buddha and offers to host him for the midday meal the following day. His plan is to expose the Buddha,
            since if the Buddha does not know his malicious intentions, it will prove the Buddha’s lack of omniscience. Over the course of the night,
            Bhadra conjures up the illusion of a resplendent courtyard filled with food and drink and servants. Just then, the Four Great Kings appear
            and ask for permission to create a second courtyard in which to offer a meal to the Buddha, and then Śakra and his host of gods ask if
            they may create a third. Bhadra grants them permission but begins to grow apprehensive. Then, when he tries to unravel his illusory
            display, he cannot. Śakra explains that since even a tiny offering to a buddha will inevitably lead to nirvāṇa, Bhadra’s offering cannot
            be withdrawn.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-002-61"/>
          <p tid="12">In the morning, the Buddha and his retinue proceed as planned to the reception in the city, whereupon Bhadra, seeing how the
            Buddha is revered by the gods, feels remorse for his initial devious intentions. Through the Buddha’s power, Bhadra, Śakra, and the Four
            Great Kings each simultaneously perceive the Buddha seated at their own conjured courtyards. Bhadra, defeated, bows to the Buddha and
            confesses his intentions, and the assembly partakes of the illusory feast. </p>

            visually appear before the eyes of its spectators, who are thus deceived into taking these conjurations as real and solid things. In
            truth, however, these appearances, like a hologram or a projection of light, have no tangible substance. While the illusions of an
            illusionist are considered real magic, that is to say, they are created from supernatural abilities acquired through meditative
            concentration or other spiritual disciplines, such magical abilities are considered a sort of mundane, worldly magic, particularly in

          <p tid="19">Such magical illusion is often referred to in early Buddhist sources as a metaphor for the illusory or insubstantial and

            appear to be solid and real but under close scrutiny and examination are impermanent, dependent, and transient. From the perspective of
            the Mahāyāna, they lack an inherent <term rend="ignore">nature </term>(Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niḥsvabhāva</foreign>,
            Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rang bzhin med pa</foreign>). Like magical illusions, phenomena lack any substantiality beyond
            the spectacle. Within the Mahāyāna, “illusion” was regularly included in conventional lists of eight or ten similes for how phenomena lack
            an inherent <term rend="ignore">nature</term>.</p>

              the Illusionist</title> is unique in that the illusionist is the central figure and interlocutor of the entire sūtra. The story is set
            up to accomplish two things regarding the theme of magical illusion: one, it establishes the superiority of the Buddha’s miraculous power
            over the limited and mundane magic of Bhadra the illusionist, and two, it retains and elaborates upon the metaphorical understanding
            whereby all phenomena are considered to be magical illusions. </p>

          <p tid="21">In this sūtra, as elsewhere, the term <distinct>illusion</distinct> carries a pejorative connotation. Even though Bhadra is said
            to have great powers, his power of illusion is only ever referred to using the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">māyā</foreign>
            (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sgyu ma</foreign>) or the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nirmita</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nirmāna</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sprul
              pa</foreign>, “conjuration”), while the Buddha’s supernatural power is usually referred to as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">cho ’phrul</foreign>, “miraculous display”). However, at one point in
            the sūtra, when Maudgalyāyana attempts to warn him of Bhadra’s trickery, the Buddha responds by comparing his own power to that of Bhadra,
            using the same word, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">māyā</foreign>, for both, yet he explains that while Bhadra’s power of
            illusion is “limited” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyogs gcig pa</foreign>), his own is “pure” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">yang dag pa</foreign>). Since the Buddha has fully and completely realized the insubstantial <term rend="ignore">nature
            </term>of <emph>all</emph> phenomena and the truth that phenomena are primordially unborn, his power to create illusions, which are in
            this way no different from ordinary perceived reality, is unlimited. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-002-72"/>
          <p tid="22">At the climax of the story, the inspired and newly converted Bhadra gives a short discourse on the ultimate <term rend="ignore">nature </term>of phenomena using the convoluted language that has characterized his speech at various points throughout the text. When
            Ānanda teases Bhadra for the bewildering language with which he expresses the Dharma, he audaciously turns the accusation back onto the
            Buddha himself, referring to the Buddha as the “great bewilderer.” He justifies this by pointing out that while teaching selflessness, the
            Buddha speaks using terms like “sentient beings,” and while denying the birth and death of all phenomena, he nevertheless often refers to
            birth and death. This is an important summation of the narrative, which once again returns to its theme of juxtaposing Bhadra’s mundane
            powers of illusion with the miraculous displays of the Buddha. In some ways, the Buddha’s powers bewilder his followers, too, such as when
            he creates emanations of himself earlier in the narrative to simultaneously receive offerings from Bhadra, Śakra, and the Four Great
            Kings. From the ultimate view, the Buddha’s teachings may appear deceptive, because he teaches using conventional terminology for
            phenomena. This, however, is a form of skillful means, since he knows that all phenomena ultimately lack inherent <term rend="ignore">nature</term>. </p>

          <p tid="23">So, although Bhadra’s initial use of powers of illusion to deceive, trick, and swindle people is presented here with a
            conventional negative connotation, the power to deceive through illusion is not necessarily considered in a negative light in this
            discourse. Rather, illusion serves as an instructive symbol that illustrates the relative and insubstantial <term rend="ignore">nature
            </term>of phenomena. The Buddha’s miraculous displays, while being at one level no different from the illusionist’s conjurations, do not
            have the same negative connotations, because they are always done with an intention to inspire and teach. In this way, conjuring illusions
            is an example of skillful means. Such illusions illustrate the true <term rend="ignore">nature </term>of reality; their source is not
            mundane sorcery but a quality of awakening, demonstrating the realization of suchness as the true <term rend="ignore">nature </term>of
            reality. </p>

              power of instruction rather than the miraculous power of magical display, as in the Tibetan and Chinese, because he is too intelligent
              for the latter.

            mats that Garahadinna expects the Buddha to sit on. When the Buddha sits down, however, the mats and coals become lotus flowers on which

                  mean “notion,” “sign,” “conception,” or “clear understanding.” It is also used more specifically in Buddhist scholastic contexts for
                  “the aggregate of perceptions” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saṃjñāskandha</foreign>). In this presentation, as the third
                  of the five aggregates, it refers to the mental function of differentiating and identifying objects according to their qualities.
                  Thus it does not refer to the perceptions of the senses but to the conceptual notions or labels that are ascribed to sense
                  perceptions before they may be conceived by the rational mind. In this sense, they are not really concepts or thoughts either, but
                  rather the fundamental units ascribed to phenomena by the dualistic mind in order to form conceptual thoughts about them.</p>

                                <p>A miraculous or wondrous power attributed to buddhas or, occasionally, other spiritually advanced beings.
                  Generally these are miraculous displays for the purpose of benefiting beings or impressing them in such a way as to inspire faith
                  and devotion. In this way, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign> is distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ṛddhi</foreign> (translated here as “magical power”), which is a more general term for magical or
                  psychic powers typically obtained through meditative concentration (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhyāna</foreign>).
                    (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Ṛddhi</foreign> is also a subtype of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātihārya</foreign>.) Although in many cases the Buddha dissuades monks from using miraculous powers to impress disciples or lay
                  followers, he nonetheless exhibits them himself in many narratives. The two most well known of such events from the Buddha’s life
                  were said to occur at Śrāvastī:<ref rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh6.html"/> the “twin miracle”
                    (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">yama­kaprātihārya</foreign>) where he simultaneously emanated fire and water from his
                  body, and the “great miracle” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mahāprātihārya</foreign>) in which the Buddha, while seated on
                  a lotus, emanated multiple forms of himself in the sky—quite similar to his emanation of multiple Buddhas found in <title xml:lang="en">The Prophecy for Bhadra the Illusionist</title> (<ptr target="#UT22084-043-002-202"/>). A buddha’s miraculous powers
                  for the purpose of benefitting beings are classified in three categories: (1) the miraculous power of magical display, (2) the
                  miraculous power of foretelling, and (3) the miraculous power of instruction. These three are respectively associated with and
                  considered to be aspects of the buddha’s body, speech, and mind. This term is translated elsewhere as “miraculous
                display.”</p>

                  his ability in magical powers (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ṛddhi</foreign>), and there are many accounts describing his
                  magical displays such as flying and creating multiple forms of himself. Maudgalyāyana is an interlocutor in many Mahāyāna sūtras.

                  Anāthapiṇḍada. According to the Pali tradition, Subhūti is considered foremost among the Buddha’s disciples for dwelling peacefully
                  in isolated places (Pali: <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">dakkhiṇeyyānaṃ</foreign>) and being a worthy recipient of gifts
                  (Pali: <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">araṇa­vihārīnaṃ aggo</foreign>). He is said to have become an arhat through meditative

                  household he visited, and thereby he bestowed the conditions for the highest possible merit for his donors. In the Mahāyāna
                  tradition, he is particularly known to be one of the primary interlocutors in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and is sometimes referred to
                  as the foremost among the Buddha’s disciples for understanding emptiness, although as we see by his verse given in <title xml:lang="en">The Prophecy for Bhadra the Illusionist</title> he still retains his association with gift giving and generosity.
