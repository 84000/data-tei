                    <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of the Nāga King Anavatapta</title> is
                    a discourse that provides guidance on core features of the bodhisattva path,
                    including the perfections, mindfulness, and meditation, with a strong
                    orientation toward emptiness as the inexpressible ultimate nature. As the Buddha
                    is teaching at Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha, a nāga king named Anavatapta
                    approaches, questions him on these topics, and receives instruction on them. 
                    He then invites the Buddha to his home at <term>Anavatapta</term>, the legendary
                    lake from which the four rivers of Jambudvīpa flow. After flying there with an
                    enormous entourage, the Buddha resumes his teachings. The assembly is joined by
                    Mañjuśrī and thousands of other bodhisattvas, and there ensues a debate on the
                    relative merits of the hearer path and the bodhisattva path. At the culmination
                    of the sūtra, the Buddha prophesies Anavatapta’s future awakening, and the nāga
                    king and his entire family take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the
                    Saṅgha.</p>

                            Anavatapta</title> is a Mahāyāna discourse that provides guidance on
                        core features of the bodhisattva path, including the perfections,
                        mindfulness, and meditation. As the sūtra opens, the Buddha is teaching at
                        Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha. A nāga king named Anavatapta
                        approaches, accompanied by myriad nāgas bearing lavish gifts, and presents a
                        wide-ranging set of questions on how one should follow the bodhisattva path.
                        Rather than respond to each question individually, the Buddha replies that
                        if bodhisattvas simply have one quality, they have them all: this single
                        quality is “the mind of omniscience that does not overlook any being.”
                        As the Buddha elaborates, it becomes clear that the term <distinct>mind of
                            omniscience</distinct>
                        is used in this discourse synonymously with the more common <distinct>mind of awakening</distinct> (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bodhicitta</foreign>), the bodhisattva’s
                        intent to achieve awakening and its attendant omniscience, not only for
                        themselves but for all beings.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-005-1063">The terms 
                            “omniscience” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sarvajñātā</foreign>, 
                            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">thams cad mkhyen pa</foreign>) and “all-aspect

                        and thus the term “mind of omniscience” is more widespread in that literature

                        enumerate the many qualities of bodhisattvas who develop the mind of
                        omniscience, his explanation culminating in an analogy of “the tree of the
                        mind of omniscience,” the seeds, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers,
                        and fruits of which symbolize the various motivations, virtues, practices,
                        and attainments that together constitute the bodhisattva path and its
                        results.</p>

                    <p tid="10">Delighted with the Buddha’s answer, the nāga king Anavatapta seeks
                        further clarification about “the pure path of bodhisattvas.” In response,
                        the Buddha states that although the pure path of bodhisattvas may be pursued
                        through eight frameworks starting with the path of the perfections, all
                        eight paths are one in the perspective of ultimate truth. The emphasis then
                        turns to the theme of purity (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rnam par dag pa</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pariviśuddha</foreign>), which is presented here as
                        synonymous with emptiness and the true nature (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chos nyid</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmatā</foreign>), in which “the purity
                        of space, the purity of all phenomena, and the purity of the self are
                        inseparable” and “cannot be divided.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-005-66"> Folios 215.a–215.b, <ptr target="#UT22084-058-005-167"/>. That is to say, they are “nondual”

                        may be cultivated through meditation. The Buddha replies that the path is cultivated when
                        the body, speech, and mind are pure. In this context, the pure body refers
                        to the realization that the body, like everything material, is ultimately of
                        the same illusory nature as all phenomena. Pure speech is the realization
                        that all speech is insubstantial, like an echo, and that words and terms are
                        merely conventional designations. Pure mind means recognizing the true
                        nature of the mind as unafflicted and luminous.</p>

                    <p tid="13">After some further teachings on cultivating the path through
                        nonconceptual meditation, the nāga king invites the Buddha to visit his home
                        at <term>Lake Anavatapta</term>, the legendary lake close to Mount Meru
                        considered to be the source of the four great rivers of Jambudvīpa. When the
                        Buddha signals his <term rend="ignore">acceptance</term> of the invitation,
                        the nāga king returns home and busily prepares the land between <term>Lake

                        area between Lake Manasarovar and Mount Kailash) to receive the Buddha,
                        miraculously adorning the entire area with trees and palaces. Once all
                        preparations have been made, Anavatapta again intones his invitation and is
                        heard from afar by the Buddha, who then departs from Vulture Peak Mountain
                        along with an enormous entourage of bodhisattvas and a smaller company of
                        hearers. Soaring together through the sky, they attract many gods and other
                        beings, who follow in their wake.</p>

                        the Buddha instructs Maudgalyāyana to travel ahead and ask the nāga king
                        Anavatapta whether it is time for the Thus-Gone One to arrive. Maudgalyāyana
                        rises into the sky and, taking on the form of a garuḍa, surveys <term>Lake

                        king calms them, recognizing the garuḍa as the magical emanation of
                        Maudgalyāyana, and the nāgas welcome the Buddha and his entourage into their
                        magically-transformed realm. </p>

                        the quality of “heedfulness that holds fast to the profound Dharma.” In
                        elaborating on this, he explains “heedfulness” as the quality that
                        characterizes those who properly understand dependent origination. For it is
                        only through the genuine understanding of dependent origination that one
                        obtains insight into the true nature. Those who have this knowledge and keep it, he explains,
                        are the “heedful.”</p>

                    <p tid="16">There then follows a discourse with five hundred nāga princes, who
                        ask further questions about how a bodhisattva should practice, relating in
                        particular to faith, to how the turn the wheel of Dharma, and how to
                        maintain the sacred Dharma. One of the nāga princes is <term rend="ignore">inspired to speak</term>,
                        presenting his own summary of what the Buddha has taught, after which he is
                        questioned by various members of the Buddha’s entourage. An interesting
                        feature of the ensuing discussion is an apparent disagreement that emerges
                        when the nāga princes express an intention to create a shrine after the
                        Buddha’s death, at which his body could be venerated “undivided and whole.”
                        This is challenged by Mahākāśyapa, who says that this would deprive most
                        beings of the opportunity to develop virtuous qualities, and that greater
                        benefit would be achieved by dividing his body into many relics, a point to
                        which the nāgas accede. Following this debate, a lotus blooms in the middle
                        of <term>Lake Anavatapta</term>, and the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, along with
                        thousands of other bodhisattvas, arrives from the distant buddha field of
                        Ratnavyūhā.</p>

                    <p tid="17">Mahākāśyapa and Mañjuśrī then discuss the
                        relative merits of the hearer and bodhisattva paths. A number of nāga
                        princes and other figures, such as Subhūti, join the debate, which concludes
                        with King Anavatapta, along with his entire retinue of wives and relatives,
                        taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. When the nāga king
                        recites an aspiration prayer that all beings may achieve complete awakening,
                        the Buddha gives one of his radiant smiles, and he proceeds to give a
                        prophecy concerning the nāga king’s future lives and his eventual complete
                        and perfect awakening. At the end of the sūtra, King Anavatapta escorts the
                        Buddha and his entourage back to Vulture Peak Mountain, where he repeats the

                        subject to sudden affliction, and by proximity to affliction it becomes
                        further afflicted. Bodhisattvas give no opportunity for those temporary
                        afflictions to arise. They understand that naturally pure mental acts that

                        roots of virtue are mind’s very nature. They understand that mental acts
                        that radiate love to all beings are the same as the mind. They understand
                        that mental acts that dedicate all roots of virtue toward awakening are the
                        same as awakening. In this way, although those of pure mind may coexist with
                        those who engage in lustful behavior, they are not in any way polluted by
                        the stains of desire. Likewise, though they may coexist with those who
                        behave with aversion, delusion, or all afflictions in equal measure, they
                        are not polluted by those stains. In the same way, even when those with pure
                        minds are born in the desire realm, <ref cRef="F.217.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-005-886"/> they cannot be outshone by the peaceful
                        brahmās of the form realm. Rather, it is the bodhisattvas who outshine the

                        and coexist with beings of the desire realm, they do not become
                        disheartened. Nor do they despise those beings who assert a self. In the
                        same way, if those with a pure mind rest evenly in all the absorptions and
                        attainments, they will not be reborn through the power of those

                        constant mindfulness, alertness, and heedfulness. Why? Because the Blessed

                        entourage; and he is disciplined, and so are those in his entourage.
                        Therefore, for half a month you must not enter your wives’ quarters; you
                        must neither have nor entertain lustful thoughts; you must neither have nor

                    <p tid="222">“What is the developed power of memory? It is the memory that can
                        recall and retain the words of any buddha. The developed power of
                        intelligence is the intelligence of a bodhisattva that has been bestowed by
                        a buddha and that cannot be shaken by any being. The developed power of
                        realization means understanding all the meanings of an oral teaching. The
                        developed power of modesty means being endowed with all virtuous qualities,
                        having rejected all nonvirtuous qualities. The developed power of conviction
                        means maintaining exalted behavior even in the face of hardship. The
                        developed power of merit means being unassailable by the billionfold hordes
                        of Māra. The developed power of retention means the ability to remember all
                        the words of the Buddha upon hearing them, to not forget them, and to teach
                        them to others. The developed power of eloquence is the ability to explain
                        the teachings of definitive meaning for a hundred thousand eons without any
                        obstacles, interruptions, or impediments. <ref cRef="F.230.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-005-911"/> The developed power of form eclipses
                        beings like Śakra and <term>Brahmā</term> when they approach such
                        bodhisattvas. The developed power of wealth means having an inexhaustible
                        wealth of jewels and riches at one’s disposal. The developed power of the
                        body means being impervious to harm from any opponent. The developed power
                        of the mind means knowing the mental activity of all beings. The developed
                        power of magical transformation means teaching the Dharma to beings who are
                        to be tamed by means of miraculous powers by displaying all kinds of magical
                        transformations and miraculous displays. The developed power of teaching the
                        Dharma means giving different kinds of teachings so as to bring an end to
                        suffering for those who understand the Dharma teachings of the bodhisattvas,
                        thereby allowing them to reach emancipation. The developed power of
                        subjugating Māra is an unequaled power because it does not reject any action
                        undertaken for the sake of the qualities of the Buddha. The developed power
                        of perseverance means following through on one’s words. Those are the
                        sixteen developed powers that are attained.</p>

                    <p tid="331">“Friends, I will now speak a little about how the Thus-Gone One has
                        turned the wheel of Dharma. The Thus-Gone One has not turned the wheel of
                        Dharma in order to teach what is and what is not the Dharma. He has not
                        turned the wheel of Dharma in order to deconstruct what is the Dharma and
                        what is not the Dharma. The Thus-Gone One has not turned the wheel of Dharma
                        in order to teach that the dharma of ordinary beings is inferior and that
                        the Dharma of the noble ones is vast. Friends, the Thus-Gone One has turned
                        the wheel of Dharma in order to show that both the dharma of ordinary beings
                        and the Dharma of the noble ones are by nature unborn. Since this wheel of
                        Dharma has been turned thoroughly and completely and without interruption,
                        it is the wheel that turns unceasingly. Since the wheel of Dharma is turned
                        in accordance with the law of dependent origination, it is the wheel of the
                        unborn. Since it is not turned with duality—it is not turned to teach about
                        the sensory perceptions, from the eye and forms up to the mind and mental
                        phenomena—it is the wheel of nonduality. Since the wheel is not turned while
                        focusing on past, present, or future phenomena, it is the wheel of the
                        absence of reference points. Since the wheel is turned without adhering to
                        the view of a self, a being, a life force, a soul, or a person, it is the
                        wheel of emptiness. Since the wheel is not turned while fixating on signs or
                        entertaining mental constructs, it is the wheel of signlessness. Since the
                        wheel is not turned for the sake of the attainments of the desire realm, the
                        form realm, or the formless realm, <ref cRef="F.238.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-005-928"/> it is the wheel of wishlessness. The

                        who are training,’ ‘These teachings are for those who are no longer
                        training,’ and ‘These teachings are for the buddhas,’ it is the wheel of the
                        absence of differentiation. Since this wheel does not engage with
                        conventional designations of phenomena, it is the wheel of nonabiding.</p>

                        is the wheel of thusness. Since it severs the flow of mental activity, it is
                        the wheel of the absence of formation. Since it leads to the attainment of

                        everything inside, it is the wheel of emptiness. Since it does not engage
                        with anything outside, it is the wheel of signlessness. Since it is
                        untainted by both the external and the internal, it is the wheel of
                        wishlessness. Since it is beyond expression, it is the wheel of the

                        Lord of nāgas, the entrance into the flawlessness of hearers is not

                        fruition. The entrance into the flawlessness of bodhisattvas is
                        transcendent. Rather than leading to the hearers’ attainment of fruition, it
                        brings one closer to ultimate fruition—the seat of awakening. Therefore, the
                        flawlessness of hearers is limited, while the flawlessness of bodhisattvas
                        is unlimited.</p>

                        prepared, and clever. After he has fallen there, he manages to pull himself

                        who is weaker and unskilled, remains stuck at the bottom. Similarly, lord of

                        that all phenomena are empty, signless, wishless, and unfabricated, and
                        having perfected skillful means through their great compassion toward all

                        vehicle of the hearers achieve their result by means of the intellectual

                        represents uncompounded phenomena, the diligent person represents a

                                    five or six. The first five are divine sight, divine hearing,
                                    knowing how to manifest miracles, remembering previous lives,
                                    and knowing the minds of others. A sixth, knowing that all
                                    defilements have been eliminated, is often added. The first five
                                    are attained through concentration (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhyāna</foreign>), and are

                                    extent by non-Buddhist yogis, while the sixth is supramundane
                                    and attained only by realization‍—by bodhisattvas, or according
                                    to some accounts, only by buddhas.</p>

                                <p>The principle of dependent origination
                                    asserts that nothing exists independently of other factors, the
                                    reason for this being that things and events come into existence
                                    only in dependence on the aggregation of causes and conditions.
                                    In general, the processes of cyclic existence, through which the
                                    external world and the beings within it revolve in a continuous
                                    cycle of suffering, propelled by the propensities of past
                                    actions and their interaction with afflicted mental states,
                                    originate depending on the sequential unfolding of twelve links,
                                    commencing from ignorance and ending with birth, aging, and
                                    death. It is only through deliberate reversal of these twelve
                                    links that one can succeed in bringing the cycle to an
                                end.</p>
