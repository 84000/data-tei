                                        Śākyamuni to explain the conduct of bodhisattvas. The Buddha
                                        responds by describing how bodhisattvas train in many
                                        practices and in the cultivation of many qualities, here
                                        presented in sets of four, related to generosity and

                                                bodhisattvas. The sūtra presents a dialogue between
                                                Śāriputra and the Buddha Śākyamuni at Vulture Peak

                                                of Magadha (present-day Bihar). Śāriputra opens the
                                                conversation by asking the Buddha, “What are the
                                                deeds related to the aspects of the bodhisattvas’
                                                truth?” The Buddha responds by expounding on a wide
                                                variety of qualities that bodhisattvas cultivate on
                                                their journey to awakening. These include, but are
                                                not limited to, expositions on the importance of
                                                generosity and diligence. The qualities are
                                                generally presented in groups of four and relate to
                                                vastly different themes.</p>

                                        <p tid="11">One of the sets of four, for example, is
                                                patience, unimpeded wisdom and vision, undivided
                                                wisdom and vision, and unattached wisdom and vision,
                                                for which the Buddha says that bodhisattvas will be
                                                praised. In another set of four, the Buddha teaches
                                                that bodhisattvas will remember their past lives
                                                once they have perfected their training so that
                                                their acts are in accord with their words, their
                                                words are in accord with their acts, they have
                                                abandoned aggression, and they rely on wisdom. The
                                                Buddha also teaches that bodhisattvas will remember
                                                their past lives when they transcend and acquire
                                                virtuous qualities, establish others in virtue, seek
                                                the Dharma devotedly, and teach the Dharma
                                                extensively. Bodhisattvas will be joyful, the Buddha
                                                explains, when their search is meaningful, they have
                                                the treasure of learning, they possess insight based
                                                on that learning, and they give the gift of the
                                                Dharma. Many other such sets of four qualities are
