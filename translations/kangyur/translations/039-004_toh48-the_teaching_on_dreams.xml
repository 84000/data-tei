                    bodhisattvas, but also the range of bhūmis on which those bodhisattvas
                    potentially reside, what obstacles they face, and what means they can use to
                    overcome them. Many descriptions of the individual signs also include variations
                    on the main sign that further specify the bodhisattvas’ status. This sūtra
                    offers a rare, detailed discourse on dream signs and their relation to the
                    bodhisattva path, making it a uniquely important source on bodhisattva practice
                    in Mahāyāna literature.</p>

                        this sūtra the Buddha explains the signs that may appear in the dreams of
                        individuals on the bodhisattva path. One hundred and eight dream signs are
                        listed and described in the text, each revealing a bodhisattva’s level of
                        attainment, the obstacles they may face, and the means they can use to
                        overcome them. The descriptions generally follow a similar formula that
                        begins with a description of the sign, the range of bhūmis it indicates, a
                        statement about the bodhisattvas’ remaining obstacles and practices to
                        overcome them, and details on the variations of the sign related to each
                        bhūmi. The highly structured nature of <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching on
                            Dreams</title> distinguishes this sūtra as one of the most methodically
                        organized expositions of the bodhisattva’s path of training and the
                        ten-bhūmi scheme.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-004-53"> Pagel 1995,

                        Mahāyāna contexts to refer to ten stages of training and realization
                        bodhisattvas must traverse on their way to the awakening of buddhahood. The
                        sūtra does not provide details on the bhūmis and their respective practices,
                        and thus presumes an audience already familiar with the topic. Instead, the
                        sūtra describes how the content of bodhisattvas’ dreams can be interpreted
                        to determine their status on the ten bhūmis. For a more detailed treatment

                        Vajrapramardin, rises from his seat and reaffirms the gods’ request, this

                    <p tid="13">The Buddha assents to Vajrapramardin’s request and announces that he
                        will teach the assembly how to recognize practitioners of the bodhisattva
                        path according to one hundred and eight dream signs. More precisely, the
                        Buddha presents a series of signs that signal which of the bhūmis
                        bodhisattvas reside on and what they must do to progress to the higher
                        bhūmis. The sūtra begins with a list of all one hundred and eight signs,
                        followed by a detailed presentation of each. Adhering to the same general
                        pattern, each description begins with a general statement about the sign,
                        which could, for example, be seeing the Tathāgata in specific circumstances,
                        or seeing a specific place or object, or bodhisattvas witnessing themselves
                        performing certain actions, etc. While some of these dreams are part of the
                        standard dreams found in Indian manuals of dream interpretation, the vast
                        majority of them have a specific Buddhist flavor.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-004-633">Harrison 2003, pp. 136−38. See also Young
                            1999, pp. 139−40.</note> Each sign indicates a specific range of
                        bhūmis—as few as two or as many as all ten—that the dreaming bodhisattva is
                        currently on. The Buddha then explains how each sign also denotes the
                        obstacles they will still face. These obstacles fall into the two broad
                        categories, those that come from Māra’s influence, and those that come from
                        the individual’s karmic obscurations. The Buddha then prescribes courses of
                        action to remedy these impediments, which typically involve cultivating
                        diligence and other qualities conducive to the path, serving Dharma
                        teachers, and engaging in practices and actions that better orient them to
                        the bodhisattva path. In a number of instances, the Buddha also prescribes
                        the recitation of a discourse referred to as the <title xml:lang="en">Three

                        has been reached may be precisely ascertained. In this way, the formula for

                                    There are three mental virtues: a loving attitude, a generous

                                <p>King of Magadha and son of the king Bimbisāra. While he was a

                                    Devadatta, who convinced him kill his father and take the

                                    knowledge, which mistakenly perceives phenomena as real entities
                                    having real properties, wisdom perceives the emptiness of
                                    phenomena, that is, their lack of intrinsic essence.</p>
