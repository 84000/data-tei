          buddhas too. This is revealed to be not only the major event that is the origin of buddhas and

          buddhas of our eon, but also the source and reason for Śākyamuni’s unsurpassed activity as a buddha.</p>

          <p tid="1235">Most of the sūtra’s narrative, recounted by the Buddha on Vulture Peak Mountain, 
            takes place in the distant past and concerns the
            cakravartin king Araṇemin, his thousand sons, his chief court priest Samudrareṇu, and
            Samudrareṇu’s followers and eighty-one sons, one of whom has sought enlightenment and become 
            the Buddha Ratnagarbha. Samudrareṇu encourages people throughout the 
            kingdom to aspire to attain enlightenment too, and eventually brings about the conditions for the king and many members of his court 
            to make their own aspirations in the presence of the Buddha Ratnagarbha.
            On these occasions the Buddha Ratnagarbha prophesies the buddhahood of the individuals concerned. He
            prohesies that King Araṇemin will become the Buddha Amitābha; that 999 of Samudrareṇu’s disciples, together with five of his
            attendants, will become the 1,004 buddhas of our Fortunate Eon;<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-2920">

          <p tid="14">The text explains how Śākyamuni is a buddha whose compassionate activity surpasses that
            of other buddhas because of the exceptionally powerful aspirations he made as Samudrareṇu in the
            presence of the Buddha Ratnagarbha. It also recounts miracles he accomplishes beyond anything
            else described in Mahāyāna Buddhist literature—such as bringing trillions of
            bodhisattvas into his body—and narratives of other previous lifetimes in which his
            generosity and self-sacrifice are unparalleled. </p>

          <p tid="1241">It therefore counters the seemingly justifiable notion that buddhas such as Amitābha
          and Akṣobhya, who dwell for many eons in their pure buddhafields, have qualities greater than those of Śākyamuni, 
          whose life was much shorter and whose buddhafield—this Sahā world—appears so rough and impure. That Śākyamuni deliberately 
          vowed to attain enlightenment and teach the hard-to-train beings in such a difficult environment is the
          very measure of his extraordinary compassion and exceptional activity.</p>

            (“one who has attained complete buddhahood”) sets a bodhisattva’s course toward
            attaining buddhahood in a world where the Dharma does not already exist, or once existed but has disappeared, and then teaching there. This
            stands in contrast with pratyekabuddhas, who on attaining realization in a world
            without the Dharma remain in solitude and do not teach. While pratyekabuddhas 
            complete the process leading to their realization independently, without necessarily having recourse to guidance from
            others, buddhas arise not as individuals in isolation but as the final outcome of a long process over lifetimes of 
            being inspired, taught, and guided by
            previous buddhas. Indeed, the idea that buddhas have arisen and will arise one after another over time 
            is the logical corollary of that notion of lineage.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-1109">Consequently, although 
              the notion of multiple buddhas arising over time, as well as over space, is most fully developed in the Mahāyāna

          <p tid="1250">The process through which buddhas inspire ordinary beings to become first bodhisattvas, then buddhas themselves, 
            is seen as being spread over very long periods spanning many eons.
            Its successive stages are defined in many different ways,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-2313">In essence 
              the process begins with a period in which an individual accumulates merit independently, followed by the first
            vow to attain awakening, made in the presence of a buddha; the subsequent prophecy of awakening, made by the same or another,
            later buddha; a long period of maturation during which the six (or more) perfections are practiced and the
            successive bodhisattva levels are traversed; the attainment of a stage of irreversible progress leading to inevitable awakening;
            being anointed as the next buddha to come by the preceding buddha; taking birth in the Heaven of Joy; and being reborn in
            the lifetime during which awakening as a tathāgata will occur. The
              stages of a bodhisattva’s practice are the topic of numerous scriptures, treatises, and commentaries, some in vast detail such
              as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddha­vataṃsaka­sūtra</title> (Toh 44) and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Yogācārabhūmi</title>

              and Salomon 2018, pp. 276–279.</note> but perhaps 
            the most crucial stage of all is the moment when the bodhisattva takes a fully developed aspirational vow, in the presence of a buddha,
            to attain the state of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samyaksam­buddha</foreign> in a particular way and 
            under specified conditions. This text’s principal focus is how that stage was accomplished by the Buddha Śakyamuni in
          the previous life recounted here.</p>
          <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-9"/>
          <p tid="13">The expression “highest, most complete enlightenment” is repeated many times in the sūtra, and in
            one sense (the aspect of the wisdom realized) complete buddhahood is always the same. However, the extent of what a given buddha can 
            achieve in terms of enlightened activity for beings (the aspect of the compassion deployed) varies widely, and is determined solely by 
            the power and particularities of the aspirations made in previous lives while a bodhisattva. The sūtra’s main import is to
            explain how, because of his aspirations, the Buddha Śākyamuni is even greater than most of the many other buddhas and bodhisattvas
            who have previously appeared, despite their long lives and the pure realms in which they have manifested. 
            Indeed, Śākyamuni’s short life and the impurity of his realm are
            the very signs of his superiority. The sūtra goes so far as to say that in comparison to him even famous bodhisattvas
            such as Avalokiteśvara are undeserving of the title <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mahāsattva</foreign> 
            (“great being”) because of their choice to eventually
            become buddhas in pure realms. In this sūtra, only eight bodhisattvas are said to make the vow to be buddhas
            with a short life in a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kaliyuga</foreign>—a time
            of the five degeneracies—one of whom is Śākyamuni. The identities of the other seven, along with those of a
            considerable number of other personages, are unique to this sūtra and are mentioned nowhere
            else. </p>

            have been found, but the earliest versions of the sūtra in a form close to the one translated here survive
            in the form of two Chinese translations made in the early fifth century. The eighth or ninth century Tibetan 
            translation is the next oldest version, and the several Sanskrit manuscripts from Nepal are the most recent,

            in its more or less complete form are thus the two fifth-century Chinese translations, 
            one by an anonymous translator (Taishō 158), which the Japanese scholar Isshi Yamada 
            believes predates the other, by Dharmakṣema (Taishō 157), made in 
            419 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-28018">Taishō 158:

            bibliography written in 730 by Zhi Seng claims that the sūtra was first translated by
            Dharmarakṣa (ca. 230–317), and that there was also another lost translation by Dao Gong
            made between 401 and 412. However, Yamada’s research shows the first attribution to have been a
            misunderstanding of the earlier Seng Min bibliography, which also records that the
            Dharmakṣema translation had been mistakenly ascribed to Dao Gong. See Yamada 1967, vol. 1, pp. 15–20.</note> 
            However, it is possible that, like other Mahāyāna sūtras, <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of Compassion</title> 
            started as a compilation of earlier, shorter sūtras, or at least included elements 
            found in other shorter texts.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-28019"> The opening
            section that features the Buddha Padmottara seems to have only a tenuous connection to
            the main body of the text. There are also some internal inconsistencies, such as an
            unexplained name change for King Araṇemin.</note> Indeed, Chinese bibliographies have listed about
            twenty texts that could have inspired the formation of this sūtra. These texts were
            translated by Zhi Qian (active 223–53 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>), Dharmarakṣa

            Conversely, because certain other prominent bodhisattvas, such as Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, Ākāśagarbha, Kṣitigarbha, and
            Vajrapāṇi, do not appear in the text, it may have appeared in writing before 
            these figures had risen to their full prominence in the Mahāyāna tradition. From the perspective 
            of its wider cultural context, <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of Compassion</title>
            also seems to have appeared after the emergence in India of Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism and of
            Maheśvara and Nārāyaṇa (as Śiva and Viṣṇu are normally referred to in Buddhist texts) as
            prominent deities.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-28020"> The buddhas are said to teach beings who have faith in Maheśvara by
            appearing to them in the form of Maheśvara. The sūtra seems to take a sympathetic view
            of Vaiṣṇavism in particular. For example, when Samudrareṇu makes his buddhahood
            contingent on a variety of good things occurring, he says, “If beings who have faith in
            Nārāyaṇa fall into the lower existences when they die, then may I be unable to
            accomplish all the deeds of a buddha.” Nārāyaṇa is also used as a positive example for
            power, as when King Araṇemin prays, “May those beings have the power of Nārāyaṇa.” The
            names of several samādhis and buddhas that are given also incorporate the name Nārāyaṇa,
            such as Nārāyaṇavijitagarbha.</note>

          <p tid="25">Both the versions of the Tibetan in different Kangyurs, and the Sanskrit manuscripts, 
            contain numerous variants, particularly in the long dhāraṇīs. For some texts the most plausible variant
            in the Tibetan can be determined by comparison with the Sanskrit, but in this case the earliest Sanskrit manuscript 
            now available to us dates from as late as the eighteenth century, 
            making such assumptions risky. The successive copying of the Sanskrit manuscripts, many of which were augmented with
            additional material, has resulted in an accumulation of variations.  </p>

          <p tid="26">Since the Chinese translations represent the earliest recorded form of <title xml:lang="en">The 
              White Lotus of Compassion</title>, the Tibetan an intermediate stage, and
            the Sanskrit manuscripts its latest form, it is no surprise that the Tibetan translation sometimes
            agrees with the Chinese and sometimes with the Sanskrit. The introductory passage in the sūtra is significantly longer in
            present Sanskrit manuscripts, and the Sanskrit preserves an occasional word,
            or in one place an entire sentence, that appears to have been inadvertently omitted in
            the Tibetan version. These omissions have been restored in this translation when
            necessary for a clear narrative. There are a few places where an evident
            omission predates even the Chinese translation (as when four names are given for five
            deities, in which case a correction has not been possible). At times the Tibetan can be
            opaque in meaning compared to the Sanskrit because the specificities of
            Sanskrit grammar have been lost; the Sanskrit has therefore been invaluable in seeing what the
            Tibetan translator was attempting to reproduce. While the Sanskrit of this sūtra has
            probably been increasingly standardized over time, it still retains many features of
            hybrid Sanskrit, which is a Middle Indic language that has been converted in varying
            degrees to conform to classical Sanskrit. The result is that there are numerous words in
            the sūtra that do not appear in any Sanskrit dictionary, or, if they do, have a
            different meaning there. Franklin Edgerton’s <title xml:lang="en">Buddhist
              Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary </title>(1953) is particularly helpful. With the
            exception of well-known persons and places, proper nouns in Middle Indic forms are given
            as they appear in the Sanskrit witness and have not been standardized according to the
            rules of classical Sanskrit.</p>

          <p tid="27">One particular challenge has been the translation of the nomenclature of
            plants, trees, jewels, and so on. In the Tibetan translation many of these are simply
            transliterations of the Sanskrit. For instance, in a description common to a number of
            sūtras, the ground is said to be as soft as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kācalindika</foreign>. 
            This was transliterated into Tibetan, and Sanskrit
            dictionaries offer only that it is a kind of bird. Fortunately, descriptions of the bird
            in other sources such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­pari­nirvāṇa Sūtra</title>
            specify that <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kācalindika</foreign> is the down
            made from the bar-headed goose, flocks of which are widespread throughout India and
            spend the monsoon in the Himalayas and Tibet, and which is said to have the most
            exceptional down of all geese. Nevertheless, in many other cases no outside sources
            could be found, and several terms remain mysteries.</p>

          <p tid="28">There are numerous
            place and personal names in the sūtra, and fortunately in nearly every case there is a
            clear correspondence between the Tibetan and Sanskrit. Despite scribal corruptions and discrepancies between manuscripts, the Sanskrit 
            texts were invaluable in supplying the numerous Sanskrit names of individuals. When 
            the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions vary, the Chinese translations have been
            useful in determining which version was likely the original form. Isshi Yamada, who created a critical Sanskrit edition from five
            Sanskrit manuscripts, notes the differences between those Sanskrit manuscripts, the
            Tibetan, and the two Chinese translations, and his two-volume work, which also includes his
            research into the history of the sūtra, has been an invaluable aid.</p>

            <p tid="32">The Buddha is on Vulture Peak Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha, the
              capital of Magadha, with a vast assembly of monks, bodhisattvas, and various kinds of
              deities. Ten thousand of the bodhisattvas face the southeast and pay homage to the
              Buddha Padmottara, who is in a realm called Padmā in that direction. The bodhisattva
              Ratnavairocana asks the Buddha Śākyamuni why they did this, why he and others could
              not see that buddha’s realm, and wishes to learn about him. The Buddha describes the
              beauty of Padmottara’s realm and his miraculous powers, which enable bodhisattvas to
              see him.</p>

            <p tid="34">In response to the bodhisattva Ratnavairocana’s questions, the Buddha gives
              further descriptions of Padmottara’s pure realm and its inhabitants, who are all
              bodhisattvas. He relates that previously Padmā was an impure realm called Candanā, in
              which there was the Buddha Candrottama, who had a lifespan of many eons. The Buddha
              Candrottama prophesied that after his passing, the Dharma would remain for a long
              time, but that on the very night it finally vanishes, his disciple, the bodhisattva
              Gaganamudra, would attain buddhahood and became the Buddha Padmottara. The Buddha
              Candrottama then gave the bodhisattva Gaganamudra the long dhāraṇī called
                <distinct>the form of omniscience</distinct>, which he said is given by every buddha
              to the one they choose to be their successor. When Śākyamuni repeats this dhāraṇī, the
              earth shakes, other worlds are illuminated, and bodhisattvas come from those worlds to
              Vulture Peak to receive the dhāraṇī. The Buddha describes the great benefits that come
              from reciting or even hearing it. The Buddha then continues his narrative, stating
              that when the Buddha Candrottama recited that dhāraṇī, his world also shook, other
              worlds were illuminated, and bodhisattvas came from those worlds to receive the
              dhāraṇī. Candrottama then prophesied the bodhisattva Gaganamudra’s buddhahood after ten
              intermediate eons. That night the Buddha Candrottama passed away, and the next day the
              bodhisattvas from other worlds returned to them, and those who remained entered samādhi
              for ten intermediate eons. The bodhisattva Gaganamudra continued teaching until his
              attainment of buddhahood, and as the Buddha Padmottara he also teaches the
              dhāraṇī.</p>

            <p tid="35">The Buddha Śākyamuni then explains to the bodhisattva Ratnavairocana the
              groups of four, five, and six qualities that are necessary for a bodhisattva to obtain
              the dhāraṇī.</p>

            <p tid="36">Other bodhisattvas say they have already received this dhāraṇī from vast
              numbers of buddhas. The bodhisattva Maitreya states that he received it from a buddha
              named Sālendrarāja in a buddha realm called Sarvālaṅkāravibhūṣita. Through his prayers
              he has until this time remained in saṃsāra instead of becoming a buddha and entering
              nirvāṇa, but now he has become Śākyamuni’s regent.</p>

            <p tid="37">The Buddha confirms this and repeats various mantras, each causing a
              specific kind of being to aspire to enlightenment—devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and asuras. He
              declares the rarity of the mantras and buddhas, and how all buddhas have previously
              engaged in bodhisattva conduct for trillions of eons. He then performs the miracle of
              his tongue radiating light rays throughout worlds and existences, including hells,
              bringing bliss to beings, and inspiring their devotion to him.</p>

            <p tid="39">The bodhisattva Śāntimati asks the Buddha why the other realms are pure and
              why his is impure. The Buddha answers that bodhisattvas with great compassion pray to
              become buddhas in impure realms, and that is what he had done. In the distant past,
              within this same buddha realm there was a cakravartin king, Araṇemin, who ruled over
              all four continents. His court priest was a brahmin named Samudrareṇu. His son,
              Ratnagarbha, renounced worldly life, attained buddhahood, and became the Buddha
              Ratnagarbha. When the Buddha Ratnagarbha came to Jambūvana Park, which was near King
              Araṇemin’s residence, the king, his principal queen, princes, minor kings, and
              millions of people came and made vast offerings to the Buddha and his bhikṣus for
              three months. The king’s thousand sons each also made such offerings for three months,
              beginning with the crown prince Animiṣa.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-37"/>
            <p tid="40">Meanwhile, the Buddha Ratnagarbha’s father, the court priest Samudrareṇu,
              went throughout all Jambudvīpa so that everyone in the world became his disciple and
              followed the Mahāyāna path. When the thousand princes had completed their offerings,
              they prayed for 250 years, wishing for various results—to become deities, to become
              wealthy, or to follow the Śrāvakayāna.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-38"/>
            <p tid="41">The court priest Samudrareṇu wonders what they have prayed for and has a
              dream in which he is blessed by the buddhas and receives lotuses from them, but he
              sees the king and the princes with animal faces, eating animals and then being eaten
              themselves by other animals. He sees other princes in a carriage on a bad road leading
              south, which is an inauspicious direction. Śakra and Brahmā then tell him to give his
              lotuses to the king and princes. On waking he realizes that the king and princes must
              have had inferior aspirations when they prayed. He goes to the Buddha Ratnagarbha and
              describes his dream, and the Buddha explains its meaning, prophesying Samudrareṇu’s
              buddhahood and describing the inferior aspiration of the king and princes. </p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-39"/>
            <p tid="42">Samudrareṇu, aided by miraculous manifestations by the Buddha Ratnagarbha,
              persuades King Araṇemin to pray for buddhahood, and he goes into seclusion to
              contemplate what kind of realm he should pray for.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-40"/>
            <p tid="43">Similarly, Samudrareṇu inspires all the princes, minor kings, and millions
              of other beings to go into solitude for seven years to contemplate their aspiration
              for buddhahood.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-41"/>
            <p tid="44">Samudrareṇu also inspires the four mahārāja deities in each of the billion
              worlds of this world realm and the beings they rule over—yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, nāgas,
              and gandharvas—to aspire to enlightenment and make offerings to the Buddha
              Ratnagarbha. He does the same for a billion of the principal devas in the five
              paradises of the desire realm, the five principal asuras, the māra Pūrṇa, Brahmā, and
              all the beings who are their subjects. He prays that if his aspiration for
              enlightenment were to be fulfilled, the Buddha Ratnagarbha would perform a miracle to
              emanate a buddha to each animal, preta, and being in hell and relieve them of
              suffering. The Buddha Ratnagarbha, knowing his father’s thoughts, accomplishes this
              miracle.</p>

              Meruśikhariṃdhara who prayed to be a buddha when beings lived for a hundred years. He
              taught for forty-five years and became the Buddha
              Jñāna­kusumaviraja­samucchraya­bodhīśvara. After his passing, even those
              disciples—male and female, ordained and lay—who had poor conduct while his Dharma
              remained, irreversibly progressed to enlightenment because of perceiving him as their
              teacher. Mahākāruṇika thus makes a similar aspiration that all who have devotion to
              him will be similarly benefited. The Buddha Ratnagarbha places his hand on
              Mahākāruṇika’s head, and Mahākāruṇika transforms into a twenty-year-old, and the

            <p tid="85">The Buddha Ratnagarbha teaches Mahākāruṇika a long list of samādhis that are
              practiced by bodhisattvas, and the qualities that they develop. A vast number attain
              realization on hearing this, and the king, the princes, 80,000 minor kings, and
              920,000,000 other beings take ordination. Mahākāruṇika receives all the teachings from
              the Buddha Ratnagarbha and builds his stūpa when he has passes into nirvāṇa. Then,
              after one week, he and 84,000 beings take ordination, and he teaches the Dharma for a
              thousand years. When he passes away, Ratnagarbha’s Dharma comes to an end, and the
              bodhisattvas proceed to other lives they had prayed for. Mahākāruṇika is born in
              another world as a caṇḍāla, the lowest status of a human, and threatens to murder
              anyone who committed bad actions and to support those who did good. Eventually he
              becomes King Puṇyabala, ruling over all four continents and bringing everyone to the
              path of good actions. Then someone asks him for his skin and eyes to perform a rite.
              He gives them, dying without regret after seven days. </p>

            <p tid="86">The narrative then returns to the present, and Śākyamuni explains that he
              was Mahākāruṇika and Puṇyabala and for many lifetimes practiced generosity as no one
              else has. He tells of six other worthy beings who have or will be buddhas in
              kaliyugas. There are four in the past and two in the future: </p>

            <p tid="93">The Buddha says that he was the one who caused all six first to aspire to
              buddhahood. He then recounts that he prompted these aspirations when he was a
              cakravartin named Durdhana. These figures were his six sons who developed the
              aspiration for buddhahood. First, he had a thousand other sons whom he inspired to
              take ordination in the teachings of the Buddha Gandhapadma, which continued after his
              passing. Those other six sons refused to become bhikṣus, explaining that this was the
              age during which only the outer form of the Dharma survived and thus it would be
              pointless. However, they agreed that they would develop the aspiration for buddhahood
              if Durdhana gave them the kingdom. He gladly divided his kingdom among them and took
              ordination himself. Yet their conflicts caused all the plants, fruits, and harvests to
              fail, and the animals were in great distress. Therefore, the former king threw himself
              from a mountain with the prayer that his flesh and blood would satisfy beings. His
              body became vast with many heads, all inviting beings to come and feed on him. The
              beings who consumed him developed the aspiration for the Buddhist vehicles or a good
              rebirth. His body kept growing, and he fed beings for ten thousand years. Through the
              strength of his prayer he does the same in innumerable worlds.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-68"/>
            <p tid="94">Much later, in this world realm he was again a cakravartin who divided his
              kingdom among his five hundred sons and went to meditate in the forest. Through his
              clairvoyance he saw a merchant ship in distress and guided the merchants to safety by
              burning his own hand as a lamp for seven days. Then he prayed to become a merchant who
              finds a wish-fulfilling jewel and causes a rain of jewels to fall seven times on lands
              where there is no Dharma. Eons later in this realm, he became a brahmin teacher of the
              Vedas who arranged for the deities to create a medical treatise by which he was able
              to heal countless beings and bring them to the three Buddhist vehicles.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-69"/>
            <p tid="95">At a later time in another world, he was again a cakravartin king who gave
              away jewels and prayed to be reborn seven times as a nāga king in each continent to
              reveal treasures to beings. When he made this prayer, deities appeared in the sky and
              gave him the name Sarvaṃdada (“The One Who Gives Away Everything”), and upon hearing
              that, people came to him and asked for his family and parts of his body, and for his
              kingdom to give to a young brahmin who had asked for it. He gave away his hands, feet,
              eyes, ears, genitals, flesh, and blood. His still-living body was thrown into a
              charnel ground where animals ate it. Through his prayers his body became vast, and he
              was able to feed the animals for a thousand years. Then he was reborn seven times, as
              he had prayed, as a nāga king who bestowed trillions of treasures on people and
              brought them to the practice of the three Buddhist vehicles.</p>

            <p tid="96">In a later age, in this realm, he became a fierce yakṣa who said he would
              eat beings who committed bad actions, terrifying them into following a good path, and
              he did the same in countless other worlds.</p>

            <p tid="98">The Buddha next states that he can see countless buddhas in other worlds,
              all of whom he set upon the path. He lists the names of a number of those buddhas and
              their realms. The first buddha he mentions is Vimalateja­guṇa­rāja in the realm of
              Saṃpuṣpita in the east. At that moment, that buddha’s seat shakes, and he explains to
              his disciples that this is because of the Buddha Śākyamuni—the one who set him on the
              path to buddhahood— teaching in a realm far to the west of them. </p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-72"/>
            <p tid="99">Then hundreds of thousands of his bodhisattva disciples wish to go to see
              Śākyamuni, and Vimalateja­guṇa­rāja miraculously shows them where Śākyamuni is. They
              see so many bodhisattvas there that they think there will be no room for them, and
              they also realize that Śākyamuni is looking directly at them. Vimalateja­guṇa­rāja
              explains that Śākyamuni can see everywhere and can appear and teach in any form
              according to people who have faith in him. He also says that there will be room for
              them and recounts a time when Śakyamuni was meditating in a cave and filled it with
              his body. When millions of bodhisattvas came to see him, he made the cave large enough
              for them all. Another time Śakra came to the cave to have his life extended, and he
              brought with him the gandharva Pañcaśikha so that his music would prompt the Buddha to
              rise from his samādhi. Upon hearing the music, he entered a samādhi that caused many
              yakṣas and other beings to come to the cave, and the cave became vast enough so that
              they could all come inside. He also said that his body is so vast that its top cannot
              be seen, and even the dimensions of one of his body pores cannot be known by those who
              go in and out of them. His realm is also immeasurably vast. Then he sends his
              disciples with flowers as an offering to Śākyamuni. They arrive and state why they
              have come.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-73"/>
            <p tid="100">Śākyamuni then describes that the same has occurred in all the realms in
              the ten directions. When all the bodhisattvas arrive, Śākyamuni miraculously makes
              them a yojana in height, and they can see nothing but Śākyamuni. All the flowers that
              are offered enter Śākyamuni’s pores, and everyone in the world can see nothing but his
              pores, which are like parks, and they enter them. The bodhisattva Maitreya declares
              that they are all in the Buddha’s body. Then they all pay homage, and he teaches them
              the ways to develop <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhyāna</foreign> and
              realize fearlessness. Then they all come out of the Buddha’s pores and return to their
              own realms.</p>
            <tei:milestone xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-74"/>
            <p tid="101">The bodhisattva Vaiśāradyasamuddhāraṇi asks what this sūtra should be
              called, and the Buddha gives ten alternate titles, the tenth being <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of Compassion</title>. He then describes the vast
              merit that comes from reading it, hearing it, writing it, and so on. He asks who he
              should entrust the sūtra to, and Maitreya brings to him a yakṣa sage named Merupuṇya.
              The Buddha tells the yakṣa to keep the sūtra and recite it so that it can be heard
              during the final five hundred years of the Dharma. The yakṣa who has been practicing
              the path to enlightenment for eons vows to teach this sūtra to beings in the last five
              hundred years of the Dharma.</p>

              There are two ways to interpret this traditional beginning of a sūtra, with such

            ago—in that age, at that time, this buddha realm was called Arajamerujugupsita. In that
            great eon, when the lifespan of beings was a hundred years, in the time of the outer
            image of the Dharma of the Tathāgata Gandhapadma, I, noble sons, at that time became a
            powerful cakravartin named Durdhana who was victorious over Jambudvīpa. <ref cRef="F.274.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-050-003-2078"/> I had a thousand sons, and
            I made them aspire to the highest enlightenment. They later left home and took
            ordination in the teaching of the Tathāgata Gandhapadma, and they made the teaching of
            the Tathāgata Gandhapadma shine brightly. There were six sons who did not take
            ordination and who did not wish to develop the aspiration for enlightenment. I commanded
            them repeatedly, saying, ‘What are you thinking that makes you not take ordination or
            develop the aspiration for enlightenment?’ They replied, ‘We will not take ordination.
            What is the reason? It is because in the age of degeneracy, when there is only the outer
            image of the Dharma, those who take ordination will not be able to maintain the entire
            array of good conduct. They will be devoid of the seven riches, sink in the swamp of
            saṃsāra, and occasionally obtain the splendor of devas and humans, but otherwise they
            will always wander in the three lower existences. They will not be able to truly
            maintain the training of the Buddha. Therefore, we will not take ordination.’</p>

            and engaged in disputes. Through the power of my strength in defeating opponents, I
            taught them the Dharma that the aggregates were the enemies, and I taught them to
            examine the sensory bases that are like an empty village, arising and ceasing in
            accordance with dependent origination, and to focus on mindfulness of inhalation and
            exhalation. I made them dedicate the good roots from developing the aspiration for the

            fighting, quarreling, and enmity and went to stay in the forests, where they ate the
            plants and fruit of the forest, meditated in dhyāna, and remained in the brahmavihāras

              Sanskrit presents interpretive problems. Though the general meaning is clear, the

              while the context and syntax suggest that the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">viḍacarakamūrdhani</foreign> is the name of a place, it is not entirely implausible
              that it refers to the title of a specific treatise. This is how Yamada (1967, p. 111)
              seems to interpret it. As is clearer in the following paragraph, however, it is most
              likely a toponym. Whether it refers to a text or a place, the setting and terminology
              is significant. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">caraka</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">spyod pa</foreign>) is also the name of the compiler of the

                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Carakasaṃhitā</title> is, like the śāstra described in this

              <term type="definition">In chapter 4 of this text (see <ptr target="#UT22084-050-003-1333"/>) the Buddha Ratnagarbha states that bodhisattvas
                who have vowed to attain awakening under relatively easier circumstances do not
                deserve the title <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahāsattva</foreign>, which should be
                reserved for those like Mahākāruṇika who have vowed to attain awakening only in the
                most degenerate and difficult times and places. However, this statement is best
                taken as highlighting a specific point of perspective rather than as a general
                gloss, since throughout the text the term is nevertheless used—just as it is in most
                Mahāyāna sūtras—as an epithet for bodhisattvas in general regardless of their
                individual status, qualities, or aspirations.</term>

                in an earlier eon than the Bhadraka eon, and therefore Śākyamuni is more commonly
                referred to as the fourth buddha. In <title xml:lang="en">The White Lotus of
                  Compassion Sūtra</title>, those three buddhas are the last of thirty of the
                countless buddhas preceding Śākyamuni, and when the Buddha Ratnagarbha prophesies
                the buddhahood of Samudrareṇu’s thirty million pupils, the last three pupils,
                unnamed, are prophesied by the Buddha Ratnagarbha to become the Buddhas Vipaśyin,
                Śikhin, and Viśvabhu.</term>

              <term type="definition">Literally, “circular mass.” There are at least three
                interpretations of what this name refers to. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kṣitigarbha Sūtra</title>, it is a mountain that contains the hells. In that case
                it is equivalent to the Vaḍaba submarine mountain of fire, also said to be the
                entrance to the hells. More commonly it is the name of the outer ring of mountains
                at the edge of the flat disk that is the world, with Sumeru in the center. This is
                also equated with Vaḍaba, the heat of which evaporates the ocean so that it does not
                overflow. Jambudvīpa, the world of humans, is in this sea to Sumeru’s south.
                However, it is also used to mean the entire disk, including Meru and the paradises
                above it. The Tibetan here is just <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’khor yug</foreign>,
                but later on it is <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’khor yug gi ri</foreign>, which means
                the circle of mountains around the world.</term>
