                                        begins in the Jeta Grove as the Buddha Śākyamuni emerges
                                        from a three-month-long meditative absorption. It is
                                        revealed that while he was absorbed in this meditative
                                        state, he was actually having conversations with many other
                                        buddhas across many worlds, discussing the essential nature
                                        of all phenomena. The bulk of the text, then, consists of
                                        the Buddha Śākyamuni relaying these conversations and
                                        responding to the questions of various audience members.
                                        From these exchanges we learn that all things, ranging from
                                        ordinary flowers up to the awakening of the buddhas
                                        themselves, share a nonconceptual, ineffable basis.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">Discussions of Thus-Gone
                                                  Ones</title> takes place in the Jeta Grove at the
                                                end of the monsoon. It begins with the Buddha
                                                Śākyamuni emerging from a meditative absorption in
                                                which he has rested for the entire three-month rainy
                                                season retreat. A variety of beings arrive to pay
                                                homage and inquire what the Buddha has been occupied
                                                with in this meditative state. In response, the
                                                Buddha reveals that he has been engaged in
                                                conversation with other buddhas across a number of
                                                worlds. The text then primarily consists of the
                                                Buddha relaying those conversations to various
                                                interlocutors, beginning with Mañjuśrī, and replying
                                                to their questions about the meaning of these
                                                discussions. From their conversations, we learn that
                                                the buddhas take turns asking each other about the
                                                fundamental nature and basis of their awakening.
                                                Rather than offering direct answers to these
                                                questions, the buddhas make use of a series of
                                                equivalencies to indirectly point out the
                                                nonconceptual basis on which their awakening is
                                                founded. In order to make the point that this
                                                nonconceptual basis is in fact shared by all
                                                phenomena, they equate their awakening to a wide
                                                range of worldly phenomena, including even the
                                                ignorance of beings and various negative deeds.
                                                Thus, it appears that the central teaching of this
                                                discourse is the revelation that all phenomena,
                                                including buddhas themselves, share one fundamental
                                                basis, which is nonexistent yet simultaneously holds
                                                the potential for awakening. The Buddha Śākyamuni
                                                sums this up by saying, “Mañjuśrī, in this way
                                                awakening neither exists, nor does it not exist.
                                                Mañjuśrī, in this way all phenomena are awakening
                                                and are also not awakening.” </p>

                                        <p tid="11">While the Tibetan version has no structural
                                                divisions, the sūtra can be understood to have five
                                                parts based its narrative turns. The first part
                                                consists of a conversation between the Buddha and
                                                the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī in which the Buddha
                                                describes many of his conversations with other
                                                buddhas in other realms. In this section we learn
                                                that buddhas of the past and future also teach this
                                                sūtra at the exact spot at which the Buddha is
                                                currently teaching it. We also learn about the
                                                absorption through which the Buddha Śākyamuni is
                                                able to communicate with buddhas across various
                                                world systems. The second part consists of a visit
                                                from King Prasenajit of Kośala and his conversation
                                                with the Buddha, which includes a teaching on four
                                                important principles that a Buddhist king should
                                                observe and a teaching on the nonconceptual, empty
                                                nature of all phenomena. The third and fourth parts
                                                consist of conversations between the Buddha
                                                Śākyamuni and various members of the audience, in
                                                which they discuss the nonconceptual nature of
                                                phenomena as well as the benefits of receiving this
                                                teaching. Here the Buddha reveals that an
                                                inconceivably large numbers of buddhas who exist
                                                throughout various universes are all simultaneously
                                                expounding this very same teaching. The Buddha also
                                                reveals that the absorption from which he
                                                communicates with the other buddhas is called
                                                  <distinct>freedom from the realm of
                                                  phenomena</distinct>. The fifth and final part of
                                                the teaching begins with student named Heart of the
                                                Glorious Lotus making an offering of his
                                                understanding of the Buddha’s teaching on the
                                                inconceivable nature of phenomena. In response to
                                                questioning from Śāriputra, he causes himself to
                                                disappear in order to demonstrate the way words are
                                                merely symbolic designations used to describe things
                                                that do not exist in any ultimate sense. </p>

                                        <p tid="12">Historically we know very little about this
                                                text. To the best of our knowledge, a Sanskrit
                                                version of this sūtra is no longer extant. It also
                                                appears that it was never translated into Chinese.
                                                Hence, the only witness we have today is the Tibetan
                                                translation that was included in the Kangyur. In the
                                                absence of any Sanskrit manuscript or Chinese
                                                translation, it is difficult to determine much about
                                                the history of this scripture in India and East
                                                Asia, or to evaluate its importance in Buddhist
                                                India besides taking note of the fact that its
                                                absence in the Chinese canon may indicate a
                                                relatively narrow circulation in India. </p>

                                                Just as all phenomena are, so too are the acts of

                                                teachings of the thus-gone ones, he must accomplish
                                                them. (3) He must be determined to pursue the Dharma
                                                out of a desire for the profound. (4) He must be
                                                determined to gain certainty about the true state by

                                                Consider how the conceptualization of impermanence
                                                is just the same as the conceptualization of

                                                How, then, could one determine the edge? Great king,
                                                where one cannot observe the middle, one cannot
                                                observe the edge. If one cannot determine the edge,
                                                one has also eliminated movement. Where movement is
                                                eliminated, no one can go. If no one can go, then no
                                                one will proceed. If no one can proceed, there can

                                                  phenomena</distinct>? Great king, phenomena do not
                                                abide. That ‘nonabiding’ has been unobservable since
                                                the very beginning, and even the beginning is
                                                unobservable. What is without an observable basis is
                                                also without observable going or coming. What is
                                                without an observable becoming is known as
                                                  <distinct>the space of emptiness</distinct>. Great
                                                king, why is that space unobservable? If a space is
                                                observed within a space, it becomes the space
                                                itself. Great king, in that way, childish beings
                                                will run toward liberation. Great king, why is it
                                                called <distinct>liberation</distinct>? Liberation
                                                is inexhaustible. Those who run toward the
                                                inexhaustible will become exhausted. Those who are
                                                exhausted will become utterly exhausted. Those who
                                                become utterly exhausted are weakened. How are they
                                                weakened? They are weakened with respect to the true
                                                nature. Those who are weakened are distant from the
                                                gateways to liberation. Great king, why are they
                                                called <distinct>gateways</distinct>? They are
                                                gateways because they are well disposed toward two
                                                sides. Great king, this use of the term
                                                  <distinct>gateway of liberation</distinct> is a

                                                understand. Where there is nothing to be understood,
                                                there is also nothing to cognize.</p>

                                                accept and reject. How do they accept and reject?
                                                They accept and reject where there is nothing to
                                                accept and nothing to reject. Those who reject are

                                                toward awakening. They are running toward emptiness.
                                                Those who are running are distant from this teaching
                                                and far from being near to awakening. Great king,
                                                why is it called <distinct>being near</distinct>? It
                                                is neither near to awakening nor not near to it.
                                                What is awakened is not established anywhere.
                                                Therefore, it is not known as either

                                                  <distinct>awakened</distinct>? Because they are
                                                lions. What is a ‘lion’? It is to be unafraid. Why
                                                are they said to be <distinct>unafraid</distinct>?
                                                Because, great king, they have transcended fear.
                                                Great king, with regard to those who are unafraid,
                                                why are thus-gone ones called <distinct>thus-gone

                                                  <distinct>thus-gone ones</distinct> because they

                                                  <distinct>thus-gone ones</distinct>? Because they
                                                have not gone, nor have they not gone. That is why
                                                they are called <distinct>thus-gone ones</distinct>.
                                                Great king, why are discussions of buddhas known as

                                                ones</distinct>? Because buddhas understand that all
                                                phenomena are unmoving. How do they understand that?
                                                They understand it in the same way they understand
                                                that there is no coming and no going.”</p>

                                        <p tid="176">“Great king, this can be shown in the way that
                                                a mathematician operates. For example, great king,
                                                from one hundred thousand, many millions can be
                                                made. Those millions arose from that hundred
                                                thousand. Moreover, great king, even though many
                                                reflections appear in a mirror, those reflections do
                                                not exist in the mirror. Moreover, great king, even
                                                though one syllable can produce many other
                                                syllables, those syllables do not appear in that one
                                                syllable. Moreover, great king, for a monk who has
                                                great miraculous powers, one can be transformed into
                                                many, and many can become one. In the same way,
                                                great king, when the thus-gone ones have obtained
                                                the <term ref="UT22084-063-010-507">powers</term>,
                                                fearlessnesses, and all the perfections, they teach
                                                the Dharma in order to instruct beings. As they do
                                                so, they employ worldly conventions and ways of
                                                calculation to declare ‘I have trained such-and-such
                                                many beings.’ However, great king, the method of
                                                training, those who are trained, and those who do
                                                the training are actually nondual from the
                                                perspective of the thus-gone ones. <ref cRef="F.245.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-063-010-684"/> Thus, when they
                                                say, ‘Through teaching this Dharma, I have trained
                                                such-and-such many beings,’ that is the uncreated,
                                                unchanging lion’s roar.” </p>

                                                Awakening is also like that! Moreover, Mañjuśrī, I
                                                said to the thus-gone Manifested Chief Exalted King

                                                Ānanda, this Dharma teaching contains the awakening
                                                of all the buddhas. Why is that, Ānanda? Because all

                                                will work diligently to degrade this discourse.
                                                Ānanda, you must therefore examine the subtle acts

                                                acts of Māra, and you must also examine how to
                                                conquer the acts of Māra. Moreover, Ānanda, in
                                                relation to this discourse, many acts of Māra will
                                                arise. How should the distant acts of Māra be seen?
                                                Noble sons and daughters who do not understand the
                                                qualities of this discourse will say, ‘This
                                                discourse is too distant and too vast; there are too

                                                afflictions.’ Such noble sons and daughters who do

                                                Hence, they will not exert themselves in this
                                                discourse. They will not remember it, preserve it,

                                                corrupted by inauthentic teachings. Therefore, they

                                                is unborn is suchness, which is awakening.
                                                Therefore, it is awakening. For example, Mañjuśrī,
                                                past illusions do not exist, nor do future illusions

                                                existence—they lack intrinsic existence. Mañjuśrī,
                                                in the same way, past thoughts are unborn, future
                                                thoughts are unborn, and present thoughts are
                                                unborn. Awakening is like that. Mañjuśrī, awakening
                                                is not past, future, or present. Mañjuśrī, awakening
                                                is like that. In this way, Mañjuśrī, awakening is

                                                one does not encounter, are nonexistent. Whenever

                                                four? (1) Ānanda, that monk will have excessive
                                                pride. <ref cRef="F.265.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-063-010-724"/> If that monk with
                                                excessive pride hears a teaching on the absence of
                                                excessive pride, he will be scared, fearful, and
                                                frightened. He will fall into a great abyss. He will
                                                fall to bottomless depths. He will become consumed
                                                with anger at such unwelcome words. (2) Furthermore,
                                                Ānanda, that monk will be attached to the self and
                                                have no boundaries. Ānanda, the monk who is endowed
                                                with these two qualities will reject the awakening
                                                of a buddha and become consumed with anger at such
                                                unwelcome words. (3) Furthermore, Ānanda, a monk
                                                with flawed discipline will behave improperly.
                                                Because their discipline is flawed, he will become
                                                timid when he hears lectures on discipline. Ānanda,
                                                a monk who has these three qualities rejects the
                                                awakening of a buddha and is consumed with anger at
                                                such unwelcome words. (4) Furthermore, Ānanda, a
                                                monk who has a view with reference points will
                                                assert the existence of a self. If he hears lectures
                                                on emptiness, he will become scared, fearful, and
                                                frightened with regard to nonattachment. Ānanda,
                                                monks who have these four qualities reject the
                                                awakening of a buddha and are consumed with anger at
                                                such unwelcome words.”</p>
