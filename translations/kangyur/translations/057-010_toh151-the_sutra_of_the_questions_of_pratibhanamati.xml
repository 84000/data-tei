                    Buddha himself in its conclusion: <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching That Clarifies Karma</title>. In the
                        opening section, the merchant Pratibhānamati, concerned about the
                    state of society and what will become of the saṅgha in times to come, requests the Buddha
                    Śākyamuni for a teaching that offers moral guidance to future beings. With the Buddha’s
                    encouragement, he asks what actions lead to rebirth in ten different human and
                    non-human states. The Buddha answers with descriptions of the actions associated with each of these 
                    states and the effects they will bring. Pratibhānamati then invites the Buddha
                    to his home in Śrāvastī. Two beggars arrive there, and on account of their opposing
                    aspirations and conduct in the presence of the Buddha and retinue, one soon becomes
                    a king while the other is killed in an accident. The sūtra concludes as the Buddha, 
                    invited to the newly anointed king’s land, explains the karmic reasons for his
                    unexpected fortune.</p>

                <p tid="8">In this sūtra the Buddha Śākyamuni gives a teaching on the workings of karma, the
                    relationships between actions and their effects. The setting for the teaching is the Jeta Grove near
                    the city of Śrāvastī, which the benefactor Anāthapiṇḍada donated to the Buddha at great expense.
                    Prompted by questions posed by the merchant Pratibhānamati, who is concerned that monastics may
                    indulge in hypocritical behavior in the future during degenerate times, the Buddha elucidates the
                    actions that cause rebirth in ten possible states of existence: as a god, a human, a hell being, an
                    animal, a hungry spirit, a high-caste human, a slave, a fortunate human, an unfortunate human, or a
                    human on the Buddhist path. Additionally, he describes the physical, verbal, and mental traits
                    associated with each of those rebirths. These illustrate the doctrine, shared by most Indian
                    religions, that beings’ good or bad deeds determine their future modes of birth and existence. In
                    this way, the sūtra provides a moral framework geared toward the whole of society established on the
                    basis of karma theory.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-010-4"/>
                <p tid="9">Following the discourse, Pratibhānamati invites the Buddha to his home for the midday meal.
                    As a final illustration of the law of karma, we are introduced to two beggars who seat themselves
                    among the saṅgha when the midday meal is being served. One of them does not observe the proper etiquette
                    of ensuring honored guests are served first and thus is not served anything to eat or drink.
                    Enraged, he leaves, harboring a very negative judgment of the assembly and perversely vowing
                    revenge. As a result, he soon suffers an unfortunate death followed by millions of eons in hell. The
                    other beggar, however, observes proper etiquette and is served abundant food and drink. He
                    entertains a virtuous aspiration to serve the Buddha and his assembly for an entire week. The effect
                    of this noble wish is that he soon becomes the king of a neighboring land whose ruler has perished
                    without an appropriate heir. He is astounded at his sudden reversal of fortune and seeks to
                    understand its source. Through the blessings of the Buddha he realizes how his past actions
                    determined his current fortune. He therefore invites the Buddha and the saṅgha and serves them just
                    as he had aspired to do. The Buddha delivers a teaching that propels the king to the state of a
                    stream enterer. The sūtra concludes with the audience praising the Buddha and rejoicing in his
                    teaching. Through its descriptions and examples of the workings of karma, the sūtra underscores the
                    importance and benefits of upholding core Buddhist virtues of kindness, gratitude, generosity,
                    honesty, and respect, while warning of the grave consequences awaiting those who do the
                    opposite.</p>

                <p tid="10">To our knowledge there is no extant Sanskrit version of this sūtra. It was, however,
                    translated into Chinese (Taishō 544) by Fa Chang 法場 during the early sixth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Although it appears that the sūtra did exercise some influence in China,<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-057-010-6"> See Robson 2009: 30–31. The Chinese
                        translation was not referenced for this translation.</note> it does not seem to have had
                    a particularly significant impact in Tibet. The colophon to the Tibetan translation
                    states that it was produced by the Indian scholar Prajñāvarman and the Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé.

                    an entourage of five hundred servants. As they arrived at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍada’s park where
                    the Blessed One was residing, Pratibhānamati bowed his head at the Blessed One’s feet,
                    circumambulated him three times, and sat down together with his entourage. </p>

                    his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With palms together he bowed toward the
                    Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, you are the supreme teacher, the most eminent in the three
                    realms, the exalted ground for the merit of awakening, the one who liberates all beings, and the one
                    who brings about the attainment of unbounded skill in all-pervasive methods. Thus, Blessed One, in
                    times to come, during the degenerate age when the five polluting degenerations manifest, the three poisons
                    will burn and blaze forth. Then, among those beings who inflict misery on one another there will be

                    the other beggar, who was lying there fast asleep. From then on, the meritorious man lived as the

                    development, well-being, and good harvests, and the land was filled with people and other beings.
                    The king’s name became associated with being richly endowed with all positive qualities.</p>

                    They collectively prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One and the assembly of monks. The king and

                    his plate and wash his hands. Then, for the purpose of hearing the Dharma, he sat down with his
