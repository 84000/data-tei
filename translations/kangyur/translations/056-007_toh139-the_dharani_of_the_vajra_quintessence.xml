                <p tid="2">In <title xml:lang="en">The Dhāraṇī of the Vajra Quintessence</title>, the bodhisattva of
                    wisdom Mañjuśrī asks the Buddha to propound a teaching on the highest wisdom that questions
                    foundational Buddhist concepts and categories from an ultimate standpoint without denying their
                    conventional efficacy. The Buddha begins by teaching, in a paradoxical tone that defines the entire
                    discourse, that although there is neither awakening nor buddha qualities, bodhisattvas nonetheless
                    aspire for buddhahood. This is followed by a lengthy series of similar paradoxes that examine basic
                    Buddhist distinctions between the worlds of buddhas and sentient beings while pointing to the common
                    ground underlying them. One key doctrinal point is that the qualities of ordinary people are neither
                    distinct from, nor to be conflated with, the qualities of buddhas. When asked why this is so, the
                    Buddha explains that the <distinct>dhāraṇī of the vajra quintessence</distinct> is nonconceptual and
                    immanent in all things, from emotional defilements up to the realization of buddhahood. Since all
                    phenomena are equally empty of intrinsic essence, they are already intrinsically pure and beyond
                    bondage or liberation.</p>

                        works of this class, usually short Mahāyāna sūtras or tantric texts, are found in

                        own Compendium of Dhāraṇīs section of two hundred and sixty-four texts (Tohoku nos. 846–1108). The present scripture,
                        however, is included only in the General Sūtra section and is not duplicated in the compendium. This particular text
                        is not a dhāraṇī in the sense in which that term is applied to a large number of scriptures
                        containing a specific mantra-like formula recited in order to bring about a desired result. It
                        contains no such formula at all, but rather presents a series of specific dhāraṇī that
                        constitute spiritual qualities or forms of spiritual realization. First and foremost among these
                        is the <distinct>dhāraṇī of the vajra quintessence</distinct>, which is presented as the
                        ultimate mode of being or state of realization that eludes all conceptual appropriation while at
                        the same time being immanent in all things.</p>

                        monks, gods, and celestial bodhisattvas have assembled to receive teachings from the Buddha. The
                        Buddha’s main interlocutor throughout the teaching is the bodhisattva of wisdom, Mañjuśrī. The
                        central discourse of the text is preceded by several miracles, great and small. First, the
                        Buddha enters a special meditative state that renders him invisible to his audience. He then
                        summons all the followers of the Mahāyāna in the universe and they miraculously assemble in the
                        sky. At this point, the great bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī, Maitreya, Ratnaketu, and Avalokiteśvara
                        each enter special meditative absorptions that evoke miraculous changes in the minds of their
                        audience. Finally, the Buddha emits a vast array of multicolored light rays and proceeds to
                        smile, with brilliant light rays emanating from his mouth. When asked by Mañjuśrī what has
                        pleased him, the Buddha says that he is smiling because ten thousand buddhas in the sky have
                        taught the <distinct>dhāraṇī of the vajra quintessence</distinct>. Mañjuśrī then requests the
                        Buddha to teach that same dhāraṇī to all the assembled bodhisattvas, and the remainder of the
                        text consists of the Buddha’s teaching and his intermittent replies to Mañjuśrī’s many questions
                        on important doctrinal points.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-007-10"/>
                    <p tid="12">From the outset, the teaching is strikingly enigmatic. The Buddha begins by warning his
                        audience, in a paradoxical tone that defines the entire discourse, that although there is
                        neither awakening nor buddha qualities in this dhāraṇī—understood here as both a type of
                        discourse and a type of nondual realization—bodhisattvas nonetheless strive for buddhahood.
                        There follows a lengthy series of similar paradoxes, which call into question basic Buddhist
                        distinctions between the “worlds” of buddhas and sentient beings. One key doctrinal point in all
                        this is that the qualities of ordinary people are neither distinct from, nor to be conflated
                        with, the qualities of buddhas. When asked why this is so, the Buddha explains that the
                            <distinct>dhāraṇī of the vajra quintessence</distinct> is nonconceptual and immanent in all
                        things, from emotional defilements up to the realization of buddhahood. Moreover, since all
                        phenomena are equally empty of any intrinsic essence, they are all already intrinsically pure
                        and beyond bondage or liberation.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-007-11"/>
                    <p tid="13">Next follows the first of three major sections of the sūtra, a teaching on the three
                            <distinct>bases of the dhāraṇī</distinct>, which turn out to be the three main defilements
                        of desire, anger, and confusion. Although these emotional defilements are traditionally regarded
                        as pollutants to be avoided, the Buddha explains that they do not actually exist so there is
                        nothing that becomes polluted, and therefore nothing to purify. Since they are intrinsically
                        empty, they are considered bases of the dhāraṇī or the ultimate reality that is immanent in all
                        of them.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-007-13"/>
                    <p tid="15">The second major section of the sūtra is a teaching on a series of eleven Dharma gates that are
                        also bases of the dhāraṇī, with each gate relating to a different class of sentient being. They
                        comprise the Dharma gates for gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and
                        mahoragas, as well as for a woman, for a man, and for hell beings.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-007-14"/>
                    <p tid="16">Each of these modes of being constitutes a Dharma or dhāraṇī gate because they are all
                        nominal imputations having no actual existence, and can thus facilitate the understanding of
                        emptiness. In short, for a bodhisattva who possesses this sort of dhāraṇī, a single syllable not
                        only has multiple possible references but can also open on to multiple forms of reality. In that
                        regard, all phenomena partake of this dhāraṇī and can thus become avenues for both expressing
                        and realizing the ultimate.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-056-007-15"/>
                    <p tid="17">The final main section of the sūtra expounds another set of eleven dhāraṇī gates. After
                        learning about a special gate of nonduality, we learn that one of the main gates of nonduality
                        is the teaching that ignorance is awakening. The teaching then proceeds to elucidate how each of
                        the successive twelve links of dependent origination (apart from the final link, which is
                        omitted) is equated with awakening. Although the idea of nonduality only appears in this final
                        section of the text, it is a key to understanding the overall thrust of the Buddha’s discourse.
                        For when it is understood that all phenomena are equally empty and naturally luminous, the
                        various conceptual constructs and oppositional categories we use to evaluate and distinguish the
                        real from unreal, the good from the bad, the high from the low, collapse and their unfabricated
                        source is revealed. The teaching concludes with a remarkable passage in which the Buddha
                        explains to Mañjuśrī the bodhisattva level for which this teaching is intended: it is intended
                        for “the level of those bodhisattvas who have <emph>not</emph> set out toward awakening, who
                        have <emph>not</emph> produced the intention to gain awakening, who do <emph>not</emph> see
                        buddha qualities, who do <emph>not</emph> wish to run away from desire, anger, and confusion,
                        who do <emph>not</emph> wish to go beyond saṃsāra, who do <emph>not</emph> wish to liberate
                        sentient beings, and who do <emph>not</emph> wish to realize the buddha qualities.” The work
                        then concludes with a description of the many benefits that derive from bearing this dhāraṇī in
                        mind, holding, reciting, and teaching this text and of the praises of the teaching offered by
                        the assembled audience.</p>

                        <term type="definition">In Buddhist literature, an epithet applied to buddhas, most often to Śākyamuni. The Sanskrit term generally means “possessing fortune,” but in specifically Buddhist contexts this term implies that a buddha is in possession of six auspicious qualities (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhaga</foreign>) associated with complete awakening. The Tibetan term—where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bcom</foreign> is said to refer to “subduing” the four māras, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ldan</foreign> to “possessing” the great qualities of buddhahood, and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">’das</foreign> to “going beyond” saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavat</foreign> is interpreted, in addition, as “one who destroys the four māras.” This is achieved either by reading <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavat</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagnavat</foreign> (“one who broke”), or by tracing the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhaga</foreign> to the root <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">√bhañj</foreign>, “to break.”</term>

                        <term type="definition">Cognate with the English term <emph>divine</emph>. The devas are most generally a class of divine, celestial beings who populate the narratives of Indian mythology. Devas make regular appearances in Buddhist literature at the head of the assemblies of celestial beings who attend the teachings, interact with the Buddha, bodhisattvas, and other spiritual figures, and celebrate the delivery of their teachings. In Buddhist cosmology, the devas are subdivided into numerous classes based on the specific <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">devalokas</foreign>, the “heavens” in which they reside. Traditionally there are between twenty-six and twenty-eight devalokas, divided between the desire realm (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāmadhātu</foreign>), form realm (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">rūpadhātu</foreign>), and formless realm (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ārūpyadhātu</foreign>). The state of deva is reached either through meritorious acts or the cultivation of subtle meditative states, and is therefore considered a higher mode of rebirth in comparison to rebirth among hell beings, pretas, and animals. Nonetheless, all the devalokas are within the three realms of saṃsāra and therefore transitory. Thus while the devas occupy the highest strata within the scheme of the five or six “destinies” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gati</foreign>), the realms within saṃsāra where beings take rebirth, their state is still one determined by the fetters (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saṃyojana</foreign>) that bind one to the perpetual cycle of rebirth.</term>
