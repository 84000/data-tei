                    the monk Maudgalyāyana asks him about some unusual beings he saw during an alms
                    round. The Buddha informs Maudgalyāyana that these beings are starving spirits.
                    The Buddha gives a discourse explaining how these starving spirits were once
                    humans yet committed misdeeds related to food that led them to their current
                    dismal state. The misdeeds connected with food described by the Buddha present a
                    picture of food-related prohibitions for the monastic saṅgha, such as failing to
                    eat only a single meal a day, improperly partaking of meals, carrying away
                    leftovers, and other forms of abusing food offerings. Food-related ethics are
                    also given for lay people, mainly concerning how to prepare food for the saṅgha
                    in a hygienic manner.</p>

                        begins with Maudgalyāyana asking the Buddha about some unusual beings he saw
                        while on an alms round. After describing their bizarre features, such as
                        their enormous stomachs and needle-thin throats, the Buddha informs
                        Maudgalyāyana that these beings are, in fact, starving spirits. The Buddha
                        gives a discourse explaining how these starving spirits were once humans but
                        attained this dismal state by committing misdeeds related to food. He uses
                        their example as an opportunity to describe the misdeeds and meritorious
                        actions related to food, along with their results. The first half of the
                        discourse concerns the saṅgha and monastic rules surrounding food—eating
                        only a single meal a day, participating in meals, how to treat leftovers,
                        and the way to receive offerings—that are fundamental to the Vinaya, the
                        Buddhist monastic code. The second half of the discourse concerns food
                        hygiene and is specifically directed to the laypeople who handle the
                        saṅgha’s food. To illustrate these strictures around food for both the
                        monastic and lay audiences, the Buddha describes the workings of karma with
                        vivid, sometimes graphic, imagery. These descriptions include positive
                        results, such as being blessed and protected by the entire pantheon of gods,
                        as well as negative results, such as being reborn as starving spirits who
                        consume the contents of toilets.</p>

                            Food</title> is far from certain. While the notions of purity and
                        pollution presented in the sūtra would appear to be rooted in an Indic
                        worldview, and the narrative connection between Maudgalyāyana and starving
                        spirits is common in Indic Buddhist literature,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-006-8"> See for example, Tibetan Classics

                            the Words of the Buddha, 2020), 3.215–240.</note> the sūtra is bereft of
                        the expected Sanskrit title and lacks the traditional colophon naming its
                        Indian and Tibetan translators. Thus, there is the possibility that this
                        sūtra is a “gray text,” one that is neither purely Indic in origin nor fully
                        Tibetan apocrypha. It may have been derived from Indic material in a Tibetan
                        setting rather than be a translation in the strict sense of the term. The
                        sūtra is not listed in the Denkarma (Tib. <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan/lhan
                            dkar ma</title>) or the Phangtangma (Tib. <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phang thang ma</title>) catalogs, the two surviving indexes from the
                        Imperial Period (629–841 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>). This dearth of
                        information makes it impossible to date the translation of <title xml:lang="en">Pure Sustenance of Food</title> or otherwise determine its
                        status in the Tibetan canon. There is no known Sanskrit witness of the
                        sūtra, nor does there appear to be a Chinese translation.</p>

                                the great mountain forming the axis of the universe. At its summit
                                lies Sudarśana, home of Śakra and his thirty-two gods, and on its
                                flanks live the asuras. The mount has four sides facing the cardinal
                                directions, each of which is made of a different precious stone.
                                Surrounding it are several mountain ranges and the great ocean where
                                the four great island continents lie: in the south, Jambudvīpa (our
                                world); in the west, Godānīya; in the north, Uttarakuru; in the
                                east, Pūrvavideha. Above it are the abodes of the gods of the realm
                                of desire. </term>-->
