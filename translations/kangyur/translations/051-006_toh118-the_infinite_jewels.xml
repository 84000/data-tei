                    <p tid="7">While the Buddha is residing on Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha with a large group of
                        monks, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī comes to see him. The bodhisattva inquires about the meditative
                        absorption from which the Buddha has just arisen, and the Buddha responds that the absorption is
                        known as <distinct>infinite jewels</distinct>. The sūtra then unfolds as a dialogue between the
                        Buddha and Mañjuśrī on the nature and significance of the absorption, with an additional series
                        of exchanges on this topic with the Buddha’s eminent monk-disciple Śāriputra.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-5"/>
                    <p tid="8">Because the text conveys a profound view of reality, it is fitting that the Buddha's primary interlocutor is the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, who epitomizes wisdom in the Great Vehicle tradition. The perspective of profound wisdom is elucidated through the exploration of a pair
                        of key terms: <distinct>limit of reality</distinct> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtakoṭi</foreign>) and <distinct>realm of phenomena</distinct> (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmadhātu</foreign>). These terms are meant to indicate the
                        way things are on the level of ultimate reality, and in this sūtra they are treated as synonyms.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-6"/>
                    <p tid="9">The term “limit of reality” appears in a number of sūtras, and frequently in the
                        Perfection of Wisdom literature. It stands for ultimate truth and, therefore, is synonymous with
                        reality (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmatā</foreign>) and suchness
                        (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathatā</foreign>).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-7"> This particular equation is made in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñāpāramitā­śāstra</title> attributed to Nāgārjuna (Lamotte 2001, p. 47).
                            Elsewhere in his translation of this text, Lamotte cites a number of other canonical sources
                            that provide lists of synonyms for the ultimate nature, all of which include the term
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtakoṭi</foreign> (ibid., p. 52, n. 103).
                            Grammatically, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtakoṭi</foreign> can be read as
                            both a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tatpuruṣa</foreign> and a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">karmadhāraya</foreign> compound. In support of reading it
                                as a tatpuruṣa, Ratnākaraśānti, when explaining the term in his <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Muktāvalī</title> (Toh 1189),<ref rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh1189"/> glosses <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tattva</foreign> (“reality”), and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">koṭi</foreign>
                            by <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">agra</foreign> (“edge,” “limit”) (Tripathi 2001,
                            p. 96). Both words in this compound are nouns. Lamotte also adopted this reading in his French translation of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñāpāramitā­śāstra</title>, where, in the
                            English translation of his work, the term is rendered “summit of existence” (2001, p. 47).
                            On the other hand, Edgerton (1953, p. 410) takes <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtakoṭi</foreign> to be a karmadhāraya compound, meaning “true goal” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> = “true” and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">koṭi</foreign> = “goal”). What may underlie these different interpretations
                            is the fact that the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūta</foreign> can be used
                            both as an adjective meaning “real/true” and as a noun meaning “<term type="ignore">reality</term>/truth.” In
                            this translation, we have opted to read the term as a tatpuruṣa compound.</note> While this
                        appears to be the main significance of the term, it can
                        also refer to the awakened experience of the ultimate, or even to the quiescent state of a
                        worthy one (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">arhat</foreign>) to be avoided by
                        bodhisattvas who vow to remain in cyclic existence as long as suffering beings remain.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-8"> Buswell and Lopez 2013, p. 117.</note> In the
                        present sūtra, the equation between the ultimate and the limit of reality is repeatedly
                        confirmed. In the final exchange concerning this term, we are told that it is not actually a
                        limit, per se. In general, a limit must be localizable, but since the limit of reality
                        transcends location, it is not truly a limit in the ordinary sense of the word.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-9"/>
                    <p tid="10">The discussion regarding the realm of phenomena focuses on the fact that distinctions
                        and designations are mere imputations having no ultimate, independent existence. According to
                        this sūtra, in the context of the realm of phenomena, one cannot speak meaningfully of the
                        traits of ordinary beings as distinct from those of buddhas, or of distinct psycho-physical
                        aggregates that make up persons, or of defilements or heinous acts that can be
                        isolated and identified. Instead, the realm of phenomena is described as nondual, and notions of
                        birth, death, transmigration, pollution, and purification are moot. Thus, it is mainly by way of
                        commentary on the terms <distinct>limit of reality</distinct> and <distinct>realm of phenomena</distinct> that the sūtra seeks to convey the profound nature of the ultimate.
                        The discourse ends with a praise of these teachings and a description of the benefits that
                        result from engaging with them.</p>

                    <p tid="11">A key challenge of translation is that frequently there does not exist a single term in
                        the target language that embodies the range of meaning of a particular term in the source
                        language. Such is the case with the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">koṭi</foreign>, which appears both in the title, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Ratnakoṭi</foreign>, and in <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhūtakoṭi</foreign>, the
                        limit of reality. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Koṭi</foreign> can mean limit, end,
                        apex, point, highest point, eminence, or excellence. It can also refer to the number ten
                        million. Thus, the title of our sūtra could be translated in a number of ways. We have chosen
                        “Infinite Jewels” for two reasons. The first is to be found in the Buddha’s own explanation of
                        the title of this sūtra, which refers to a particular meditative absorption entered by the
                        Buddha. When Mañjuśrī asks why the absorption is so named, the Buddha likens it to an
                        unblemished jewel. When such a jewel is placed on an even surface, there appear untold
                            millions<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-11"> Here the text alludes to the sense of
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">koṭi</foreign> as “ten million” (rendered as
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bye ba</foreign> in Tibetan). The term used here
                            is <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">che bye ba</foreign>, which may translate <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mahākoṭi</foreign>, a term having the sense of vast or
                            untold millions.</note> of other “jewels” surrounding it (presumably due to light refracting
                        in the facets of the jewel). Secondly, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title>, the
                        seminal list of Sanskrit–Tibetan terminological equivalents, renders <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">ratnakoṭir nāma samādhiḥ</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">rin chen mtha’ yas zhes bya ba’i ting nge ’dzin</foreign>, “the meditative absorption

                            Interestingly, Saerji (2011) has argued that this sūtra and the shorter <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Samādhi­cakrasūtra</title> (Toh 241) <ref rend="pending" target="http://read.84000.co/translation/toh241"/> are

                        be the translator of this sūtra and has instead proposed that the translation may have been done
                        by another early translator, the Gandhāran monk Lokakṣema (147–? <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-051-006-14"> Karashima 2015, p. 119.</note> In

                                conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways,
                                but in general it implies one who has departed in the wake of the buddhas of the past,

                                Śākyamuni. The Sanskrit term generally means “possessing fortune,” but in specifically
                                Buddhist contexts this term implies that a buddha is in possession of six auspicious
                                qualities (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhaga</foreign>) associated with
                                complete awakening. The Tibetan term—where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bcom</foreign> is said to refer to “subduing” the four māras, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ldan</foreign> to “possessing” the great qualities of
                                buddhahood, and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">’das</foreign> to “going beyond”
                                saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskrit
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavat</foreign> is interpreted, in
                                addition, as “one who destroys the four māras.” This is achieved either by reading
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavat</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagnavat</foreign> (“one who broke”), or by tracing the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhaga</foreign> to the root <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">√bhañj</foreign>, “to break.”</term>

The term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’jig tshogs</foreign> (“transitory collection”; Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">satkāya</foreign>, literally “real assemblage”) here alludes to the belief in a real person (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">satkāyadṛṣti</foreign>) or, more specifically, the view that the aggregates constitute a real person. This is typically denounced as a false view in Buddhism. However, this text makes the radical claim that beginners should be taught not to reject the composite person because, as becomes clear, there is, quite literally, nothing there to reject.</term>
