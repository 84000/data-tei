                    humans. As Śākyamuni concludes his teaching, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī rises from his seat and

                    who are present in the assembly. Specifically, he asks Śākyamuni to teach them about the previous aspirations of seven buddhas, their buddhafields, and the benefits that those buddhas can bring to beings who
                    live in the final five hundred years, when the holy Dharma is on the verge of disappearing. Śākyamuni agrees to this request and proceeds to give a detailed account of the previous aspirations of those seven buddhas to
                    benefit beings who are veiled by karmic obscurations, tormented by illnesses, and plagued by mental
                    anguish and suffering.</p>

                    eight thousand monks, thirty-six thousand bodhisattvas, and a large gathering of gods, spirit

                    Śākyamuni then declares that he will give a detailed account of the previous aspirations of those
                    seven thus-gone ones to benefit beings who are veiled by karmic obscurations, tormented by
                    illnesses, and plagued by mental anguish and suffering. The medical applications of the text are
                    thus made explicit in its introduction, though of course the ends to which the text may be used
                    surpass its medical applications in curing illness and protecting devotees from demonic possession. </p>

                <p tid="191">Each of the seven thus-gone ones is said to dwell in the East in his own buddhafield, where
                    each one lives and teaches the Dharma. The names of the seven thus-gone ones and their buddhafields
                    are as follows:<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-087-008-278"> Aside from
                        Supari­kīrtita­nāma­dheyaśrī­rāja, who appears in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Śikṣāsamuccaya</title>, and Bhaiṣajyaguru, the other five names of these thus-gone ones are
                        sourced from Davidson 2015, who relies upon Chandra 1999. Chandra cites Lohia 1994, where we
                        also find back-translations that are not attested in any Sanskrit source. I have consulted both
                        Chandra 1999 and Lohia 1994, and neither source contains any information on the Sanskrit names
                        for these thus-gone ones’ buddhafields. In some cases there are relatively obvious options for
                        the back-translation of a given buddhafield, and in others the options are too varied to present
                        a clear and preferable Sanskrit equivalent.</note>

                    might. The Buddha then assures Ānanda, and by extension anyone who might read this sūtra, that it is
                    impossible for anyone who has heard the name Bhaiṣajya­guru­vaiḍūrya­prabha to be reborn in the lower

                    offerings to Bhaiṣajya­guru­vaiḍūrya­prabha can interrupt the death process and call a dying person’s
                    consciousness back to their body. Trāṇamukta outlines a ritual that is performed over a
                    forty-nine-day period that begins with observing the eightfold purification vows, providing support
                    for the offering rite to the monastic saṅgha, and contemplating Bhaiṣajyaguru’s name three times
                    each day and three times each night. Then, presumably, the monastic saṅgha members that one has
                    supplied with provisions for the offering rite recite the text forty-nine times and offer oil lamps
                    to seven statues of Bhaiṣajyaguru for a forty-nine-day period. Trāṇamukta notes that kings can also
                    perform this rite to avert disaster and ensure the happiness of the kingdom. He concludes his
                    instructions with a brief enumeration of nine types of untimely death, assuring Ānanda that the
                    problem of untimely death is precisely the reason that Śākyamuni has taught the use of mantras and
                    medicines. This part of the text concludes with the vow of the twelve great yakṣa generals, who make a commitment to protect anyone
                    who bears the name of Bhaiṣajyaguru or supports his worship. The vow of the twelve yakṣa generals marks the end of the portion of this text

                    world, could really allow beings to develop such good qualities. In response to their skepticism,
                    Śākyamuni enters into a state of absorption that summons the seven thus-gone ones before the
                    assembly. Amazed, the gods make offerings to the seven thus-gone ones and set forth their aspiration
                    that all beings might attain this absorption and be able to actually see them, just as they have.
                    Mañjuśrī then asks the seven thus-gone ones to teach a dhāraṇī that can overcome illnesses and
                    protect beings from those with ill intentions, planetary influences, lunar asterisms, death,
                    enemies, and wild animals, and that can fulfill all beings’ wishes. The seven thus-gone ones recite
                    their dhāraṇī and provide a description of the recitation ritual and the benefits of performing it.
                    This is followed by a dhāraṇī given by Vajrapāṇi, Śakra, and the Four Great Kings, as well as

                <p tid="210">The exact relationship between Toh 503 and Toh 504 remains unclear. In his brief study of traditions associated with Bhaiṣajyaguru,
                    Leonard Zwilling argues that Toh 504 was enlarged into Toh 503, stating that the vows of the other
                    six thus-gone ones “by and large, duplicate those of Bhaiṣajyaguru, and their Buddha-fields are
                    merely named [and] lack any sufficiently distinctive individuating characteristics.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-087-008-303"> Zwilling 1980, 417. Zwilling also argues that <title xml:lang="en">The Detailed Account of the Previous Aspirations of the Seven Thus-Gone
                            Ones</title> represents a “tantrification” of the Bhaiṣajyaguru cult by arguing that the
                        “appending” of a series of dhāraṇīs to the core
                        text (the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhaiṣajya­guru­sūtra</title>) was likely a later development
                        that reflected the incursion of tantric ritual techniques into a Mahāyāna text. This claim is
                        dubious, as the use of dhāraṇīs, though
                        indicative of the emergence of an esoteric Buddhist ritual culture, is wholly appropriate to
                        Mahāyāna Buddhism. </note> As readers can see for themselves in this translation, this does not
                    seem to be the case, at least with respect to the Tibetan translation of the text. The aspirations
                    of each of the seven thus-gone ones differ in both number and content, the descriptions of each of
                    the buddhafields contain notable differences, and none of the aspirations and buddhafields of the
                    six buddhas that precede Bhaiṣajya­guru­vaiḍūrya­prabha appear to duplicate his aspirations and the
                    description of his buddhafield. In addition, the role of hearing and reciting the names of these
                    buddhas receives far greater emphasis in the aspirations of the first six buddhas than it does in
                    the account of Bhaiṣajyaguru’s twelve aspirations. Judging from the syntax, word choices, and
                    organization of the presentation of Bhaiṣajyaguru’s aspirations, it is quite possible that Toh 504
                    was an independent text that was at some point incorporated into Toh 503. However, analyzing the
                    first section of the text using these same criteria also suggests the possibility that the
                    aspirations of the first six buddhas in Toh 503 represent a compilation of several independent texts
                    containing bodhisattva “aspirations.” The text itself hints at its own eclectic origins in its
                    conclusion, where Śākyamuni provides four separate titles for the work that each refer to separate
                    sections of the text. </p>

                            <!--<term type="definition">Cognate with the English term <distinct>divine</distinct>. The <term type="ignore">devas</term> are most generically a class of divine, celestial beings who populate the narratives of Indian mythology. <term type="ignore">Devas</term> make regular appearances in Buddhist literature at the head of the assemblies of celestial and supernatural beings who attend the teachings, interact with the Buddha, bodhisattvas and other spiritual figures, and celebrate the delivery of their sermons. In Buddhist cosmology, the <term type="ignore">devas</term> are subdivided into numerous classes based on the specific <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">devalokas</foreign>, the “heavens” in which they reside. Traditionally there are between twenty-six and twenty-eight devalokas, divided between the desire realm (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāmadhātu</foreign>), form or material realm (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">rūpadhātu</foreign>), and formless or immaterial realm (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">arūpyadhātu</foreign>). The state of <term type="ignore">deva</term> is reached either through meritorious acts or the cultivation of subtle meditative states, and is therefore considered a higher mode of rebirth in comparison to rebirth among hell beings, pretas, and animals. Nonetheless, all the devalokas are within the three realms of saṃsāra and therefore transitory. Thus while the <term type="ignore">devas</term> occupy the highest strata within the scheme of the five or six “destinies” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gati</foreign>), the realms within saṃsāra where beings take rebirth, their state is still one determined by the fetters (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saṃyojana</foreign>) that bind one to the perpetual cycle of rebirth. Also rendered here as “<term type="ignore">gods</term>.”</term>AR: replaced by standard definition -->

                                to the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratimokṣa</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bodhicitta</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mantra</foreign> vows, and this schema was perhaps most famously
                                promoted in Tibet by the thirteenth-century Tibetan polymath Sakya Paṇḍita. The second
                                set, which is likely the set of <term type="ignore">three vows</term> referred to here, consists of 1) the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratimokṣa</foreign> vows (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">so thar gyi sdom pa</foreign>) of the desire realm; 2)
