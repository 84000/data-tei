                    and reveal how these ten bodhisattvas can purify their karmic obscurations.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">Not Forsaking the Buddha</title> takes place at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha, where the
                        Buddha is accompanied by a large community of monks and numerous bodhisattvas. Ten of these bodhisattvas have recently turned
                        away from the teaching because they have failed to make progress despite exerting themselves for seven years. However, a
                        devoted bodhisattva called Undaunted requests the Buddha to give these ten bodhisattvas an instruction that will enable them
                        to generate insight and wisdom. In response, the Buddha relates the past events that caused these bodhisattvas’ inability to
                        make spiritual progress: in a distant past, in another world, these ten bodhisattvas had wrongly accused another Dharma
                        teacher of having flawed discipline. As a result of this negative act, for many lifetimes afterward they were reborn in the
                        lower realms. Only after suffering in the lower realms for a long time had they purified enough of their former negative
                        action to once again attain human rebirth and go forth as monks. Still, due to the lingering obscuration created by their
                        former negative act, they were unable to attain any results of their practice for seven hundred lifetimes. Now, however, the
                        Buddha explains that if they chant a certain dhāraṇī and train for one week by recalling the qualities of the buddhas, their
                        remaining obscurations will be purified. The bodhisattvas practice accordingly and are finally able to make progress on the
                        path. Following this instruction, the Buddha completes the discourse by explaining several other bodhisattva trainings that
                        further support spiritual progress and secure the welfare of beings. </p>

                    <p tid="69">The potential obstacles and pitfalls that practitioners of all levels may encounter on their path 
                        are mentioned in many sūtras, particularly in the context of future degenerate times when the Dharma is in the process 
                        of decline. Not many canonical texts, however, focus primarily on bodhisattvas who have become disheartened, as this one does. 
                        Again, while many sūtras speak of the attainment of a stage of realization after which progress toward awakening becomes
                        irreversible, there are few concrete examples of what kinds of reversal bodhisattvas may face before they reach such an elevated
                    stage. The bodhisattvas described here provide such an example, although the fact that surprisingly they are described 
                    nevertheless as “bodhisattva great beings” suggests that this term is not necessarily correlated with irreversibility. 
                    This text is particularly valuable, too, for the details it prescribes for remedying and overcoming such reversals. In 
                    these respects it has some similarities with one of the few other sūtras on a similar theme, <title xml:lang="en">Inspiring

                    <p tid="70">To our knowledge, no Sanskrit version of this sūtra exists. In addition to the Tibetan translation the sūtra was
                        translated twice into Chinese. The first of these translations (Taishō 811) was produced sometime near the end of the third
                        century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> by the Indo-Scythian monk Dharmarakṣa (ca. 233–310 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>). With
                        this Chinese translation, we thus have a <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">terminus ante quem</foreign> for the composition
                        of this sūtra, which places it relatively early in the formative period of the literature of the Great Vehicle in India. The
                        second Chinese translation (Taishō 831) was produced in the early sixth century (ca. 508–35 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>) by
                        the prolific Indian translator Bodhiruci.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-068-010-5"> Taishō 811 is <title xml:lang="zh">佛說決定總持經</title> (<title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Foshuo jueding zong chi jing</title>); Taishō 831 is <title xml:lang="zh">謗佛經</title> (<title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Bang fojing</title>).</note>

                        dhāraṇī; and thus, feeling discouraged, they had offered back their precepts and lapsed. All of them, having thus assented to

                        not? Because bodhisattvas do not take rebirth under the sway of afflictions; rather, bodhisattvas take rebirth through the

                            <term type="definition">This term has several meanings. Often it refers to a ritual incantation that usually encapsulates
                                the meaning of a longer text. In this sense it is considered to assist in the retention of the text and imbue the one
                                who recites it with a variety of desired powers. At other times this term carries the meaning of “holding” or
                                “retaining,” and so it is frequently used in reference to memory and learning. In the context of this text, the term
                                carries both of these meanings. Finally, this term can also be applied as a classificatory term to Buddhist scriptures
                                that contain one or more such incantations.</term>
