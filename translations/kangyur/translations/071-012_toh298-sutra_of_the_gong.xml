                    <p tid="7">The gaṇḍī, sometimes misleadingly translated into English as “gong,” refers
                        to a wooden beam cut from specific trees to particular proportions. From as
                        early as the first century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> down to the present
                        day, it has been widely used in Buddhist monasteries as an instrument for
                        summoning monks to assembly.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-071-012-7">As noted by ethnomusicologist
                            Mireille Helffer, “The oldest writings on Indian Buddhism mention an
                            instrument, the gandi, used to call monks to assembly. Recent
                            observations show an instrument called gandi, or ganti, used similarly
                            in Tibetan monasteries. Other recent texts confirm that the old gandi,
                            like the modern version, is a phonoxyle; its shape is similar to that of
                            certain wooden semanterions used in Greek Orthodox monasteries. The
                            prescriptions of the canonical writings are still followed, and the
                            Tibetan Buddhists, faithful to a tradition received from India, continue
                            to build and use the gandi.” Helffer (1983), p. 112.</note> To hear
                        its sound is said to quell all disruptive thoughts, dispel obstacles, and
                        pacify all conflicts and negative forces. The role of the gaṇḍī in Buddhist
                        monastic life appears to have been quite varied, extending to both
                        nontantric and tantric forms of ritualism and daily life. As an example of
                        its diverse functions in the day-to-day monastic itinerary, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> classifies five different types or
                        uses of the gaṇḍī: the gaṇḍī for assembling monks, the gaṇḍī for meetings,
                        the gaṇḍī for death ceremonies, the gaṇḍī for renunciation, and the gaṇḍī
                        for emergencies.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-071-012-8"> This classification is given in the
                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Poṣadhavastu</title>,<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh1-2.html"/> which comprises the
                            second chapter of the Tibetan version of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> included in the Kangyur and corresponds to the
                            Khandhaka section of the Theravāda Vinaya in Pāli. For a translation of
                            this passage as it occurs in the Sanskrit Gilgit manuscript purported to
                            belong to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, see Hu-von Hinüber (1991), p.
                            746. The passage appears to distinguish five different kinds of gaṇḍī
                            but more likely specifies five different ways in which the gaṇḍī is used
                            in monastic life. Indeed, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Poṣadhavastu</title> elsewhere specifies the different ways of
                            striking the gaṇḍī beam in each of these five contexts. For details on
                            these contexts as well as traditional classifications of its use in
                            tantric practice, see Sobkovyak (2015), 690–93.</note>

                        a thousand monks and a great gathering of bodhisattvas. They were all worthy
                        ones. Their contaminations were exhausted, their duties fulfilled, their work
                        concluded, their burdens put down, their personal welfare attained, their
                        bonds to existence destroyed, and their minds fully liberated through

                        addressed him with these words: “Bhagavān, in the future, during times of
                        conflict, all beings will have evil minds, quarrelsome minds filled with
                        desire, hatred, and delusion. While intensely coveting others’ possessions
                        and striving to devour one another, they will cause the previous period when
                        teachings were given by the Bhagavān to decline. They will cause the
                        abandonment of the true Dharma. They will go against the Buddha, the Dharma,
                        and those who are free of desire. Please teach a way to eliminate such

                                the Buddha, he is presented as sheltered by a seven-headed nāga,
                                which refers to the nāga that sheltered him from the storm shortly
                                before his awakening. Perhaps the mention of seven nāgas in this

                                Jaṭilas, Ājīvikas, and Cārvākas. Initially, the
                                term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tīrthika</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tīrthya</foreign> may
                                have referred to non-brahmanic ascetic orders. Tīrthika (“forder”)
                                literally translates as “one belonging to or associated with
                                (possessive suffix <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">–ika</foreign>) stairs
                                for landing or for descent into a river,” or “a bathing place,” or
                                “a place of pilgrimage on the banks of sacred streams”
                                (Monier-Williams). The term may have originally referred to temple
                                priests at river crossings or fords where travelers propitiated a
                                deity before crossing. The Sanskrit term seems to have undergone
                                metonymic transfer in referring to those able to ford the turbulent
                                river of saṃsāra (as in the Jain tīrthaṅkaras, “ford makers”), and
                                it came to be used in Buddhist sources to refer to teachers of rival
                                religious traditions. The Sanskrit term is closely rendered by the
