                            Radiance</title> presents the
                        remarkable account of an abandoned child who is discovered calmly sitting
                        alone in a derelict dwelling in the town of Śrāvastī, licked and nuzzled by
                        wild animals while the townsfolk gawk. The Buddha Śākyamuni, who is in residence
                        nearby, sends Ānanda to investigate, although he knows that the child is an
                        incarnation of a great bodhisattva whose remaining karmic obscurations are
                        now on the verge of exhaustion. The Buddha’s action triggers a chain of
                        events that completes this purification and launches the bodhisattva to the
                        next great stage of his spiritual path. This is therefore a story of the
                        bodhisattva’s spiritual journey that spans countless eons.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-048-003-4"/>
                    <p tid="7">This sūtra also serves as a framework for various types of Dharma
                        instruction. When he first meets the child, the Buddha’s blessings, coupled
                        with the child’s own merit and wisdom gathered in previous lifetimes, spur a
                        polemical dialogue in metered verse in which the child challenges the Buddha
                        to reconcile his realization of emptiness with his compassionate teaching
                        activity. The child adopts a nihilistic viewpoint as a rhetorical strategy
                        for eliciting an explanation from the Buddha of the relation between
                        ultimate and relative truth. The Buddha responds that it is the buddhas’
                        realization of how things truly are, which produces spontaneous and
                        nonconceptual compassionate activity for others because the buddhas respond
                        to the suffering of sentient beings’ confused misapprehension of how things
                        truly are. A buddha knows that appearances are not real, while sentient
                        beings do not. A sentient being’s perception of appearances is compared to
                        clouds in the sky and characterized as imaginary imputation, since the
                        luminous, profound stillness that is mind’s true nature is not realized.
                        This exchange is therefore a pithy elucidation of the core principles of the
                        Mahāyāna Buddhist teachings: the view of emptiness suffused with compassion
                        that inspires one to produce boundless teaching activity that in turn
                        instills that same view in others.</p>

                    <p tid="8">Shortly after this exchange Śakra appears, drawn by lights that radiate from
                        the child’s body throughout the universe, and offers the child a set of
                        divine clothes to cover his naked body. A sermon from the child follows, in
                        which he explains to Śakra all the fine qualities that adorn bodhisattvas
                        such that no further superficial covering of their physical forms is
                        required. With this show of miracles and moving sermon, the child is
                        proclaimed by all present to be an advanced bodhisattva who is inconceivably
                        radiant, and he is so named with great rejoicing.</p>

                    <p tid="9">The next episode in this account takes place in the home of the child’s
                        mother, where the Buddha has escorted him. At first the child’s mother is
                        ashamed to face the Buddha, but the child respectfully urges his mother to
                        make offerings to the Buddha and generate the resolve for awakening before
                        him, and she proceeds to do so. This act on both their parts completely
                        purifies the residual negative karma they shared.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-048-003-7"/>
                    <p tid="10">King Prasenajit of the state of Kośala, one of the Buddha’s principal
                        sponsors, then comes to visit him at his monastic compound outside of town,
                        having heard of the child’s miraculous feats. Upon first seeing the child,
                        the king wonders what kinds of deeds he must have performed in the past to
                        have such a perfect physical form. Inconceivable Radiance, through the power
                        of the Buddha and his own past roots of virtue, knows clairvoyantly what
                        King Prasenajit has realized about him, which prompts him to teach the king
                        about how pure actions result in a pure physical form. The king then asks
                        the Buddha to explain how the child, with obvious great virtues and merit,
                        could end up in the unfortunate situation of being abandoned by his unwed
                        mother. The Buddha responds by telling the story of a previous life, long
                        ago, when this bodhisattva (then named Earth) insulted and cursed his mentor
                        in retaliation for being chastised for weakness in his practice, and how the
                        very words of this curse continued to ripen for Earth in lifetime after
                        lifetime, until this very life. Throughout his many lifetimes of being
                        orphaned, abandoned, and eaten by wild predators, the bodhisattva Earth
                        nonetheless never renounced the awakening mind, until finally his positive
                        merit led him to the auspicious circumstances that unfold, with the Buddha’s
                        guidance, in this account. </p>

                    <p tid="11">In response, the king demonstrates his understanding to the Buddha by
                        offering his own homily about how one should serve a spiritual master and
                        lead a virtuous life, and the benefits that will ensue. The Buddha confirms
                        that the king has spoken truthfully, meaning that the king has spoken Dharma
                        with his blessing.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-048-003-9"/>
                    <p tid="12">Finally, prompted by the child Inconceivable Radiance, the Buddha presents
                        his own teaching on five sets of four <distinct>dharmas</distinct> (here
                        meaning spiritual qualities, practices, or realizations) that bodhisattvas
                        must possess in order to awaken to buddhahood by virtue of gaining
                        acceptance of even the most profound Dharmas. In other words, bodhisattvas
                        should practice the ability to face the profound truth of emptiness without
                        fear, the third and most difficult component of the transcendent virtue of
                        acceptance within the schema of six or ten transcendent virtues.
                    </p>

                    <p tid="13">At the conclusion of this teaching, Ānanda kneels down, joins his palms
                        together, and, singing a hymn of praise to the Buddha, requests an
                        explanation of this auspicious encounter with the child Inconceivable
                        Radiance. The Buddha then prophesies the child’s eventual full awakening as
                        the buddha bhagavān Inconceivable Radiance
                        at the end of a future dark age in which no other buddha has ever appeared.
