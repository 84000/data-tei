                    Inconceivable Radiance is revealed through a dialogue with the Buddha Śākyamuni.
                    The Buddha furthermore recounts events from the child’s past lives to illustrate
                    how actions committed in one life will determine one’s future circumstances. The
                    teaching concludes with the Buddha prophesying how the child Inconceivable
                    Radiance will eventually fully awaken in the future.</p>

                            Radiance</title> presents the remarkable account of an abandoned child
                        who is discovered calmly sitting alone in a derelict dwelling in the town of
                        Śrāvastī, licked and nuzzled by wild animals while the townsfolk gawk. The
                        Buddha Śākyamuni, who is in residence nearby, sends Ānanda to investigate,
                        although he knows that the child is an incarnation of a great bodhisattva
                        whose remaining karmic obscurations are now on the verge of exhaustion. The
                        Buddha’s action triggers a chain of events that completes this purification
                        and launches the bodhisattva to the next great stage of his spiritual path.
                        This is therefore a story of the bodhisattva’s spiritual journey that spans
                        countless eons.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-048-003-4"/>
                    <p tid="7">This sūtra also serves as a framework for various types of Dharma
                        instruction. When he first meets the child, the Buddha’s blessings, coupled
                        with the child’s own merit and wisdom gathered in previous lifetimes, spur a
                        polemical dialogue in metered verse in which the child challenges the Buddha
                        to reconcile his realization of emptiness with his compassionate teaching
                        activity. The child adopts a nihilistic viewpoint as a rhetorical strategy
                        for eliciting an explanation from the Buddha of the relation between
                        ultimate and relative truth. The Buddha responds that it is the buddhas’
                        realization of how things truly are, which produces spontaneous and
                        nonconceptual compassionate activity for others because the buddhas respond
                        to the suffering of sentient beings’ confused misapprehension of how things
                        truly are. A buddha knows that appearances are not real, while sentient
                        beings do not. A sentient being’s perception of appearances is compared to
                        clouds in the sky and characterized as imaginary imputation, since the
                        luminous, profound stillness that is mind’s true nature is not realized.
                        This exchange is therefore a pithy elucidation of the core principles of the
                        Mahāyāna Buddhist teachings: the view of emptiness suffused with compassion
                        that inspires one to produce boundless teaching activity that in turn
                        instills that same view in others.</p>

                    <p tid="8">Shortly after this exchange Śakra appears, drawn by lights that
                        radiate from the child’s body throughout the universe, and offers the child
                        a set of divine clothes to cover his naked body. A sermon from the child
                        follows, in which he explains to Śakra all the fine qualities that adorn
                        bodhisattvas such that no further superficial covering of their physical
                        forms is required. With this show of miracles and moving sermon, the child
                        is proclaimed by all present to be an advanced bodhisattva who is
                        inconceivably radiant, and he is so named with great rejoicing.</p>

                        child’s mother, where the Buddha has escorted him. At first the child’s
                        mother is ashamed to face the Buddha, but the child respectfully urges his
                        mother to make offerings to the Buddha and generate the resolve for
                        awakening before him, and she proceeds to do so. This act on both their
                        parts completely purifies the residual negative karma they shared.</p>

                    <p tid="10">King Prasenajit of the state of Kośala, one of the Buddha’s
                        principal sponsors, then comes to visit him at his monastic compound outside
                        of town, having heard of the child’s miraculous feats. Upon first seeing the
                        child, the king wonders what kinds of deeds he must have performed in the
                        past to have such a perfect physical form. Inconceivable Radiance, through
                        the power of the Buddha and his own past roots of virtue, knows
                        clairvoyantly what King Prasenajit has realized about him, which prompts him
                        to teach the king about how pure actions result in a pure physical form. The
                        king then asks the Buddha to explain how the child, with obvious great
                        virtues and merit, could end up in the unfortunate situation of being
                        abandoned by his unwed mother. The Buddha responds by telling the story of a
                        previous life, long ago, when this bodhisattva (then named Earth) insulted
                        and cursed his mentor in retaliation for being chastised for weakness in his
                        practice, and how the very words of this curse continued to ripen for Earth
                        in lifetime after lifetime, until this very life. Throughout his many
                        lifetimes of being orphaned, abandoned, and eaten by wild predators, the
                        bodhisattva Earth nonetheless never renounced the awakening mind, until
                        finally his positive merit led him to the auspicious circumstances that
                        unfold, with the Buddha’s guidance, in this account. </p>

                        lead a virtuous life, and the benefits that will ensue. The Buddha confirms
                        that the king has spoken truthfully, meaning that the king has spoken Dharma
                        with his blessing.</p>

                        in which no other buddha has ever appeared. The Buddha’s final counsel is
