                    events from a past life of the bodhisattva Maitreya in which he was born as a king and for the first
                    time gave rise to the mind set on awakening. Later, the Buddha recounts another past life of
                    Maitreya—this time as a monk—and explains why he is known today as the bodhisattva Maitreya. These
                    two narratives are interspersed with a series of Dharma teachings emphasizing the unborn nature of
                    phenomena and the need to develop the view that transcends all reference points.</p>

                        where the Buddha is residing with many monks and bodhisattvas. When Maitreya requests the Buddha
                        to answer some questions, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī interposes himself, telling Maitreya that the
                        Buddha will only speak if Maitreya can present his inquiries in a nonconceptual manner. When
                        Maitreya confirms that he would never present his inquiries in any other way, the Buddha
                        proceeds to teach. </p>

                    <p tid="9">The Buddha Śākyamuni first narrates in great detail the story of a past king, known as
                        Golden Color, who worshiped the Buddha Pure Golden Light for millions of years. At the end of
                        this period, through the skillful teaching of Pure Golden Light, the king gave rise to the mind
                        of awakening, renounced his household, and became a monastic. At this point in the story, the
                        Buddha dramatically reveals that King Golden Color was in fact a previous incarnation of the
                        bodhisattva Maitreya and that all members of the present assembly at Śrāvastī were also present
                        in the retinue at that time. Interestingly, the Buddha mentions here that he himself initially
                        gave rise to the mind set on awakening eighty-four thousand eons after Maitreya did so.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-16"> Note that the explanation of why the Buddha gained
                            awakening faster than Maitreya, although he had originally given rise to the mind set on
                            awakening only after Maitreya had done so, differ from what is recounted in <title xml:lang="en">The Question of Maitreya </title>(Toh 85).</note>

                    <p tid="10">Next, the Buddha recounts the story of a monk, Dṛḍamati, who lived long ago during the
                        time of the Buddha Ratnacchātra. Absorbed within the meditation of loving kindness, the monk
                        Dṛḍamati could lead beings into that absorption by simply passing by their homes. Amazed by such
                        miraculous displays, all the gods proclaimed in unison that this monk should be called Maitreya
                        (The Loving One). Accordingly, the Buddha Ratnacchātra prophesied that henceforth the monk
                        Dṛḍamati would be known as the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, even after reaching awakening.
                        The sūtra then comes to a close as everyone rejoices in the words of the Blessed One. </p>

                        being the same, then one is imputing something that does not exist. Thus one might think, ‘This
                        is the Buddha,’ ‘This is the Dharma,’ ‘This is the Saṅgha,’ ‘This is the self,’ ‘This is a
                        sentient being,’ ‘This is a person,’ ‘This is a child of a man,’ ‘This is a human being,’ ‘This
                        is a doer,’ ‘This is an experiencer,’ ‘This is interrupted,’ ‘This is permanent,’ ‘This is an
                        ordinary being,’ ‘This is a hearer,’ ‘This is a solitary buddha,’ ‘This is a bodhisattva,’ ‘This
                        is a wrongdoer,’ ‘This is someone free from wrongdoing,’ ‘This is defiled,’ ‘This is undefiled,’
                        ‘This is conditioned,’ ‘This is unconditioned,’ ‘This is thorough affliction,’ ‘This is complete
                        purification,’ ‘This is virtue,’ ‘This is nonvirtue,’ ‘This is mundane,’ ‘This is supramundane,’
                        ‘This is saṃsāra,’ ‘This is nirvāṇa,’ ‘This is an entity,’ ‘This is a nonentity,’ ‘This is
                        existent,’ ‘This is nonexistent,’ ‘This is attainment,’ ‘This is manifest realization,’ ‘This is
                        actualization,’ ‘This is the path,’ or ‘This is the fruition of the path.’ All these are
                        imputations. Why is it so? Because, Venerable Śāriputra, sameness is beyond thought. Those who
                        think in terms of such concepts are imputing in terms of sameness. They are not imputing in
                        terms of lack of sameness. Those who see sameness without seeing anything are seeing sameness,
                        but those who create imputations perceive things as not sameness. Those who do not reify
                        sameness perceive sameness, but those who impute do not.”</p>

                        nature, their minds do not fixate on any of them. On the other hand, so that sentient beings who
                        are possessed of errors and adhere to concepts may be freed from their errors and focal points,
                        those bodhisattvas teach them the Dharma—explaining that all phenomena are devoid of essential
                        nature and leading them to the realization that all phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature. You
                        should understand that bodhisattvas are skilled in means and that they apply and train in the
                        individual gateways of the bodhisattvas.</p>

                        awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. Those bodhisattvas will give away all their
                        possessions without needing to give away their heads, legs and arms, eyes, limbs, flesh, blood,
                        bones, marrow, fat, complexions, skin, or entire bodies. Through the blissful vehicle, they will
                        awaken to unsurpassed and prefect buddhahood. What are these four qualities? Great king, the
                        first is a bodhisattva’s firm commitment to pursue virtuous qualities. That bodhisattva firmly
                        engages in the activity of generating roots of virtue, never feels disheartened, and is strongly
                        rooted in the path of the Great Vehicle. Great king, the second quality is the complete purity
                        of a bodhisattva’s discipline. Such a bodhisattva is praised by the noble and the wise ones, is
                        embraced by unsurpassed and perfect awakening, and experiences the joy of Dharma through the
                        awareness of observing pure discipline. Great king, the third quality concerns a bodhisattva who
                        observes loving kindness, who focuses on concentration but remains absorbed in baseless
                        concentration. Great king, there is no other form of bliss that compares to the bliss
                        experienced by a bodhisattva who does not fixate on anything while remaining in absorption and
                        who has developed an attitude of equanimity toward all sentient beings. Great king, the fourth
                        quality is a bodhisattva’s genuine understanding of the Dharma. That bodhisattva understands
                        phenomena as they really are, thinking, <ref cRef="F.289.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-289"/> “All these karmic formations are empty. They
                        are devoid of a self, a sentient being, a life force, someone giving, the act of giving, and
                        someone taking, someone being patient, the situation toward which one is patient, and the object
                        of that patience, someone practicing diligence and the aim of that diligence, someone training
                        in concentration and the object of that training, and someone meditating and the object of that
                        meditation.” When bodhisattvas understand phenomena genuinely in that way, they see that all
                        conditioned phenomena are empty of intrinsic nature. Then, without holding on to any reference
                        points, they remain within the experience of bliss. Great king, a bodhisattva great being who
                        possesses those four Dharma qualities will experience all forms of bliss and swiftly awaken to

                        his merchant caste to become a monastic under the teachings of the thus-gone, worthy, perfect
                        Buddha Ratnacchātra. Noble son, at the time of the Thus-Gone One Ratnacchātra’s doctrine, when
                        the monk Dṛḍamati went begging for alms, there were in this world eighty-four thousand villages,
                        eighty-four thousand cities, eighty-four thousand towns, eighty-four thousand countries, and
                        eighty-four thousand marketplaces. The monk Dṛḍamati wandered around in all those villages,
                        cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces to beg for alms. During his wanderings, he promised
                        himself, ‘I will not eat any food until I establish a total of one hundred beings in the five
                        fundamental precepts.’ Noble son, with such a commitment, the monk Dṛḍamati wandered around in
                        those villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces to beg for alms, and he never ate any
                        food before he had established a total of one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts.
                        Noble son, on some occasions it took him one day to establish one hundred beings in the five
                        fundamental precepts. On other occasions it took him two days. <ref cRef="F.293.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-061-018-297"/> In the latter case, he
                        would fast until the third day, when he would then eat again. Sometimes it took him three days
                        to establish one hundred beings in the five fundamental precepts. Noble son, sometimes it took
                        him four, five, six, or seven days. Even if he had to fast for seven full days, he never lost
                        courage due to his compassion for sentient beings. He would simply eat food on the eighth day.
                        Noble son, for eighty-four thousand years the monk Dṛḍamati followed this principle and wandered
                        in those big towns, villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces, establishing sentient
                        beings in the five fundamental precepts without ever loosing courage. Noble son, when those
                        eighty-four thousand years had passed, the monk Dṛḍamati had established thirty-six quintillion
                        men, women, boys, and girls in the five fundamental precepts.</p>

                        perfect awakening.’ For forty-two thousand years, he proclaimed in front of them the praises of
                        the Buddha, the Dharma, the Saṅgha, and the Great Vehicle. Among those sentient beings who had
                        been established in the five fundamental precepts, there were three hundred million who had

                        unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The rest of them were inspired by the inferior approach, and
                        by the power of such conditions they gave rise to the mind set on the solitary buddhas’

                        can observe conscientiousness.’ Noble son, for twenty-one thousand years, the monk Dṛḍamati
                        conferred transmissions on how to remain in absorption to all thirty-six quintillion beings.
                        Noble son, the monk Dṛḍamati gave them oral instructions to make sure they would all practice
                        the absorption on loving kindness. Noble son, when the monk Dṛḍamati went to a town, he would
                        enter absorption on loving kindness. Within that absorption, he would go for alms in the
                        villages, cities, towns, countries, and marketplaces. The very moment he stepped onto a
                        threshold, those beings observing loving kindness would enter absorption on loving kindness.
                        Noble son, this was due to the special qualities of an extraordinary resolve, trust in the roots
                        of virtue, and interest in emptiness. Therefore, whenever the monk Dṛḍamati placed his feet on
                        the steps of an entrance, those sentient beings entered the absorption on loving kindness, just

                                <term type="definition">A frequently used synonym for buddha. According to different explanations, it can be read as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathā-gata</foreign>, literally meaning “one who has thus gone,” or as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathā-agata</foreign>, “one who has thus come.” <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Gata</foreign>, though literally meaning “gone,” is a past passive participle used to describe a state or condition of existence. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tatha­(tā)</foreign>, often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness,” is the quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways, but in general it implies one who has departed in the wake of the buddhas of the past, or one who has manifested the supreme enlightenment dependent on the reality that does not abide in the two extremes of existence and quiescence.</term>

                                <term type="definition">In Buddhist literature, an epithet applied to buddhas, most often to Śākyamuni. The Sanskrit term generically means “possessing fortune,” but in specifically Buddhist contexts implies that a buddha is in possession of six auspicious qualities (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhaga</foreign>) associated with complete awakening. The Tibetan term—where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bcom</foreign> is said to refer to “subduing” the four māras, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ldan</foreign> to “possessing” the great qualities of buddhahood, and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">’das</foreign> to “going beyond” saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavat</foreign> is interpreted, in addition, as “one who destroys the four māras.” This is achieved either by reading <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagavat</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhagnavat</foreign> (“one who broke”), or by tracing the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">bhaga</foreign> to the root <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">√bhañj</foreign>, “to break.”</term>
