                        <title xml:lang="en">Arousing Determination</title> appears in the Heap of Jewels (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ratnakūṭa</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">dkon brtsegs</foreign>) section of the Kangyur. The sūtra opens with the
                        bodhisattva Maitreya observing a group of sixty bodhisattvas among the five hundred who have
                        gathered around the Buddha in the Deer Park on the outskirts of Vārāṇasī. These sixty
                        bodhisattvas have strayed from the bodhisattva path. Rather than studying and practicing in
                        solitude, they have become distracted by worldly concerns and have stopped applying themselves
                        to the Dharma. Seeking to help them restore their commitments, Maitreya invites them to approach
                        the Buddha, confess their faults, and request his guidance. The bodhisattvas then reveal and
                        confess to the Buddha their failings and doubts about their capacity to meet the bodhisattva
                        ideal.</p>

                    <p tid="11">The Buddha explains the causes and conditions they created in a former lifetime that have led to
                        their current predicament. Specifically, during the previous period of the Buddha Krakucchanda,
                        these bodhisattvas denigrated and slandered two monks, creating schisms and doubts in the Saṅgha
                        and the wider community. Many lifetimes of painful ripening of this negative karma ensued. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-8"/>
                    <p tid="12">The Buddha further prophesies, however, that although the bodhisattvas’ negative karma will
                        continue to ripen in subsequent lives, once it is finally exhausted, during a period in which
                        the Dharma is declining, they will attain rebirth in the realm of the Buddha Amitābha. Hearing
                        this, the bodhisattvas are newly inspired and resolve not to repeat their mistakes. Maitreya
                        asks the Buddha whether they will abide by their renewed commitment, and he confirms that they
                        will. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-9"/>
                    <p tid="13">This is followed by a lengthy series of enumerations by the Buddha, in response to inquiries by
                        Maitreya, concerning the negative consequences of each fault of conduct in which the sixty
                        bodhisattvas had engaged, as well as the advantages of refraining from each one. In several
                        instances, these lists are presented first in prose form and then repeated in verse as an
                            <foreign xml:lang="Input Language" type="term">aide-memoire</foreign>. Maitreya’s questions
                        also prompt the Buddha to caution about the future degeneration of the Dharma, when it will be
                        corrupted by the materialistic interests of teachers. He describes the pitfalls of teaching the
                        Dharma without ridding oneself of attachment to personal gain and respect. </p>

                    <p tid="14">The Buddha’s countervailing instruction is to beware of judging the veracity or quality of the
                        Dharma by referencing the perceived motivation or character of the one teaching it. Śāntideva
                        emphasizes this point in his <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign>
                        &lt;Reference Toh 3940&gt;, citing this sūtra at length<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-11"> See <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign> folio 59.a, quoting <title xml:lang="en">Arousing Determination</title> at folio 133.b and the same at folio

                        judging the conduct of fellow practitioners of the Bodhisattva Vehicle; instead, one must focus
                        on detecting and correcting one’s own faults. The Buddha later advises Maitreya that what marks
                        someone as a follower of his teachings, and as an ordained member of his community, is not the
                        formality of vows or the semblance of piety, but rather the cultivation of the qualities of the
                        path, including renunciation, concentration, restrained speech, and the pursuit of wisdom.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-12"> This section of the sūtra is also quoted extensively in <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign>, starting at folio 272.b.</note>

                    <p tid="15">An important corollary teaching imparted by the Buddha in this sūtra is how to determine whether
                        or not a teaching qualifies as authentic Dharma. His rule, also quoted and discussed by
                        Śāntideva, is that everything that is well-spoken, no matter what it is, or by whom it is
                        offered, is what the Buddha has spoken.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-043-006-14"> See <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">Śikṣāsamuccaya</foreign> folio 11.b. See also Wedemeyer 2007, 411 and n. 45
                            (referencing Śāntideva’s quotation of this passage from this sūtra) and Snellgrove 1958,
                            620–23 (referencing the same passage from Śāntideva).</note> And what qualifies an
                        instruction as well-spoken is whether or not it is meaningful, consistent with the Dharma,
                        designed to reduce mental defilements, and a teaching of the qualities of nirvāṇa as opposed to
                        saṃsāra. This sūtra appears to be the <foreign xml:lang="Input Language" type="term">locus

                    <p tid="16">The sūtra concludes on a positive note, in which the Buddha outlines the ten positive attitudes
                        that lead to rebirth in the realm of the Buddha Amitāyus, which is another name for the Buddha
                        Amitābha. This serves as a valediction to his earlier prophecy about the future awakening in
                        Amitāyus’s realm of the group of bodhisattvas who had approached him to confess their wayward
                        conduct and vowed not to repeat their mistakes of attitude and conduct. In this way, <title xml:lang="en">Arousing Determination</title> fulfills its intention and serves as a set of
                        guidelines and an exhortation for aspiring bodhisattvas to follow suit.</p>

                        themselves to administrative duties, and by performing those duties, damage the efforts of other

                        of an enormous heap of nonvirtue, [F.150.b] and they will be gripped by karmic obscurations. Why
                        is that the case? Well, the three things that are the bases for producing merit all arise from
                        insight. Therefore, Maitreya, bodhisattvas who are engaged in administrative duties must not
                        create an obstacle to those bodhisattvas who are diligent in teaching and reciting

                        taught that they are limitless, and so there is no end to them at all. What are the twenty?
                        Maitreya, bodhisattvas who like pointless speculation (1) experience a great deal of suffering
                        and unhappiness in this very life, (2) their patience deteriorates, (3) their opponents rejoice
                        in that, (4) Māra, too, takes great satisfaction in that, (5) Māra’s company delights in that as
                        well, (6) virtuous qualities that have not yet arisen in them do not arise, (7) those that have
                        arisen disappear, (8) disputes, grudges, arguments, and conflicts increase, (9) those disputes,
                        arguments, and conflicts actively create the karma that leads to rebirth in the lower realms,
                        (10) they are bound to a course of sheer recklessness, (11) their tongue faculties will be
                        crude, (12) they do not properly retain Dharma transmissions they have previously received, (13)
                        their ears never hear the transmitted discourses they have not previously received, (14) they
                        abandon all their virtuous friends, (15) they quickly make bad friends, (16) the hardships they
                        undergo evoke revulsion, (17) they hear an uninterrupted flow of unpleasant words, (18) no
                        matter where they are reborn, they become doubtful, (19) in those lives, they draw nearer to the
                        eight states lacking leisure, and (20) when they dedicate themselves in a positive direction,
                        they always encounter obstacles. Maitreya, those twenty are a summary of the shortcomings of
                        liking pointless speculation. [F.151.b] They should be avoided.”</p>

                        One Amitāyus, are not attitudes generated by childish beings. They are not attitudes generated
                        by anyone other than holy beings. They are not attitudes generated by a defiled mind. </p>

                        shall put it this way: (1) By harboring resentment toward the conduct of any sentient being, one
                        will be incapable of taking rebirth in the buddha realm of the Thus-Gone One Amitāyus, and so
                        one needs to generate the positive attitude of loving kindness toward all beings. (2) One must
                        rid oneself of all enmity and generate the positive attitude of compassion for all beings. (3)
                        Without concern for life and limb, one must generate the determination to preserve the sacred
                        Dharma. (4) Through certainty in profound patience, one must develop the attitude of strong
                        dedication to the sacred Dharma. (5) Through not being stained by gain and respect, one must
                        generate the attitude of pure intention. (6) Through perfect recall, one generates the attitude
                        of regarding omniscience as extremely precious. (7) By being dauntless, one generates the
                        attitude of respecting all beings just like gurus. [F.153.b] (8) Through confidence in the
                        branches of awakening, one develops the attitude of not being satisfied with the taste of mere
                        short-lived meditative concentration. (9) Through non-adulteration, one generates the attitude
                        of a great assortment of virtuous roots. (10) Abandoning characterizations, one develops the
                        attitude of meditating upon recollection of the Buddha.</p>
