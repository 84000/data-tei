                                        a Mahāyāna sūtra in which the bodhisattva Vidyutprāpta
                                        (“Lightning Attainment”) asks the Buddha how someone can

                                                lustful, is quite long. Bodhisattvas understand that
                                                different sentient beings have different desires and
                                                that even the most lustful can be brought to
                                                maturity, that is to say, to the completion of the

                                                bodhisattva’s skillful means. The Buddha emphasizes
                                                that bodhisattvas can teach spontaneously, without
                                                effort or attachment, and he gives several analogies
                                                to illustrate the nondualistic action to which the
                                                bodhisattva must aspire.</p>

                                                are described following a similar pattern, but more
                                                briefly and with only one analogy. In the case of
                                                the angry, the Buddha tells bodhisattvas to be
                                                patient and compassionate to free beings from their
                                                anger. For the deluded, bodhisattvas must use their
                                                vast knowledge of doctrine to remove various false
                                                views, like a doctor who uses the appropriate
                                                medicine to cure a specific disease.</p>

                                                are attached to the objects of consciousness, i.e.,

                                                the four temperaments, and it seems to be intended
                                                for all sentient beings. The treasure of the Dharma
                                                consists of analytical knowledge of meaning,
                                                dharmas, language, and eloquence, and it is the
                                                basis of the bodhisattva’s teaching of the
                                                undifferentiated nature of dharmas.</p>

                                                another bodhisattva, Candradhvaja (“Moon Banner”),
                                                asks about the phrase “wisdom without effort.” In

                                                ninth-century origins. However, in the Denkarma, it

                                                completely clear, spotless round mirror is placed at

                                                without increase or diminishment, the round mirror
                                                does not think, ‘I made these various types of
                                                reflections.’ Nevertheless, if that round mirror is
                                                wiped well, all the reflections will spontaneously
                                                appear. In the same way, the bodhisattvas, by wiping
                                                well the round mirror of the dharmadhātu,

                                                not have a conception of duality, because they see
