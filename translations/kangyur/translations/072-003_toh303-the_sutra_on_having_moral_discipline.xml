                    importance of guarding it. It is difficult, he says, to obtain a human life and encounter the teachings of a buddha, let alone to
                    then take monastic vows and maintain moral discipline. But unlike just losing that one human life, which comes and then inevitably
                    is gone, the consequences of failing in moral discipline are grave and experienced over billions of lifetimes. The Buddha
                    continues in verse, praising moral discipline and its necessity as a foundation for engaging in the Dharma and attaining nirvāṇa.
                    He concludes his discourse with a reflection on the folly of pursuing fleeting worldly enjoyments.</p>

                        Buddha teaches his saṅgha of monks about the benefits of having moral discipline and the importance of guarding it. It is

                    <p tid="8">It is noteworthy that this is not designated a Mahāyāna sūtra<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-072-003-5"> The same is
                            true of most of the other texts classified in the Degé and other Tshalpa Kangyurs in this later part of the General Sūtra
                            section. According to the Degé Kangyur’s catalog (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar chag</foreign>, vol. lakṣmī, folio
                            123.a), the General Sūtra (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sde</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo mang</foreign>)
                            section is divided into 193 Mahāyāna sūtras (corresponding to Toh 94–286) and 73 “Hīnayāna” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">theg dman</foreign>) sūtras (Toh 287–359).</note> and does not address any explicitly Mahāyāna subjects. The Buddha
                        is only in the presence of monks, and he only instructs them on how to attain nirvāṇa and the higher realms, rather than
                        buddhahood. As the Buddha is addressing the monastic congregation, it can be assumed that the topic of moral discipline here
                        pertains to maintaining the vows of a fully ordained monk, and indeed he refers to taking monastic vows as if it were a given
                        for his audience.</p>

                    <p tid="9">In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, this sūtra is included in liturgical texts used in connection with the practice of
                        the Vinaya. It is also cited and quoted in texts related to the Vinaya, and several topical outlines (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sa bcad</foreign>) of the sūtra were composed by Tibetan authors. Additionally, there are
                        Tibetan commentaries on the sūtra itself, two of which we have consulted for this translation: one by the Rimé master Thupten
                        Chökyi Drakpa (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">thub bstan chos kyi grags pa</foreign>, 1823–1905) and one by the Geluk master
                        Losang Palden Tenzin Nyendrak (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">blo bzang dpal ldan bstan ’dzin snyan grags</foreign>, 1866–1928).
                        This sūtra is also, though less commonly, called <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra Praising Moral Discipline</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">tshul khrims rab bsngags kyi mdo</title>).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-072-003-7"> See “tshul
                            khrims rab bsngags kyi mdo” (1985). This title is also found referenced in Jamgön Kongtrül’s <title xml:lang="en">Treasury
                                of Knowledge</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">shes bya kun khyab mdzod</title>), which says that it is to be recited

                        of the Tibetan imperial catalogs. In all, we know little about the history of the Tibetan translation. </p>

                    <p tid="11">There was no known Sanskrit original of <title xml:lang="en">Having Moral Discipline</title> available until recently,
                        when a manuscript containing a collection of twenty sūtras was found in the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Bhikṣuṇī Vinītā published
                        a critical edition and English translation of this collection in the series Sanskrit Texts from the Autonomous Region (2010).
                        Unfortunately, due to the inaccessibility of the manuscript collection and because it is missing a final colophon, its origin
                        and date are currently unknown.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-072-003-10"> Currently the manuscript is kept in the Potala.
                            Vinītā’s critical edition is based on a copy of the manuscript that is kept in the China Tibetology Research Center. For
                            further details on the state of this manuscript, see Vinītā (2010), pp. xv–xvii.</note> There seems to be a thematic
                        connection among these twenty sūtras: Vinītā notes that moral discipline (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śīla</foreign>) is a recurrent theme in the manuscript,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-072-003-11"> Vinītā (2010), pp.
                            xxvii–xxix.</note> and we also can identify themes of karmic cause and effect and the hierarchy of merit. </p>

                    <p tid="12">There are many details of the Tibetan versions that vary significantly from the Sanskrit manuscript, although the
                        overall content is virtually the same. In the Sanskrit, the verses begin at the very start of the Buddha’s teaching (<ptr target="#UT22084-072-003-19"/>), whereas in the Tibetan the verse structure begins later (<ptr target="#UT22084-072-003-25"/>). Where the verses do begin in the Tibetan, there are some differences in the grouping of
                        lines, and at times the Sanskrit is wordier or contains entirely different content, although not enough to significantly alter
                        the meaning of the sūtra. We have attempted to group the lines of verse into stanzas by theme rather than into regular
                        quatrains, and though this results in a few stanzas with an irregular number of lines, it matches with the Sanskrit at enough
                        points to seem like a reasonable choice.</p>

This may be of interest as there are many texts called <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Sīlasutta</title> in the Pali canon, but as far as we can tell none are similar enough in content for a
                        clear relationship to be established. The Chinese text shows a significant degree of variation in the finer details as
                        compared to both the Sanskrit and the Tibetan, but it shares the same basic structure and does not depart from the content

                                context. It literally means something that “causes aggregation” or “causes to be put together.” In a general sense it
                                refers to any phenomenon that comes into being on the basis of causes and conditions. In more specific usage it is
                                also the term describing the fourth of the five aggregates and the second of the twelve links of dependent
                                origination. Although both of these latter uses have their own technical contexts, in both cases the term carries a
                                more active and volitional aspect and refers to the formative factors, mental volitions, and other supporting factors
                                that perpetuate birth in saṃsāra.</term>
