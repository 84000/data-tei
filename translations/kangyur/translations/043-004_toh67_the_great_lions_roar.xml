                                <p tid="2">In this sūtra, Mahākāśyapa poses a series of questions to
                                        the Buddha about proper monastic conduct and practice, which
                                        the Buddha answers at length. Mahākāśyapa then requests the
                                        Buddha to remain in the world in order to safeguard the
                                        Dharma, but when the Buddha initially predicts that
                                        Mahākāśyapa himself will do so in the future, Mahākāśyapa
                                        insists that for the Dharma to remain for long, it must be
                                        entrusted to a bodhisattva rather than a śrāvaka. The Buddha
                                        then anoints Maitreya and entrusts him with the
                                        responsibility of protecting the Dharma in the future. There
                                        follows a teaching from the Buddha about those in the future
                                        who will falsely claim to be bodhisattvas and about the
                                        proper conduct and practice of bodhisattvas, as well as a
                                        description from Maitreya of his own practice of the
                                        bodhisattva path. When Mahākāśyapa asks the Buddha about
                                        those in the future who will be “sham bodhisattvas,” the
                                        Buddha offers a series of teachings on the mistaken and
                                        blameworthy practice of commercializing the worship of
                                        relics, stūpas, and images and seeking to make a living
                                        thereby, contrasting this with a monastic’s proper practice
                                        of ascetic conduct and meditative inquiry. In addition to
                                        the Buddha’s criticism, this sūtra is notable for its
                                        memorable analogies, past life narratives, and emphasis on
                                        the ascetic practice of the forest-dwelling monastic.</p>

                                                and bodhisattva disciples, where Venerable
                                                Mahākāśyapa poses a series of questions to the

                                                of those who have gone forth, contrasting it with

                                                in the world “for an eon or longer” in order to
                                                safeguard the Dharma. The Buddha predicts that in

                                                Dharma, at which point Mahākāśyapa objects that the

                                                a śrāvaka rather than a bodhisattva, and he
                                                supplicates the Buddha to anoint Maitreya in his
                                                stead. The Buddha then commands Maitreya to take

                                                future, which he accepts. </p>

                                                describes at length the blameworthy qualities of
                                                those in the future who will “falsely claim to be
                                                bodhisattvas” and the proper conduct and practice of
                                                bodhisattvas, again utilizing a series of analogies
                                                as well as a narrative of one of his past lives.
                                                Maitreya roars his lion’s roar in response,
                                                describing his own diligent and ascetic practice of

                                        <p tid="13">Finally, Mahākāśyapa asks the Buddha how many
                                                “sham bodhisattvas” there will be in the future, and
                                                the Buddha answers by predicting that sham
                                                bodhisattvas will involve themselves in the worship
                                                of his relics rather than in proper practice. He
                                                elaborates by narrating another of his past lives,
                                                in which Maitreya in a former life also features,
                                                providing an extended critique of those who involve
                                                themselves in devotional practices focused on
                                                relics, stūpas, and images to the exclusion of
                                                ascetic practice and meditation. In particular, the
                                                Buddha criticizes those who would commercialize such
                                                devotional activities and seek to make a living
                                                thereby, narrating another of his past lives by way
                                                of illustration. In this way, the Buddha contrasts
                                                proper practice, focused on renunciation, moral
                                                discipline, and meditative inquiry, with the
                                                improper practice of commercializing devotional
                                                practices for mundane ends. </p>

                                                scholarship, Gregory Schopen has shown that there
                                                are multiple instances in the sūtra of vocabulary
                                                shared with the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, and
                                                Schopen’s analysis of the sūtra’s polemics against
                                                the commercialization of relic and image cults
                                                demonstrates either the direct influence of the
                                                Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya or the fact that the present

                                                  the present sūtra. It might also be noted that
                                                  Schopen suggests that the fact that the sūtra
                                                  never uses the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mahāyāna</foreign> but only <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Bodhisattva­yāna</foreign> (“vehicle of the
                                                  bodhisattvas”) might indicate a relatively early
                                                  date for this sūtra’s first appearance vis-à-vis

                                                In that regard, it is perhaps of interest that some
                                                of the sūtra’s criticism and instruction is aimed at
                                                śrāvaka as well as bodhisattva monastics, not to
                                                mention the sūtra’s promotion of the ideal of the
                                                forest-dwelling monastic and, in general, its view
                                                of the merits of monastic life in comparison to the
                                                life of lay householders. For example, the sūtra
                                                refers with approval to a supposed previous age in
                                                which literally everyone left their homes to take up
                                                the religious life, so that not even one householder
                                                remained. </p>

                                                arising. In this case, <ref cRef="F.99.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-043-004-630"/> to
                                                generate the thought of awakening means there is
                                                simply no clinging to any phenomena. Why is that? It
                                                is because wherever there is clinging there is
                                                arising, but wherever there is no clinging there is
                                                no arising. Since that is so, Blessed One, arising
                                                itself has no arising. Why “no arising”? Because
                                                there is nothing to serve as a basis for arising,
                                                there is, for that reason, “no arising.” As for the
                                                absence of arising, that verbal expression is itself
                                                inexpressible. Why is that? Because, to whatever
                                                extent verbal expression exists, to that extent
                                                arising and ceasing exist. Thus, utterly pure wisdom
                                                is without arising and without ceasing. That which
                                                has no arising and no ceasing is inexhaustible since
                                                it is permanently inexhaustible. Blessed One, since
                                                this is so, we both pray, on account of the pinnacle
                                                of sameness, for supreme and perfect awakening,
                                                without apprehending any qualities whatsoever,
                                                without attaining any qualities whatsoever, and
                                                without seeking to attain any qualities whatsoever.
                                                We have already understood just that which is
                                                sameness, but we do not understand any phenomena
                                                whatsoever. Why is that? Because all phenomena are
                                                primordially pure.’ </p>

                                                The body of the Tathāgata is also characterized in
                                                that way. Just as this image of the Tathāgata
