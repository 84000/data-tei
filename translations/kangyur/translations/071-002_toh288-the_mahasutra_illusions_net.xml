                    <title xml:lang="en">The Mahāsūtra “Illusion’s Net”</title> is a discourse taught
                    by the Buddha Śākyamuni to an assembly of monks in Śrāvastī, in Prince Jeta’s Grove,
                    Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. The Buddha opens his discourse by stressing how, among the three
                    trainings in discipline, contemplation, and wisdom, the training in wisdom holds a
                    particular importance. Perfecting the training in wisdom, he says, naturally brings the
                    other two trainings to perfection too. The remainder of the sūtra describes how monks
                    should train in wisdom by examining the futility and folly of their emotional reactions to
                    the objects of the five senses and mental phenomena. Discussing each of these in
                    succession, the Buddha describes how ordinary sensory and mental perceptions are deluded,
                    and how getting caught up in such perceptions only causes pain and regret. The five
                    sensory objects and the mental objects are each described with nearly identical phrasing,
                    supplemented by individual analogies. These analogies, the sūtra states in its concluding
                    summary, constitute the “net of illusion” to which the title of this discourse refers.</p>

                        sūtra. Essentially, it involves a continuing examination of the futility and folly of
                        one’s emotional reactions to what one perceives, namely objects of the five senses and
                        objects in the mind. The Buddha discusses successively these different kinds of
                        perception. He describes how ordinary sensory and mental perceptions are deluded, and
                        how getting caught up in them causes pain and regret. The passages on each of the six
                        kinds of object comprise almost identical phrasing, using key terms such as the four
                        psychophysical bonds that tie beings to cyclic existence, and the four misconceptions
                        through which they misinterpret the real nature of their experience. Within each of
                        these six similar passages, however, the Buddha adds two unique analogies, one
                        illustrating the sobering shift of mindset from folly to wisdom, and the other
                        depicting examples of perceptual illusion; the analogies are mostly not direct
                        references to the sensory mode being discussed. </p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Mahāsūtra “Illusion’s Net”</title> belongs to a

                        from a corpus of discourses important to the Kashmiri Mūlasarvāstivādin textual
                        community. The Mahāsūtras, in addition to their practical function as a compact canon
                        that represented the four Āgama collections in shortened form, were also employed as
                        protective texts (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">rakṣā</foreign>).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-071-002-58">Skilling 2012, pp. 63–88. For more on the

                        Doctrinally, all the works in this corpus draw on an early and fundamental layer of

                        what causes our suffering and keeps us circling in saṃsāra is our failure to perceive
                        the world as it really is, and our tendency instead to fall prey to the perceptual
                        distortions caused by assessing what our senses tell us in terms of our mistaken
                        belief in a self. These distorted perceptions form the “illusion’s net” to which the
                        title refers, trapping sentient beings in its bonds. It is noteworthy that in the

                            that unfortunately does not receive a thorough enough treatment in Sanskrit
                            Buddhist literature to provide the proper context for its interpretation. Skilling
                            defers to the following insightful comments from Nārada Mahā Thera on the
                            presentation of the kāyagranthas in the Theravāda tradition: “<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Ganthas </foreign>are those that bind mind with
                            body or the present body with bodies of future existences. Here the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāya</foreign> is used in the sense of mass or
                            body—both mental and physical.” See Skilling 2012, pp. 240–41. Nārada Mahā Thera’s
                            interpretation of the term has been adopted here, and it appears to agree with the
                            interpretation of a similar group of four in Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche’s <title xml:lang="en">Gateway to Knowledge</title> (see Pema Kunsang 2000 and the next
                            note).</note> of covetousness, malice, a sense of moral and ascetic supremacy, and
                        thinking, “This is the truth,” and clinging to it as real—and then I must abandon
                            them.’<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-071-002-79"> These correspond to the four

                                    existence, whether physical or mental. These comprise (1) the suffering of
                                    suffering, i.e., the physical sensations and mental experiences that are
                                    self-evident as suffering and toward which spontaneous feelings of
                                    aversion arise; (2) the suffering of change, i.e., all experiences that
                                    are normally recognized as pleasant and desirable, but which are
                                    nonetheless suffering in that persistent indulgence in these always
                                    results in changing attitudes of dissatisfaction and boredom; and (3) the

                                    aging, and death.</p>
