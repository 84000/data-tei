                    Teaching the Unfathomable Secrets of the Tathāgatas is a fascinating third turning mahayāna sūtra extracted from the larger Ratnakūṭa sūtra that explores a diversity of topics across 24 chapters and an epilogue.
                </p>
                <p tid="3">
                    Both the Buddha and Vajrapāṇi teach, discussing the secrets of the body, speech, and mind of the bodhisattvas and the buddhas, nonduality, the relationship of the nature of mind to the qualities of buddhas and bodhisattvas, and other subjects. It follows a consistently nondual perspective — identifying that while an awakened being may seem to be engaged in a conceptual or dualistic action, they never leave the scope of nonconceptual wisdom. It reveals the extraordinary freedom that awakened beings have in their acting in the world.

                <p tid="2">In this sūtra, the narrative largely revolves around the figures of
                    Vajrapāṇi, the yakṣa lord and constant companion of the Buddha, and the Buddha
                    himself. In the first half of the sūtra, Vajrapāṇi gives a series of teachings
                    on the mysteries or secrets of the body, speech, and mind of bodhisattvas and
                    the realized ones. In the second half of the sūtra, Vajrapāṇi describes several
                    events in the Buddha’s life: his practice of severe asceticism, his approach to
                    the seat of awakening, his defeat of Māra, his awakening, and his turning of the
                    wheel of Dharma. Following this, the Buddha gives a prediction of Vajrapāṇi’s
                    future awakening as a buddha and travels to Vajrapāṇi’s abode for a meal.
                    Interspersed throughout the sūtra are sermons, dialogues, and marvelous tales
                    exploring a large number of topics and featuring an extensive cast of
                    characters, including several narratives about past lives of Vajrapāṇi, Brahmā
                    Sahāṃpati, and the Buddha himself. The sūtra concludes with the performance of
                    two long dhāraṇīs, one by Vajrapāṇi and one by the Buddha, for the protection
                    and preservation of the Dharma.</p>

                    under the supervision of Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche. A first draft was made from the

                    others. David Fiordalis thoroughly revised the translation with close reference
                    to the extant Sanskrit manuscript, as well as the Tibetan translation. Fiordalis
                    also wrote the summary, introduction, annotations, and most of the glossary
                    entries. Fiordalis would like to acknowledge Paul Harrison, who furnished him
                    with his own digital images of the Sanskrit manuscript, and Péter-Dániel Szántó,
                    who generously made his transcription of the manuscript available for

                            (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgataguhya</title>) can be called, without
                        exaggeration, a great work of Mahāyāna Buddhist literature. It deserves to
                        be considered a work of literature in the narrower sense of a form of verbal
                        expression of enduring artistic merit, a work of the creative imagination
                        that may elicit pleasure, wonder, and many other responses from an audience,
                        and not simply in the broader sense of literature as a body of written (or
                        oral) works in general. In that narrower sense, it is comparable to better
                        known works of Mahāyāna Buddhist literature, such as <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of Vimalakīrti</title> (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vimalakīrti­nirdeśa</title>, Toh 176), the literary merits of which are
                        already well established, and <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title>
                            (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title>, Toh 95), which deserves
                        more recognition in this regard.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-64"> For example, Étienne Lamotte once called
                            the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vimalakīrti­nirdeśa</title> “perhaps the
                            crown jewel of the Buddhist literature of the Great Vehicle,” in <title xml:lang="fr">L’Enseignment de Vimalakīrti</title> (Lamotte 1987, p.
                            v), while more recently Jonathan Silk has made a softer claim,
                            describing it as “one of the most radiant stars in the firmament of
                            Mahāyāna sūtra literature,” on the back cover of <title xml:lang="en">Vimalakīrtinirdeśa: The Teaching of Vimalakīrti</title> (Gómez and

                            2022, especially pp. 285 and following. We would also like to
                            acknowledge here our indebtedness to Gómez and Harrison’s translation of
                            the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vimalakīrti­nirdeśa</title>. We have used

                            translation, as well as their explanations for our glossary.</note> Both
                        of these latter works would seem to bear a close relationship to <title xml:lang="en">The Secrets of the Realized Ones</title> in other respects
                        as well, and it to them.</p>

                        to the secrets (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhya</foreign>) of

                        because of the common association of literature with fiction and religious
                        works with nonfiction. Yet, many of the same arguments that have been used
                        for decades to justify the claim that the Bible, whatever else it may be, is
                        a great work of literature would hold for these works of Buddhist

                            see Shaw 2021. A classic in the field of literary studies of the Bible

                        to suggest that the doctrinal elements are less worthy of serious and
                        careful consideration. Indeed, the sūtra and the characters in it make some
                        rather remarkable claims, and the doctrinal and literary dimensions are
                        deeply interwoven throughout. For example, among the most striking claims in
                        the sūtra is one made about the Buddha, a claim that is restated in <title xml:lang="en">The Descent into Laṅka </title>and is quoted by

                        longer Perfection of Wisdom sūtras. At one point, Vajrapāṇi says the
                        following:</p>

                            into complete cessation, the Realized One has not articulated and will

                    <p tid="16">If taken at face value, how can such an astonishing claim be true?
                        Vajrapāṇi will explain further that over the same period of time the Buddha
                        does not form any thought whatsoever but dwells in a constant state of
                        meditative <term rend="ignore">absorption</term>. Nevertheless, Vajrapāṇi
                        continues, various beings hear the Dharma and believe that the Buddha is
                        speaking to them in accordance with their own aspirations and motivations.
                        Here is an example of how the sūtra employs a literary device to explain
                        this complex idea with a concrete analogy: </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-77"/>
                    <q>
                        <p tid="17">“Śāntamati, this is analogous to a well-crafted musical
                            instrument, a wind bell, which makes a sweet sound without being touched
                            by a hand, but rather when it is moved by the wind. It does not make any
                            special effort to produce a sound, but still it makes a sweet sound
                            because of the special nature of its previous preparation. In the same
                            way, Śāntamati, a realized one’s speech comes out when it is moved by
                            knowledge of beings’ motivations, but a realized one does not make any
                            special effort in this regard to produce it. Rather, a realized one’s
                            speech conforms to the sense perceptions of all beings because of the
                            special nature of a realized one’s previous preparation.”</p>

                    <p tid="18">This is one of three analogies Vajrapāṇi uses to explain this idea,
                        all of which are quoted in Candrakīrti’s <title xml:lang="en">Clear
                            Words</title>. It is just one example that serves to illustrate how the
                        sūtra addresses one of the major questions posed by the work: what is the
                            <term rend="ignore">true nature</term> of a buddha? In answering this
                        question, the whole work could be said to promote the idea that a buddha, by
                        the very nature of becoming awakened to the <term rend="ignore">true
                            nature</term> of reality, exists in a state of all-pervasive, unlimited,
                        and pure potentiality, a state that is identical to the <term rend="ignore">true nature</term> of reality itself. As a result, the Buddha
                        simultaneously actualizes an infinite number of different forms while
                        remaining constantly in that state of pure potentiality. The work explains
                        the mechanism behind this process to some extent, using analogies like the
                        one just quoted above, but at the same time it remains to a large degree
                        mysterious or incomprehensible: it is the secret and the mystery of a
                        realized one’s body, speech, and mind. </p>

                            Ones</title> expresses an idea about the Buddha that has sometimes been
                        compared with docetism, which is the early Christian idea that the body of
                        Jesus Christ was not a body of flesh and blood, but a phantasm. On the face
                        of it, <title xml:lang="en">The Secrets of the Realized Ones</title> would
                        seem to make a similar claim about the body of the Buddha. Yet, its

                        mysteries of the Buddha, and from the point of view of its narrative, the
                        same could be said about the one who discloses those secrets, namely
                        Vajrapāṇi, the yakṣa who is called throughout the sūtra “the lord of the
                        guhyakas” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhyakādhipati</foreign>);
                        that is, the lord of “the hidden ones” or perhaps even the lord of “the
                        guardians of what is hidden.” Narratives tell of events, sequenced,
                        structured into a plot, and featuring characters who perform actions and
                        experience their effects. Since this narrative largely centers on Vajrapāṇi,
                        he could be considered its protagonist or the “hero” of the story. He is
                        called the Buddha’s constant companion, eyewitness to his many deeds, and
                        guardian of his secrets. The Buddha tells of Vajrapāṇi’s past lives,
                        explaining how he came to serve in that capacity and to possess such a
                        capability. In this respect, he is put on the same level with Brahmā
                        Sahāṃpati, who requests the Buddha to teach the Dharma. The Buddha also
                        gives a prediction of Vajrapāṇi’s future awakening as a buddha in his own
                        right, after which the Buddha accepts Vajrapāṇi’s invitation to come to his
                        home for a meal. The sūtra tells of the Buddha’s visit and of the teachings
                        the Buddha offers to the various nonhuman creatures who live in Vajrapāṇi’s
                        abode. In this way, the sūtra develops the character of Vajrapāṇi and
                        explains his close relationship with the Buddha.</p>

                        or capitalized “the Realized One,” when it refers specifically to the Buddha

                        centuries, and many translators today opt to leave it untranslated. The
                        Tibetan translators chose to render it in a way that can be translated as

                        grammar of the compound in Pali and Sanskrit can easily tolerate, and
                        indeed, there is something quite compelling about the specific narrative
                        context in which the Buddha, when he first approaches his five former

                        third person as “the one who has come thus” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgata</foreign>). </p>

                        context as one of the most common epithets of the Buddha and for the
                        buddhas, generally speaking. In Pali literature, it is the most common way
                        that the Buddha refers to himself, and when he does so in this way he is
                        often also speaking by implication about the nature of a buddha in general.

                        speaker, such as the Buddha or Vajrapāṇi in this sūtra, is speaking in
                        particular about the Realized One (the Buddha Śākyamuni himself), often on
                        the basis of something the speaker has himself witnessed, or if a broader
                        generalization is being made about the realized ones. So, when we have felt
                        that the speaker is making a more general claim, we have sometimes
                        translated the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgata</foreign> as “a realized one.” Even still, it is important

                        recognized the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgata</foreign> to have several semantic levels. For instance, in
                        the Pali commentaries, the great scholar-monk Buddhaghosa offers eight
                        different explanations of the meaning of the term.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-92"> For a study and translation of this

                        explanation here, one may note that the term suggests not only literal

                        and “coming” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">āgamana</foreign>), but
                        also a sense of having “understood” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gata</foreign>) or “realized” something, of becoming it or making it
                        real. In this context, the adverb <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathā</foreign>, “thus” or “in that way,” is connected to <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathatā</foreign>, “the way things truly
                        are.” In this way one can understand the comment made in <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of Vimalakīrti</title> about the love of a
                        bodhisattva: “it is the love of a realized one (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgata</foreign>), because it understands the way things

                        to the buddhas, to those who have come and gone in the way they do, and it
                        carries the sense that they have understood directly the way things are, and
                        even that this understanding has made them the way they are.</p>

                        explain the secrets of the bodhisattvas and the realized ones. Vajrapāṇi
                        remains silent, but after the Buddha Śākyamuni intercedes on Śāntamati’s
                        behalf, Vajrapāṇi begins to give the teaching.</p>

                    <p tid="31">Vajrapāṇi’s teaching of these secrets of bodhisattvas and of
                        realized ones is structured in terms of their body, speech, and mind, and
                        their mysterious or inconceivable nature. Beginning with an explanation of
                        the secret of the bodhisattva’s body, Vajrapāṇi provides a number of
                        memorable images. He tells a story of the ancient past about the Buddha when
                        he was still a bodhisattva and had been born as Śakra, King of the Gods, a
                        close parallel telling of which is also found in the Collected Teachings on
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bodhisattva</title>. During a great pandemic,
                        Śakra manifests himself as a magical creature that heals everyone by
                        offering them its body to eat. Vajrapāṇi also gives an analogy that is
                        quoted in <title xml:lang="en">The Training Anthology</title> in which he
                        compares the healing power of the bodhisattva’s body to the healing powers
                        of a girl made from medicinal herbs by the king of physicians. In his
                        teaching, Vajrapāṇi expounds upon the implications of the fact that
                        bodhisattvas and buddhas possess the Dharma body (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharmakāya</foreign>) and thereby manifest all forms but are

                        of any kind of sound or means of communication whatsoever. Their speech is

                        Sahāṃpati, who vows to request all the buddhas of this Fortunate Eon to

                        begins with the body, which he explains can appear as virtually anything,

                        Perhaps the main idea of this chapter is that the Buddha never utters a

                        Śāntamati asks Vajrapāṇi to describe four events in the Buddha’s life: his
                        practice of severe asceticism, his defeat of Māra, his awakening, and his
                        turning of the wheel of Dharma. Vajrapāṇi does so, and describes in detail
                        various wonders and episodes related to these events. In the presentation of
                        these events, there are some close similarities with versions found in other
                        sūtras, particularly <title xml:lang="en">The Play in Full</title>, but
                        Vajrapāṇi’s telling emphasizes the fact that different beings perceive these
                        events differently based on their own needs and suppositions. For instance,
                        when the Buddha delivers the first sermon, Vajrapāṇi notes that the
                        innumerable beings on hand to witness the event hear different teachings
                        about different topics, based on their own thoughts and motivations.
                        [Tibetan chapters 11 through 14 end.] After Vajrapāṇi completes his
                        description of these events, the Buddha affirms the accuracy of Vajrapāṇi’s
                        retelling. [Sanskrit chapter 6 ends.]</p>

                    <p tid="40">Then, after being prompted by Śāntamati, the Buddha offers some
                        teachings of his own on the nature of calming the mind or bringing it to
                        rest, as well as bringing one’s emotions and, indeed, all things to rest. It
                        is a highly sophisticated dialogue that takes one deeply into the philosophy
                        of emptiness and its connection to other elements of Buddhist doctrine,
                        including the explanation of the process of cognition whereby the mind
                        generates thoughts on the basis of specific objects or bases of cognition
                            (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ālaṃbana</foreign>). This
                        chapter is quoted at some length by Candrakīrti in <title xml:lang="en">The

                        some bodhisattvas desire to know when Vajrapāṇi will become a buddha.
                        Knowing their thoughts in his mind, the Buddha then smiles and gives a
                        prediction of Vajrapāṇi’s future awakening. [Tibetan chapter 16 ends;
                        Sanskrit chapter 7 ends.] </p>

                    <p tid="41">This prediction then becomes the basis for a profound and rather
                        complex dialogue between Śāntamati and Vajrapāṇi, reminiscent of certain
                        dialogues in <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of Vimalakīrti</title>. In
                        this dialogue, Śāntamati makes assertions and poses questions largely from a
                        conventional point of view, beginning with the assertion that Vajrapāṇi has
                        just received a prediction of his future awakening. Vajrapāṇi, on the other
                        hand, responds to Śāntamati’s assertions and answers his questions from the
                        standpoint of emptiness. The logic of the exchange employs a number of puns
                        and plays on words, stretching the ordinary and technical meanings of terms
                        and relying on dual meanings to argue for the nondual and empty nature of
                        all phenomena. In some ways, the dialogue constitutes a further explanation
                        of the paradoxical claims made earlier that the Buddha does not speak a word
                        and yet the Dharma is expressed nonetheless. [Tibetan chapter 17 ends.] </p>

                    <p tid="42">Vajrapāṇi then invites the Buddha to his home for a meal. The Buddha
                        agrees, and Vajrapāṇi goes home to prepare for the Buddha’s visit. The whole
                        episode includes a rather ornate series of miraculous performances, a
                        marvelous display that again bears some similarities with wonders described
                        elsewhere in Buddhist literature. The Buddha arrives and has a meal.
                        [Tibetan chapter 18 ends.] Afterward, he gives a profound and difficult
                        teaching on the Dharma to the nonhuman and divine beings gathered there,
                        touching upon a variety of complex topics in the Buddhist philosophy of the
                        path, organized around a number of themes and concepts, including the nature
                        of faith or strong belief, how a person can know if a teacher is a true
                        companion in the good, the twelvefold chain of dependent arising and its
                        connection to emptiness, and the nature and benefit of being watchful and
                        attentive to one’s thoughts. Parts of this teaching are quoted in both
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra Anthology</title> and <title xml:lang="en">The Training Anthology</title>, and there is also a long

                            Bodhisattva</title>. Toward the end of the sermon, the four Lokapālas
                        ask for a teaching on how to protect the world, which the Buddha gives to
                        them in such a way that it forms a kind of synopsis of many key elements of
                        Buddhist doctrine. [Tibetan chapter 19 ends.] As the Buddha gets ready to
                        leave Vajrapāṇi’s abode, he asks Vajrapāṇi to recite a dhāraṇī for the
                        protection and preservation of the Dharma, which Vajrapāṇi does, and then
                        the Buddha returns to Vulture Peak. [Tibetan chapter 20 ends.]</p>

                    <p tid="43">Once the Buddha has returned to Vulture Peak, King Ajātaśatru comes
                        to visit him, and he asks him a series of questions about Vajrapāṇi and the
                        reasons why the Buddha visited his home. In response, the Buddha tells a
                        past life story about a bodhisattva named Śūrabala, which serves to explain
                        the reason for or source of Vajrapāṇi’s marvelous inspired eloquence. This
                        story contains some rather complex teachings in the dialogue narrated by the
                        Buddha between Śūrabala and a past buddha named Vaiśramaṇa about the nature
                        of the bodhisattva path and the paradoxical nature of the bodhisattva’s
                        field of action, a dialogue that concludes with a series of artful metaphors
                        by Śūrabala. [Tibetan chapter 21 ends; Sanskrit chapter 9 ends.]</p>

                    <p tid="44">The next chapter features an entertaining episode in which Vajrapāṇi
                        sets his vajra on the ground, and Ajātaśatru, Śakra, and Maudgalyāyana all
                        try to lift it. None of them is able to do so. The Buddha then directs
                        Vajrapāṇi to lift the vajra, which he does as a demonstration of his
                        extraordinary power. He then throws it into the <term rend="ignore">air</term>, and after it circles the cosmos several times, it returns
                        to him, like Thor’s hammer. The episode prompts a discussion of how it is
                        possible for a bodhisattva to attain such incredible power. This, again,
                        leads to another profound dialogue between the Buddha and Ajātaśatru on the
                        natural consequences of practicing the Buddhist path. [Tibetan chapter 22

                        Śāntamati and Vajrapāṇi return to the foreground of the narrative. Śāntamati
                        asks Vajrapāṇi to request the Buddha to empower the teachings given in the
                        sūtra so that they will last for a long time. This request forms the basis
                        of a dialogue on the nature and means of remembering the Dharma, taking into
                        account the ultimate perspective that nothing is truly grasped or retained.
                        During the conversation, a god named Bhadrarāja stands up and offers some
                        perspectives on the nature of the inspired eloquence needed to teach the
                        Dharma. [Tibetan chapter 23 ends.] </p>

                        such inspired eloquence, and the Buddha responds by exploring the connection
                        between inspired eloquence and the development of a powerful memory and the
                        mnemonic formulas that support it (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign>). The Buddha explains that Bhadrarāja possesses a
                        powerful mnemonic formula that affords him the ability to teach the Dharma
                        with inspired eloquence. What follows is another dazzling display of word
                        play as the Buddha explains how this mnemonic formula provides access to the
                        nature of reality as well as the true teachings. Bhadrarāja underscores the
                        Buddha’s teaching with a series of beautiful analogies about the bodhisattva
                        who has acquired a powerful memory and the formulas that support it.

                        purpose of preserving the Dharma and seemingly this sūtra in particular.
                        Afterward, the Buddha tells one more brief story from a past life of his
                        own, about the value of remembering the Dharma. He then asks the audience to
                        remember this sūtra. Various characters come forward and promise to do so,
                        and finally the Buddha entrusts the sūtra to Ānanda and directs him to teach
                        it to others. This draws the sūtra to a close. [Tibetan chapter 25 ends;

                        other works. The most stable title of the sūtra, the one most used across a

                        mostly by this shorter form of the title throughout this

                        it is given in the Tibetan translation and in a Sanskrit transliteration in
                        the Kangyur, is a somewhat complicated issue. The Tibetan translation gives
                        the title in Tibetan as <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa de bzhin gshegs
                            pa’i gsang ba bsam gyis mi khyab pa bstan pa</title>, and it renders the
                        title in Sanskrit as <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ārya­tathāgatācintyaguhya­nirdeśa</title>. These titles correspond
                        closely to one another, except for the fact that the order of the Sanskrit
                        words corresponding to <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gsang

                        There are various ways to account for the difference. The key issue is to
                        decide on an interpretation of the relationship between these words. Since
                        both terms can be used as a noun or adjective, it must be decided if one is
                        functioning as a noun and the other as an adjective, or if they should both
                        be understood as nouns.</p>

                    <p tid="53">However, there is another passage found earlier in the text<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-1462">See <ptr target="#UT22084-039-003-466"/>.</note> in which the phrase <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">tathāgata­kāyaguhyācintya­nirdeśa</foreign> is extant in the Sanskrit
                        manuscript. While the corresponding Tibetan translation of this phrase,

                        identical to it, and it is identical as well to the main part of the Tibetan
                        title given for the sūtra as a whole. Furthermore, in another passage near
                        the beginning of the sūtra, for which the Sanskrit is unfortunately lacking,
                        Vajrapāṇi speaks of four “inconceivables” or “mysteries” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bsam gyis mi khyab pa ’di bzhi</foreign>),
                        one of which is “the mystery of the buddha(s)” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sangs rgyas bsam gyis mi khyab pa</foreign>). Here, the term
                        translated as “mystery”—that is, something incomprehensible or
                        inconceivable—would seem to be used as a noun and as a shorter form of the
                        phrase “the mysterious qualities of the buddha(s)” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sangs rgyas kyi chos bsam gyis mi khyab
                            pa</foreign>, *<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">acintya­buddha­dharma</foreign>). It also appears to be used here
                        almost as a synonym for the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhya</foreign>—that is, something “hidden” or “concealed,” or a
                        “secret.” </p>

                    <p tid="54">Based on the evidence above, it looks as though the full title in
                        the Tibetan translation may be the result of a process of development based
                        on a combination of at least two of the ways the text refers to itself and
                        to its subject matter. The terms <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhya</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gsang
                            ba</foreign>) and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">acintya</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bsam gyis mi
                            khyab pa</foreign>) can be used as nouns and as near synonyms or close
                        equivalents. That is to say, “the incomprehensible or mysterious qualities
                        of the buddhas” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">acintya­buddha­dharma</foreign>) are basically equivalent to “the
                        secrets of the realized ones” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgataguhya</foreign>). At the same time, both terms can function as
                        adjectives of one another, and thus it is still possible to understand the
                        relevant phrases in the title as either “secret/hidden mysteries” or
                        “mysterious/incomprehensible (number of) secrets.” Given all these
                        possibilities, we have simply chosen to translate the phrase as if both
                        terms were used as nouns and as near synonyms, and thus we have translated
                        the long title as <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of the Mysteries and
                            Secrets of the Realized Ones</title>.</p>

                    <p tid="55">At the same time, we should remember that the sūtra has been called
                            <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of the Lord of the Guhyakas</title>
                            (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyakādhi­pati­nirdeśa</title>), and the
                        Buddha calls it <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter of Vajrapāṇi</title>
                            (*<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajra­pāṇiparivarta</title>) in the sūtra
                        itself. Since Vajrapāṇi is called the Lord of the Guhyakas throughout the
                        sūtra and he is arguably its main protagonist, as well as being the speaker
                        of the majority of the teachings in the sūtra, it is easy to understand why
                        it has acquired these titles. However, they also highlight the need to
                        understand the relationship between the words <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhya</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">guhyaka</foreign>, as well as the relationship between the guhyakas and
                        Vajrapāṇi, which is not a straightforward matter, as we have seen above.</p>

                        the sūtra. At some point, it seems that the sūtra also came to be known by
                        the title <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata­guhyaka</title>. This is the
                        title given to the manuscript G10765 by the archivists at the Asiatic
                        Society in Bengal, perhaps because this phrase is part of the description of
                        the work in the colophon to the final chapter, or perhaps it was because the
                        first page of the manuscript seems to be from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamāja Tantra</title>, which for some reason also seems to have
                        gone by the name <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata­guhyaka</title> in
                            Nepal.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-126"> On this point, see
                            the remarks by Cecil Bendall on Cambridge MS Adds. 901, 1365, and 1617

                        such that Maurice Winternitz, who translated a couple of the passages from

                        quoted in <title xml:lang="en">The Training Anthology</title>, felt it

                            Tantra</title> came to be known as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata­guhyaka</title> in Nepal, apart from the fact that it also
                        discusses the secrets of the body, speech, and mind of the realized ones, as

                        and the various Buddhist tantras, are topics that await further

                            Secrets of the Realized Ones</title> is such a great work of Buddhist
                        literature and had such an influence, why does it seem to have fallen into
                        obscurity at a later point in time, even as the transmission and study of
                        other Buddhist sūtras continued to flourish? It is true that a text called
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata­guhyaka</title> came to be listed
                        among the nine dharmas or books (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">grantha</foreign>) of Newari Buddhism in Nepal sometime in the early to
                        middle of the second millennium, which suggests it may have continued to
                        enjoy a high status there for some time. This conclusion, however, is
                        mitigated by the fact that it is not clear whether this title was initially
                        meant to refer to this sūtra or to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamāja
                            Tantra</title>, which also came to be known in Nepal as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgata­guhyaka</title>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-129"> Lewis 2000, pp. 15–16; Tuladhar-Douglas

                            46.</note> So, the popularity of this sūtra in Nepal is not a given;
                        yet, neither can the possibility of its popularity there be entirely
                        discounted. If it was meant to be one of the nine dharmas at one time, then
                        perhaps the lack of availability of the sūtra as a complete manuscript
                        contributed to its replacement by the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamāja
                            Tantra</title> in the list of nine dharmas at a later point, or perhaps
                        it was not meant to be one of the nine dharmas in the first place. These
                        historical questions require more research, as do the questions of its
                        reception and influence in the Buddhist traditions of Tibet and East
                        Asia.</p>

                    <p tid="59">If the lack of attention it has so far received from modern
                        scholarship is any indication, however, then evidently the sūtra fell into
                        relative obscurity at some point. If one were to indulge in further
                        speculation, perhaps the fact that <title xml:lang="en">The Teaching of
                            Vimalakīrti</title> features a wealthy layman contributed to its
                        popularity in China, which in turn led to the greater attention it has
                        received to this point from modern scholars in Japan and the West. By
                        contrast, the main character of <title xml:lang="en">The Secrets of the
                            Realized Ones</title> is a powerful, enigmatic, and somewhat threatening
                        nonhuman creature who brandishes a mighty weapon. While Vajrapāṇi may be a
                        crucial figure in the history of Buddhist literature for several reasons,
                        including his association with the preservation and promulgation of the
                        tantras, perhaps <title xml:lang="en">The Secrets of the Realized
                            Ones</title> came to be superseded at some point by other works, or
                        perhaps Vajrapāṇi’s enigmatic status lessened its popularity over time. Then
                        again, maybe it is just an accidental occurrence over the long history of
                        Buddhism that <title xml:lang="en">The Secrets of the Realized Ones</title>
                        has only recently begun to receive the renewed attention it deserves. </p>

                        only since 2012 or so that the sūtra has begun to receive much more than a
                        cursory footnote or simple acknowledgement of its existence in published
                        scholarly research. The most sustained scholarly attention has come from

                            Inde,” pp. 140–44, wherein Lamotte gives a three-page summary of the
                            past-life story told in chapter 5 of the sūtra (according to the chapter
                            divisions of the eleventh-century Chinese translation, which seems to
                            follow those of the Tibetan translation), in which Brahmā and Vajrapāṇi
                            each take a vow. The former vows to request each of the thousand buddhas
                            of this fortunate era to teach the Dharma, and the latter vows to become
                            the constant companion of each and every one of these buddhas. However,
                            it seems as though Lamotte did not finish reading the sūtra, because
                            after his synopsis of the story he claims that no mention is made in the
                            sūtra of when or how Vajrapāṇi attains future awakening as a buddha, but
                            this information is given in a later chapter of the sūtra (chapter 16

                        thousand monks, as well as eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas of great
                        courage, who were well known on account of their fame, a great many of whom
                        had come from other buddha domains. All of them had attained the state of

                            translation of “Māra in all his forms” is that Buddhist literature
                            generally recognizes several types of Māra. See, for instance, the entry

                        one, they undertake the pure conduct of the bodhisattva, and they make

                        towns, market towns, countries, and capital cities. However, they are not
                        seen by any of the māras, nor do they become visible to them. They make
                        themselves seen, yet they do not appear to be seen. Though they are not

                        these causes and objective supports. They know the body to be like a blade

                        as beings continue to be reborn, and for as long as they continue to be
                        reborn, these bodhisattvas make use of language. The knowledge and vision of
                        the bodhisattvas penetrates without impediment beings’ use of language in
                        all the ways they express linguistic utterances, verbal expressions,

                        he went beneath that banyan tree to take his meal. He came before the sage,

                        knowledge, not by taking pride in it. Also, they undertake their work with
                        knowledge without weakening any of the supernormal faculties. They manifest
                        all sorts of actions while making child’s play of the supernormal faculties.
                        They have attained the great mastery that is the mastery of the supernormal
                        faculties. The supernormal faculties they possess are an aspect of knowledge
                        because they are connected with the supreme knowledge of all aspects. The
                        supernormal faculties they possess are an aspect of wisdom because they
                        provide a direct vision of all things. The supernormal faculties they
                        possess have the aspect of inexhaustibility because they conform with
                        everything. Because all forms do not have a form, the supernormal faculties

                        thoughts of all beings, because they can perceive and thoroughly investigate
                        the true nature of mind. The supernormal faculties they possess can
                        recollect limitless eons, because they do not place any limits on the past
                        or the future. The supernormal faculties they possess can produce every kind
                        of wondrous transformation with their superhuman powers because they have
                        the defining characteristic of being unconditioned. The supernormal
                        faculties they possess conform to the cessation of the defilements, because
                        they perceive the moment and they never miss the moment. The supernormal
                        faculties they possess are conducive to the forms of penetrating insight
                        that are fixed upon what is transcendent and noble. The supernormal
                        faculties they possess are difficult for the disciples and solitary buddhas
                        to understand. The supernormal faculties they possess have profound meaning
                        and defeat their adversaries, Māra in all his forms. The supernormal
                        faculties they possess produce the essence of awakening and are the most
                        supreme form of awakening, which brings about a perfect realization of all
                        the qualities of a buddha. The supernormal faculties they possess are
                        consistent with the turning of the wheel of Dharma. The supernormal
                        faculties they possess can tame all beings. The supernormal faculties they
                        possess secure empowering authority because they have mastery over all

                        acquired complete and perfect awakening, the Blessed One was dwelling at
                        Deer Park in Sage Landing in Vārāṇasī and turning the wheel of Dharma. At
                        that time, a bodhisattva named Vegadhārin came from a world called
                        Arindamāyā in the buddha domain of the realized one Campakavarṇa, in the
                        eastern direction. He came to this Sahā world in order to see, venerate, and
                        serve the Blessed One. He bowed his head at the feet of the Blessed One,
                        walked around him seven times, keeping him on the right, and sat down before
                        the Blessed One.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-424"> The number

                            agrees with the Sanskrit that he circles the Buddha Padmaśrīrājagarbha
                            seven times.</note> Then, through the majestic power of the Buddha, the
                        following thought occurred to the bodhisattva Vegadhārin: ‘Even though it is
                        impossible to look down at the top of the head of blessed buddhas and their
                        bodies are immeasurable and limitless, I would like to try and determine the

                        the body of the Realized One and saw that it was six million eight hundred
                        thousand leagues tall. He had the thought, ‘I have acquired the supernormal
                        faculties and made child’s play of the foundations for superhuman power. I
                        would like to try and determine the measure of the Realized One’s body to an

                        and hard like vajra, but it is soft and pleasant to touch like the down of

                            This passage is also quoted twice in Candrakīrti’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prasannapadā</title>, where it is explicitly said
                            to come from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tathāgataguhya Sūtra</title>.

                            manuscript and the Tibetan translation of this sūtra, but after quoting
                            this sentence, Candrakīrti appears to continue to cite or paraphrase
                            this sūtra. In neither case, however, does there seem to be an exact
                            equivalency to what is found in the extant Sanskrit manuscript or the
                            Tibetan translation. In this respect, it would be interesting to compare
                            the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prasannapadā</title> with the earlier
                            Chinese translation of the sūtra. After the first quotation of the
                            sentence above, Candrakīrti says, “How, then, is the teaching of the
                            Dharma taught by the Blessed One to all the various kinds of folk who
                            are ready to the trained, beginning with gods (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sura</foreign>), asuras, humans

                            siddhas, vidyādharas, and uragas (i.e., nāgas)? With the mere utterance
                            of speech for a single moment, [a speech that is] a great light, reddish
                            like the sun in autumn, a light that removes the darkness from the minds
                            of those beings (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">tatajjanamanastamoharaṇī</foreign>), opens the manifold thickets of
                            the lotuses of their intellects, dries up the oceans and rivers of old
                            age and death, and surpasses the magnitude of the light rays from the
                            seven suns of the fiery conflagration [at the end] of the eon.” Then
                            follows the quotation of the three metaphors in verse from this sūtra
                            for which the references are given when they occur. What follows the
                            second quotation by Candrakīrti of the sentence above is the following:
                            “Moreover, all beings, whose aspirations and constituent <term ref="UT22084-039-003-1506">element</term>s vary, understand the
                            speech that comes from the Realized One variously in accordance with
                            their level of dedication. And each and every one of them has the
                            thought, ‘The Blessed One is teaching this Dharma to us; we are hearing
                            the Realized One’s teaching of the Dharma.’ In this regard, the Realized
                            One does not form an idea; he does not form a concept. For, indeed,
                            Śāntamati, the Realized One is devoid of all vain imaginings or
                            lingering traces of the web of thoughts and concepts.” This second
                            passage seems quite similar to parts of the passage that follows this
                            one in the main text and part of a passage found a few paragraphs
                            further below in the sūtra. After what was just translated, the second
                            quotation in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prasannapadā</title> continues
                            with a verse and several more lines that pursue a similar theme, at the
                            end of which Candrakīrti says, “All of this has been explained at length
                            in ‘The Chapter on the Secret of the Speech of the Realized One’
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">tathāgata­vāgguhya­parivarta</foreign>).” The main statement above

                        cause of this? It is because, Śāntamati, a realized one is in a continuous

                        breathe out. He does not begin any thought process or continue any thought
                        process, and no speech emerges from what does not begin or continue any
                        thought process. So, a realized one does not begin any thought process or
                        continue any thought process or form any idea. He does not form any concept.
                        He does not speak anything, he does not articulate anything, he does not
                        pronounce anything; and yet, beings have the thought, ‘The Realized One is
                        speaking.’</p>

                        even an eon would not suffice to describe the conduct of those beings
                        engaged in lustful behavior. An eon would not suffice to describe the

                        the Realized One’s speech comes out of his mouth. Instead, they know that it
                        issues from space. Śāntamati, even though it is the case that some beings
                        believe that the Realized One’s speech comes out of his mouth, this is not
                        something that ought to be apparent to you. Why not? Śāntamati, there are

                        Some believe it issues from the shoulders, while some believe it issues from
                        the forehead, or from the eyebrows, or from the tuft of hair between the

                        of a realized one’s speech in accordance with their own aspirations and in
                        accordance with the maturation of their own motivations; nevertheless,
                        Śāntamati, a realized one does not form a concept in this respect and exists
                        in a state of equanimity. Śāntamati, this is analogous to a well-crafted
                        musical instrument, a wind bell, which makes a sweet sound without being
                        touched by a hand, but rather when it is moved by the wind. It does not make
                        any special effort to produce a sound, but still it makes a sweet sound
                        because of the special nature of its previous preparation. In the same way,
                        Śāntamati, a realized one’s speech comes out when it is moved by knowledge
                        of beings’ motivations, but a realized one does not make any special effort
                        in this regard to produce it. Rather, a realized one’s speech conforms to
                        the sense perceptions of all beings because of the special nature of a

                    <p tid="339">“To draw another analogy, Śāntamati, the sound of an echo comes out
                        as a loud report,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-487"> Following
                            the Sanskrit manuscript here, which seems to read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">parivijñaptitā</foreign> and should be
                            emended to <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">parivijñaptito</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Vijñapti</foreign> means “information” or an “announcement,”
                            “request,” or “report.” Here, the English word “report,” used in the
                            sense of the report a firearm makes when it is fired, gives the
                            appropriate sense. The prefix <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pari</foreign>- may suggest the idea that the echo is perceived as
                            producing a “successive” sound, or perhaps that the sound is perceived
                            as coming from “all around,” or perhaps it simply intensifies it—a
                            “loud” report. In any case, the Tibetan translation here, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">gzhan rnam par rig par byed par
                                yang</foreign>, suggests an alternate reading of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">paravijñaptitaḥ</foreign>, which then
                            suggests another possible interpretation that the sound is perceived as
                            coming from “another” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">para</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gzhan</foreign>) direction or from “something (or somewhere) else”
                                (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">para</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gzhan</foreign>), as it sometimes does
                            when one hears a loud noise. In both cases, the analogy appears intended
                            to show that the agency or source of the sound is ambiguous.</note> yet
                        the sound cannot be found inside, or outside, or both inside and outside, or
                        somewhere else. In the same way, Śāntamati, the speech of a realized one
                        comes out as a report of the motivations of all beings,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-488"> The clever play continues here on the

                            of all beings, or it is informative of the motivations of all beings, or

                        bodhisattvas. He was revealing at length a teaching of the Dharma called

                        to measure the Realized One’s sphere of sound.’ So, the elder, Maudgalyāyana
                        the Great, vanished from his seat and reappeared on the summit of Mount
                        Meru, but while he was standing there he still heard the speech of the

                                ba’i bye brag phyed par mtshams sbyor ba</foreign>, perhaps meaning
                            “conducive to thoughts about freedom.” The presence of <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bye brag phyed par</foreign> in the
                            Tibetan translation suggests the Tibetans may have read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">muktamata</foreign>, “thoughts about
                            freedom,” instead of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">muktavatā</foreign>, “a place characterized by freedom.” Also, it
                            is interesting to note that the Tibetan here translates the term
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anusandhi</foreign>,
                            “conforming or conducive to,” with the term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mtshams sbyor</foreign>, whereas earlier in the same
                            list the Tibetan transliterates the term in its rendering of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">haranusandhi</foreign>, translated
                            above as “what sounds like ‘<distinct>hara!</distinct>’ ” In both cases,
                            we have interpreted the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anusandhi</foreign> to mean that Vajrapāṇi is saying that there is
                            an approximate correspondence between the actual expression in the
                            language of the gods and the way he has rendered it, but this is a
                            somewhat speculative interpretation. Perhaps in both cases the idea
                            behind the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anusandhi</foreign> is closer to the Tibetan translation of the
                            second instance, “what conforms or is conducive to.”</note>

                        of great courage, Śāntamati: “In this regard, Śāntamati, what is the secret
                        of the mind of the realized ones and the purity of their mental action?
                        Śāntamati, let me draw an analogy: Those beings who have been reborn among
                        the classes of gods in the formless realm remain focused upon a single
                        object of consciousness for eighty-four thousand eons. They do not change

                        the same way, Śāntamati, a realized one has a mind that is not fixed on
                        anything, in such a way that from the night when the bodhisattva awakens to
                        unsurpassable and perfect awakening until the night when the Realized One
                        passes into complete cessation, the state of cessation that is free of any

                            something rather different here: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">rnam par grol ba’i thabs brnyes pa</foreign>, “he has acquired
                            skill in the method of liberation.”</note> He is the king whose mighty
                        banner gives off the light of great wisdom. Unstained by the eight worldly
                        concerns, he is the true great lotus. Being one from whom the powerful
                        memory of all the teachings and the formulas that support it have not been
                        stolen, he is the true great ocean. Being unmovable, unshakeable, and devoid
                        of aversion and attachment, he is the true mighty Mount Meru. Completely
                        unblemished, utterly pure, and possessing an intellect that is dazzlingly
                        clear, he is the true priceless gem. Possessing power over all things, he
                        has a mind that is ready for any endeavor.</p>

                        toward the seat of awakening, and, impelled by the gods, he gathered up a
                        bundle of grass that was soft, tender, agreeable, attractive, curved like a
                        peacock’s neck, spiraling nicely to the right, fragrant, and pleasant to
                        touch like the down of the kācalindika bird. He took the bundle of grass,
                        approached the Bodhisattva, and offered it to him with the ambition that he
                        would conceive the aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening.</p>

                        awakening, or that he had done so for the last time, one should not see it
                        in that way. For it was because of the previous vow made by the grass seller
                        Svastika—namely, ‘I will be responsible for spreading out the mats upon the
                        seat of awakening for all the bodhisattvas of this Fortunate Eon.’ Now, what
                        was the cause of this? I know from first-hand experience, Śāntamati, that in
                        the past, ninety-one eons before our Fortunate Eon, a realized one, a worthy
                        one, a perfectly awakened buddha named Vipaśyin arose in the world. He was
                        perfected in knowledge and conduct, a sublime one, a knower of the world, an
                        unsurpassable trainer of those ready to be trained, a teacher of gods and
                        humans, a blessed buddha. </p>

                        aspiration for unsurpassable and perfect awakening, and made this vow: ‘I
                        will prepare the lion’s seat for those realized ones of the Fortunate Eon as

                        Śāntamati, unless the Bodhisattva were to conceal that noise from them.
                        Consequently, the Bodhisattva was seized by a feeling of great compassion at

                        mastery of skill in means. Moreover, Śāntamati, even though he heard the

                        was that? The reason is that he had completely understood that all sounds

                            behind the choices made in the Tibetan translation, since <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’byung ba</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rnam par ’byung ba</foreign> render

                            There are several layers of punning that occur in this paragraph. The
                            first point is simply to note that the term rendered here and below as
                            “accessing,” <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">anupraveśa</foreign>
                            in Sanskrit and translated into Tibetan as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rjes su ’jug pa</foreign>, has the primary sense of
                            entering, and the strong secondary meaning here of understanding. Both
                            meanings are implied here simultaneously. Secondly, in this sentence
                            there seems to be a play on the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">akṣara</foreign>, first in the meaning of what is
                            “imperishable” or “unchangeable” (that is, nirvāṇa), and secondly in the
                            sense of “a syllable” or a written character of a syllabary, what an
                            English speaker would call a letter of the alphabet. This pun seems to
                            have been missed by the Tibetan translation, which translates both uses
                            of the term with <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">yi ge</foreign>
                            (“syllable”), and thus the Tibetan could be translated as “the knowledge
                            that accesses the syllables in the syllables.”</note> Śāntamati, all
                        things have the syllable <distinct>ā</distinct> as their point of
                            entry.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-039-003-1292"> There is a pun

                            which can mean both “aspect,” as it does in the name of this <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhāraṇī</foreign>, and “the syllable
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ā</foreign>.” The Tibetan
                            translation also picks up on this pun and translates here accordingly,
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">a shes bya ba</foreign>.
                            There is also the play again on the two meanings of the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharma</foreign>, “teaching” and

                        is that the awakening of the realized ones is something that arises from the
                        Dharma. Therefore, one should perform worship with the Dharma, and not with

                                <p>The belief in a permanent, substantial,
                                    essentially real individuality or personhood. It is a difficult
                                    expression to translate literally, because the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāya</foreign> is a common
                                    word for the body. The Sanskrit word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kāya</foreign> apparently derives from the verb
                                    root <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ci</foreign> (“to
                                    accumulate”), and this meaning is captured in the Tibetan
                                    translation, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">tshog</foreign>. Sometimes this etymological sense of the
                                    word is drawn out in literary and doctrinal contexts, as it is
                                    in this sūtra. However, the term in this particular context
                                    refers more to the core of the person, and in common
                                    pan-Buddhist usage, as Edgerton points out, it is used in this
                                    expression more or less synonymously with <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ātman</foreign>, the

                                    spreading them. The term derives from the verb <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śru</foreign> (“to hear”), and

                                <p>A common epithet of the buddhas, translated
                                    into Tibetan as “the one gone thus,” from which one gets the
                                    translation “thus-gone one.” The term has a sense of literal
                                    movement, of having “gone” or “come” somewhere, but it also
                                    carries the sense of having “realized” something, in both senses
                                    of having understood it and made it real. In some traditional

                                <p>The son of Ajātaśatru according to the
                                    Tibetan translation of this sūtra. Unfortunately, the
                                    corresponding Sanskrit of this portion of the text is not
                                    extant. In Pāli Buddhist literature, Ajātaśatru’s son is named
                                    Udāyibhadda, which does not seem to correspond well to this
                                    Tibetan translation. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Lalitavistara</title>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’jigs
                                        byed</foreign> is attested for the name Bhayaṃkara, but
                                    there it refers to one of attendants of Māra. It is also
                                    attested as a translation for Bhairava in some Buddhist texts.
                                    It is common for <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sbyin</foreign> to
                                    translate the form <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">datta</foreign>,
                                    which is a common ending in names. Taken together here this
                                    gives us Bhairavadatta or Bhayaṃkaradatta. The former is an
                                    attested name in India, but it is too tenuous to use it
                                    here.</p>

                                    The manuscript of the sūtra contains the variant spelling
