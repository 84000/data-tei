                    <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of the Nāga King Sāgara</title> presents a discourse given by the Buddha
          Śākyamuni on the importance of considering the effects caused by actions. At the start of his teaching, the Buddha remarks how
          the variety of forms that exist, and in fact all phenomena, come about as the result of virtuous and nonvirtuous
          actions. By understanding this law of cause and effect and by taking great care to engage in virtue, one will avoid
          rebirth in the lower realms and enter the path to perfect awakening. In the rest of his discourse he explains in 
          great detail the advantages of engaging in each of the ten virtues and the problems associated with
          not engaging in them.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of the Nāga King Sāgara</title> takes place in the unusual setting of the
            nāga king Sāgara’s court deep in the ocean. Here the Buddha gives a discourse on the importance of avoiding the ten
            nonvirtuous deeds. The sūtra begins with the Buddha Śākyamuni explaining how everything, including all the various
            life forms of beings in the ocean and even the awakening of a buddha, is created through the law of cause and effect.
            The Buddha explains the relationship between form and emptiness, showing how despite the essential emptiness of all
            phenomena, beings appear in various shapes and sizes due to their former virtuous and nonvirtuous actions. The
            remainder of the text concerns the ten nonvirtuous acts and the need to abandon them by practising instead
            the ten virtuous acts. First, the Buddha explains the various benefits of abstaining from each of the nonvirtuous
            acts and shows how this will lead to awakening. He then describes the perilous consequences of engaging in the
            nonvirtuous acts. Finally, the Buddha explains how cultivating additional positive qualities while engaging in these
            virtuous acts will lead to even greater spiritual boons. </p>

          <p tid="9">The Degé Kangyur contains three sūtras entitled <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of the Nāga King
              Sāgara</title>. They can be distinguished by their length, one being quite long (Toh 153, 164 folio
            pages)<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh153.html"/>, one medium-length, which is
            translated here (Toh 154, 14 folio pages), and one very short (<ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh155.html">Toh 155</ref>, 1 folio page). All three of these are included
            as individual texts in the early ninth century Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) catalog,
            confirming their status as independent scriptures in Tibet during the imperial period.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-5"> See Denkarma: 297.a.6<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4364.html" inst="297.a"/> (Toh 153),

              Herrmann-Pfandt 2008: Toh 153 = no. 96 (p. 55), Toh 154 = no. 187 (p. 100), Toh 155 = no. 237 (p. 125). </note> Of
            these, Toh 155 appears to be unrelated to the other two. It seems apparent, however, that at some point in its textual
            life (presumably in India), Toh 154 was taken as an excerpt from Toh 153 and transmitted as an independent text. A large 
            number of minor differences and one whole section that is unique to 
            Toh 154<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-6"> Toh 154 contains a section of nearly two folios that is not included in Toh

            two versions, but their shared provenance is nevertheless clear. </p>

          <p tid="10">A further indication that the two texts had already circulated independently in India is that the two sūtras
            were translated into Tibetan by different translation teams. Toh 153 was translated by Jinamitra, Prajñāvarma, and
            Yeshé Dé while Toh 154 was translated by Jinamitra, Dānaśīla, Munivarman, and Yeshé Dé. Interestingly, in two versions
            of the colophon to Toh 154 it is explicitly mentioned that this text is an extract from a larger scripture, although
            Toh 153 is not specified as the source.<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-8"> These two colophons are
              those of the Stok Palace and Shey Palace, which both belong to the Thempangma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">thems
                spang ma</foreign>) group of Kangyurs. S, Z: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">mdo che ba’i nang nas bkod pa

          <p tid="11">Both texts were transmitted from India to China, with the longer of the two (Toh 153) appearing four hundred
            years before the shorter. Toh 154 was translated into Chinese twice under two different titles (Taishō 600 and 601).
            Taishō 600 is a translation made between 695 and 700 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> by the Khotanese monk Śikṣānanda (652–710
              <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>) and appears under the title <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra on the Path of the Ten
                Virtuous Actions</title>.<note place="end" index="4" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-10"> Chinese: <title xml:lang="zh">十善業道經</title> (<title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Shishan ye dao jing</title>). 
                This text has been translated into English from the Chinese at least three times: Saddhaloka 1996;
              Rulu 2012; and Wong, n.d.</note> Taishō 601 is a translation made relatively late, between 980 and 1017 
            <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, by Dānapāla (d. 1017 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>), a monk
            from the area of Uḍḍiyāna in northwestern India who was one of the four chief Indian translators during the Song
            dynasty; its title matches the Tibetan and Sanskrit title here.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-115" index="0">Chinese:

                jing</title>).</note> Given this information, we can surmise that Toh 154 was circulating as an independent text in India prior to
            695 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi> and that its subsequent transmission to both China and Tibet was also independent from Toh 153. It is
            difficult, however, to determine exactly when the split occurred. </p>

          <p tid="20">Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing within the ocean in the realm of the nāga king
            Sāgara. He was in the courtyard of the nāga king Sāgara together with a great monastic saṅgha of eight thousand monks
            and an assembly of bodhisattva great beings who had assembled from the worlds of the ten directions, a vast number of
            whom had attained supernatural knowledge. Also present there were Śakra, Brahmā, and the guardians of the world, and
            many trillions of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-17"/>
          <p tid="21">Then the Blessed One, knowing the assembly in its entirety, spoke to the nāga king Sāgara, “Lord of nāgas,
            alas! The state of this world has been shaped by various kinds of karma. The predispositions to various kinds of karma
            are in turn conditioned by a variety of mental apprehensions. <ref cRef="F.198.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-117"/> This is also what
            causes the variety of beings.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-18"/>
          <p tid="22">“Lord of nāgas, consider all the various forms of the beings that are present here in this retinue and in
            this ocean as well—all the diversity of beings that exist here. Lord of nāgas, all these beings are here in such
            variety due to the variety of their previous engagement in virtue and nonvirtue through activities of mind, body,
            speech, and intellect. The mind is formless, invisible, and ungraspable. In the same way, lord of nāgas, because all
            these forms of beings are fabrications, their present characteristics have no owner, no ownership, and are
            ungraspable. Being simply a variety of productions formed by whatever karma has been accumulated, they have no creator
            whatsoever.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-19"/>
          <p tid="23">“Lord of nāgas, in this way, all phenomena are inconceivable and have the essential quality of being
            illusory. Lord of nāgas, since bodhisattvas are skilled in this regard, they understand that any phenomenon only comes
            to exist by virtue of being constructed. Knowing this, they therefore engage in virtue. Then, because phenomena are
            constructed, when such virtuous actions are performed, the resultant aggregates, elements, and sense sources are
            elegant, lovely to behold, and beautiful. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-003-20"/>
          <p tid="24">“Lord of nāgas, the body of a thus-gone one is born from merits numbering in the trillions. This body, which
            is adorned with marks, perfectly complete, and splendorous, outshines the worlds of gods and humans and prevails
            uninterruptedly. Consider how even the great brahmā gods, who hold dominion over one million worlds, appear faded, and
