          <p tid="119">This text, which appears in both the Degé Kangyur and Tengyur under the alternative titles <title xml:lang="en">Praising the Lady Who Rules
            Disease</title> (Toh 1090) and <title xml:lang="en">Eight Verses Praising Śrīdevī Mahākālī</title> (Toh 1777), is a short praise to the goddess
            known as Śrīdevī Mahākālī. According to <title xml:lang="en">The Tantra of the Flaming Ḍākinī</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mkha’ ’gro ma me lce
              ’bar ba’i rgyud</title>, Toh 842)<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh842.html"/>, which recounts the origin story of this goddess and her attendant (and half-sister)
            Rematī, the two are protectors of the Dharma who have taken vows to guard the followers of the Buddha’s teaching.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-219"> The two
              goddesses are half-sisters, since Mahādeva is the father of both of them.</note> Within the Kangyur, the praise is part of a group of small group
            of texts concerned with Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Rematī.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-220"> The texts belonging to this group are Toh 670<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh670.html"/>, Toh
              671<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh671.html"/>, Toh 672<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh672.html"/>, Toh 840<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh840.html"/>, Toh 842<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh842.html"/>, and Toh
              1090/1777. While a detailed analysis of the provenance of this group of texts is beyond the scope of this introduction, we may briefly note that
              none of these works has a translator’s colophon. Therefore, their status as translated texts from Sanskrit cannot be verified. Indeed, this group
              of texts devoted to Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Rematī likely first began to circulate not in India but rather in late eighth- or early ninth-century
              Tibet, where they appeared at the nexus of Indian and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, a point of intersection where Indic figures, narratives, and
              iconography found new expressions within the unfolding Tibetan Buddhist idiom. In addition to the texts in this grouping, there are other Kangyur
              texts, such as Toh 458<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh458.html"/>, Toh 746<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh746.html"/>, and Toh 1091<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh1091.html"/>, in which the name
              Revatī (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign>) appears and, in one instance (Toh 458<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh458.html"/>) the name Rematī is also
              found. However, these instances all refer to a rākṣasī demoness named Revatī and not the protector Rematī, who appears in the above group of texts
              (this point is also discussed in more detail elsewhere in this introduction).</note> The praise appears to have been included in the Tengyur based
            on an assumption that it was authored by a historical person, the brahmin Vararuci. However, this authorial attribution seems to be incorrect and
            was likely caused by the text’s rather confusing pedigree (see more below).</p>

          <p tid="120">As for Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Rematī, in <title xml:lang="en">The Tantra of the Flaming Ḍākinī</title> (Toh 842) we find an elaborate origin story
            for these two goddesses.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-222"> The origin account of the two protectors is found in Toh 842 (vol. 99 [rnying rgyud, ga], folios

              (1949, pp. 218–19) and later by Amy Heller (1997, pp. 286–90).</note> In this tantra both Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Rematī form the aspiration to
            jointly protect the Dharma in the future—continuing in their respective roles as “the Lady” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">jo mo</foreign>)
            and “the Servant” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khol mo</foreign>). Central to their activity as Dharma protectors is the bodhisattva
            Vajrapāṇi, who blesses Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Rematī at several crucial junctures in their lives and finally, following their conversion to the
            Buddha’s teaching, confers on them extensive empowerments and instructions so that he becomes their main spiritual teacher. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-223"/>
          <p tid="121">A common series of epithets used in the Kangyur texts for Śrīdevī Mahākālī (and occasionally Rematī as well) is “Yama’s Sister” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gshin rje’i lcam mo</foreign>), “Wife of the Demon” (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bdud kyi yum</foreign>),

            for these epithets is explained in <title xml:lang="en">The Tantra of the Flaming Ḍākinī</title>, where they all refer to events in the first of
            Śrīdevī Mahākālī’s past lives. According to this tantra, Śrīdevī Mahākālī was originally born as a divine girl called Red Cāmuṇḍī. Her father was
            Mahādeva, her mother was Umadevī, and her brother at that time was called Yama Mahākāla. Hence, she is “Yama’s Sister.” At some point Red Cāmuṇḍī
            rescues a nāga from the attack of a garuḍa and subsequently gains fame under the name White Conch Protectress (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar mo
              dung skyong ma</foreign>). Unfortunately, she is soon thereafter tricked into marriage with the rākṣasa king Daśagrīva and so becomes “Wife of the
            Demon.” Later, White Conch Protectress (together with Rematī) flees his kingdom and, once free, prays that in her next life she may meet the Buddha
            and become the sovereign goddess of the desire realm. This aspiration is eventually fulfilled when White Conch Protectress and Rematī (now in a
            subsequent lifetime) encounter the Dharma protector Ekajaṭī and receive from her the names Black Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Yakṣa Rematī,
            respectively.</p>

          <p tid="122">Interestingly, although these epithets are all related to a specific past life of Śrīdevī Mahākālī, in the related Kangyur texts they are also at
            times used in reference to Rematī. In fact, even though <title xml:lang="en">The Tantra of the Flaming Ḍākinī</title> clearly presents Śrīdevī
            Mahākālī and Rematī as two distinct individuals, it seems at times in the Kangyur literature as if their names and epithets are used almost
            interchangeably, in reference to both—almost as if the two protectors at times share the same identity. An example of this is found in the tantra
            <title xml:lang="en">Verses Praising Śrīdevī Kālī</title> (Toh 671) where Śrīdevī Mahākālī is praised as “Sovereign Goddess of the Desire Realm,

          <p tid="123">In India, the epithet Śrīdevī (Glorious Goddess) is broadly applied to a range of peaceful and wrathful goddesses, but in Tibet the name is mostly
            identified with the wrathful Dharma protector Palden Lhamo (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpal ldan lha mo</foreign>; Palden Lhamo being the Tibetan
            translation of the Sanskrit Śrīdevī), who, just like Śrīdevī in India, also appears in several manifestations.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-227"> For early
              discussions of Palden Lhamo, see Tucci 1949 (pp. 590–92) and Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956 (pp. 22–37). For a more recent overview of Palden Lhamo, see
              Heller 2005 (pp. 217–20).</note> In the Kangyur, however, the appearance of Śrīdevī Mahākālī, as well as that of Rematī, is always nearly
            identical.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-228"> It should also be noted that Śrīdevī Mahākālī, as she appears in these Kangyur texts (see <ptr target="#UT22084-101-146-220"/>), is not necessarily identical with the non-Buddhist goddess Kālī, although the two
              goddesses draw on shared mythological themes.</note> Their iconography is described primarily in the tantra called <title xml:lang="en">The Verses
                Praising Śrīdevī Kālī</title> (Toh 671) and in <title xml:lang="en">Praising the Lady Who Rules Disease</title> (Toh 1090), and the reasons behind
            many of their characteristic features are described in <title xml:lang="en">The Tantra of the Flaming Ḍākinī</title> (Toh 842). In these works, both
            goddesses are described as black in color, riding a donkey, wearing shackles as adornments, and holding a skull and a sword.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-229"> In

            fresh skulls. Besides such traditional wrathful ornaments, both goddesses also keep a lion and a snake as ear ornaments, while the sun adorns their
            navels. To readers familiar with the iconography of Śrīdevī / Palden Lhamo in the Tibetan traditions, the many similarities are clear. However, it
            should be kept in mind that Śrīdevī / Palden Lhamo has several distinct manifestations in Tibet, so not all the features of Śrīdevī Mahākālī and
            Rematī apply to all manifestations of Śrīdevī / Palden Lhamo. </p>

          <p tid="124">As for Rematī, she also appears to have been linked to the similarly named Indian goddess Revatī, but the situation with these two names is
            somewhat complicated. In the Kangyur, the name Rematī (phoneticized as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">re ma ti</foreign>) nearly always references the
            protector Rematī, as she appears in the group of texts centered on this goddess, riding on a donkey and holding her various implements.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-231"> The exceptions to this appear to be Toh 458 and Toh 1091, both discussed below.</note> On the other hand, in non-Buddhist Indian
            literature the name Revatī commonly refers to various other goddesses (e.g., Durgā), who often, but not always, have a wrathful and protective
            nature. However, Revatī is also the name of a rākṣasī who is associated with the illness and mortality of children.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-232">Revatī 
              appears as a rākṣasī with an evil influence on children in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata</title> and elsewhere. On this rākṣasī, see 
              Srinivasan 2020, pp. 104-105 and 134-135. Revatī is also one of the constellations in the heavens, personified as a goddess.
            </note> In Tibetan literature, the name Revatī is most often translated and
            rendered as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign>, which has roughly the same semantic range.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-233"> However, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign> can also refer to a group of local female deities and even a male monastic disciple of the Buddha Śākyamuni
              (in which case <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign> translates the Sanskrit name Revata).</note> Of its various referents, it is the
            rākṣasī demoness Revatī, who in the Kangyur occasionally is linked with the Dharma protector Rematī. </p>

          <p tid="125">Sometimes Revatī (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign>) and Rematī even appear to have been considered identical. For example, the text
            <title xml:lang="en">In Praise of the Goddess Revatī</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lha mo nam gru la bstod pa</title>, Toh 1091) ties the name
            <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign> directly to the name Rematī. However, this text is extracted from the longer text <title xml:lang="en">The Great Tantra of Supreme Knowledge</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rig pa mchog gi rgyud chen po</title>, Toh 746)<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh746.html"/>, in which only the name <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign> is used and the name Rematī does not occur. Moreover, in Toh 1091
            the name Rematī is only found in the opening homage and the concluding colophon—sections of the text that were presumably added after the praise was
            extracted from Toh 746.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-101-146-235"> As discussed in <ptr target="#UT22084-101-146-220"/>, the group of texts in the Kangyur devoted to the protector
              goddesses Śrīdevī Mahākālī and Rematī in the specific forms discussed here appear likely to have first circulated in late eighth- or early
              ninth-century Tibet. This is not the case for texts, like Toh 746 (and the parts that were extracted from this text into the main body of Toh
              1091), that concern the rākṣasī Revatī (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign>). It therefore appears that the use of the name Rematī
              (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">re ma ti</foreign>) as identical to Revatī (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nam gru</foreign>) in a few Kangyur texts,
              such as in the homage and colophon of Toh 1091—and therefore the link between these two otherwise distinct figures—was likely the work of later

            narratives connected with the rākṣasī Revatī are significantly different from those of the protector goddess Rematī, who appears in the Kangyur
            literature with a much more elaborate iconography and a fully developed role as a protector of the Dharma. Whereas Revatī mostly plays a supporting
            role in the tantric literature of the Kangyur as an obstacle maker who needs to be pacified, Rematī plays a much fuller character with a complex

            that the standalone Kangyur and Tengyur recensions of the praise were most likely extracted and adapted at some point from the version of the praise

              databases‍—including the eKangyur that supplies the digital input version displayed by the 84000 Reading Room‍—list this work as being located in
              volume 102. This discrepancy is partly due to the fact that the two volumes of the <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">gzungs ’dus</foreign> section are an
              added supplement not mentioned in the original catalog, and it also hinges on the fact that the compilers of the Tōhoku catalog placed another
              text‍—which forms a whole, very large volume‍—the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vimala­prabhā­nāma­kāla­cakra­tantraṭīkā</title> (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dus ’khor ’grel bshad dri med ’od</title>, Toh 845), before the present volume, numbering it as vol. 100 although it is almost certainly
              intended to come right at the end of the Degé Kangyur as volume 102; indeed its fifth and final chapter is often carried over and wrapped in the
              same volume as the Kangyur <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkar chag</foreign> (catalog). Please note this discrepancy when using the eKangyur viewer

                bsdur ma</foreign>) of the Kangyur and Tengyur, as well as to the recension of the praise found in Toh 671. We have listed some, but not all,
            major differences between Toh 1090/1777 and Toh 671 in the notes to the translation. However, in general we have attempted to translate Toh
            1090/1777 as an independent text without incorporating the many different readings in Toh 671. </p>
