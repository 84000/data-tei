                                        his life. He foresees his rebirth as a pig and calls out to
                                        the Buddha to save him. The Buddha prompts him to seek
                                        refuge in the Three Jewels and, as a result, the god finds
                                        himself reborn into a wealthy family in Vaiśālī. In this
                                        life as a child named Jñānaka, he encounters the Buddha once
                                        more and invites him and his monks for a midday meal. The
                                        Buddha prophesies to Ānanda that the meritorious offering
                                        made by Jñānaka will eventually lead the child to awaken as
                                        the buddha known as King of Foremost Knowing.</p>

                                                beginning with a god in the Heaven of the
                                                Thirty-Three. This god has reached the end of his
                                                life and foresees his rebirth in the womb of a pig
                                                in Vaiśālī, the Licchavi capital at the time of the
                                                Buddha. Another god overhears his cries of agony and
                                                encourages him to call upon the Buddha, who is
                                                staying in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to give
                                                teachings to his mother, who had passed away not
                                                long after his birth. The Buddha prompts the dying
                                                god to seek refuge in the Three Jewels, and, instead
                                                of being reborn to the sow, the god finds himself
                                                born into a merchant family in Vaiśālī. Immediately
                                                after his birth, he praises the Three Jewels,
                                                leading his astounded parents to name him Jñānaka,
                                                “knowledgeable.” At the age of eight, Jñānaka
                                                encounters the Buddha on an alms round. Recollecting
                                                his past life, he offers alms to the Buddha and
                                                invites him and his monks to a midday meal at his
                                                parents’ home. Jñānaka’s parents make elaborate
                                                preparations to receive the Buddha and his monks,

                                                to prevent such an unwelcome event. In this sūtra,
                                                the gods do not take rebirth in the human realm as
