                                                Tibetan translations. Two of the Tibetan translations were made from the Chinese, and one was made
                                                from the Sanskrit. In terms of their content, these six surviving Chinese and Tibetan versions fall
                                                into two main groups: the shorter versions that consist of the Buddha’s teaching to his younger
                                                half-brother Nanda on the subject of conception, gestation, and childbirth; and the longer versions
                                                that also provide a frame narrative explaining that the teaching was given because Nanda, infatuated
                                                with his wife, had been reluctant to take monk’s vows and needed to be convinced by the Buddha. As
                                                well as adding much material not specifically related to conception, gestation, or childbirth, the
                                                longer versions also contain more detail about conception and the <fix>antarābhava</fix> than the
                                                shorter versions. The present translation is of one of the shorter versions. </p>

                                        <p tid="15">There are two different short versions, represented by two different Chinese translations. The earlier of
                                                these was made in the late third or early fourth century by Dharmarakṣa (Taishō 317) and does not
                                                appear to have been translated into Tibetan. The later of these short-version translations was made in
                                                the early eighth century by Bodhiruci as part of the <fix>Ratnakūṭa</fix> collection, and it is his
                                                Chinese translation (Taishō 310–13) that was the source for the ninth-century translation into Tibetan
                                                as part of the Tibetan <fix>Ratnakūṭa</fix>—the text (Toh 58) translated here. </p>

                                        <p tid="16">There are also two different long versions. One was translated into Chinese in the early eighth century by
                                                Yijing as part of his translation of the Chinese <fix>Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya</fix> (Taishō 1451).
                                                According to the Chinese catalog, <fix>Kaiyuan shijiao lu</fix> (Taishō 2154.585c15–19), Bodhiruci
                                                inserted Yijing’s translation from the <fix>Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya</fix> into the Chinese
                                                        <fix>Ratnakūta</fix> collection (Taishō 310–14). This translation was, in turn, the source for
                                                the translation in the Tibetan <fix>Ratnakūṭa</fix> (Toh 57), the text immediately preceding the
                                                present one in the Kangyur. The second long version does not exist in Chinese and is not an
                                                independent sūtra but is found embedded, like many other passages that may originally have also
                                                circulated independently, in the <fix>Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya</fix>, specifically in the
                                                        <fix>Kṣudrakavastu</fix> (Toh 6). The Tibetan of the <fix>Kṣudrakavastu</fix> was translated
                                                directly from the Sanskrit in the ninth century, and the passage within it that contains this teaching
                                                therefore differs somewhat from the corresponding passage in Yijing’s translation in the Chinese
                                                        <fix>Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya</fix> (Taishō 1451).</p>

                                        <p tid="17">To reiterate, then, there is one Chinese translation of one of the two short versions of the text, one
                                                Chinese translation of the second short version, and one Chinese translation of the first long
                                                version. With respect to the Tibetan translations in the Kangyur, there are also three versions of the
                                                text: the long and short versions in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnakūṭa <fix>(Toh 57 and 58), both

                        </title> was translated directly from
                                                Sanskrit instead of Chinese. The details of this group of texts and their rather complex relationships
                                                are set out in a table at the end of this introduction.</p>

                                        <p tid="18">The present text, <fix>mngal du ’jug pa</fix> (Toh 58), therefore, like the other Tibetan Ratnakūṭa
                                                version, <fix>mngal na gnas pa</fix> (Toh 57), was translated into Tibetan from Chinese. However,
                                                there are further complications. Early in the transmission of these texts to Tibet, as seen in the
                                                early ninth century Denkarma text inventory,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-041-003-18"> See <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">Denkarma</title> F.296.a and Hermann-Pfandt pp. 24–25. The other early inventory, the

                                                        part of the Ratnakūṭa, nor distinguishes them by length; see Phangthangma p. 48.</note> as
                                                well as in the list compiled by Butön prior to the appearance of the first Kangyurs, the Tibetan
                                                titles of the two texts seem to have been switched by comparison with the Chinese: the shorter text
                                                with the Tibetan title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mngal du ’jug pa</title>, “Entry into the Womb,”
                                                corresponds to the longer Chinese text (Taishō 310 [13]) with the title <title xml:lang="Input Language">Chutai hui 處胎會</title>, “Scripture on Dwelling in the Womb.” The
                                                longer text with the Tibetan title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mngal du gnas pa</title>, “Dwelling in the
                                                Womb,” corresponds to the shorter Chinese text (Taishō 310 [14]) with the title <title xml:lang="Input Language">Rutai jing 入胎經</title>, “Sūtra on Entry into the Womb.” The Denkarma
                                                and Butön, whose lists of Ratnakūṭa texts both follow the order of the Chinese Ratnakūṭa closely in
                                                other respects, both differ from it in listing the longer of these texts before the shorter.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-041-003-19"> See Butön F.147.a. Chomden Rigpai Raltri’s <fix>dkar chag</fix> (q.v. F.9.a) has

                                                in hell, which is difficult to compare to anything? What wise person would yearn for such a body in

                                                to turn over because its arms and legs become intertwined; and it will die in its mother’s womb on
                                                account of its sinful, nonvirtuous karma. And at that time, the mother, too, will experience great
                                                suffering or die. If, in previous lives, it engaged in virtuous actions, and accumulated the causes
