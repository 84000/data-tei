                    contains explanations of Buddhist views on the nature of life and death, and a
                    number of philosophical arguments against non-Buddhist conceptions, notably some
                    based broadly on the Vedas. The sūtra is set in the town of Kapilavastu at the
                    time of the funeral of a young man of the Śākya clan. King Śuddhodana wonders
                    about the validity of the ritual offerings being made for the deceased by the
                    family and asks the Buddha seven questions about current beliefs on death and
                    the afterlife. The Buddha answers each of the questions in turn. After two
                    interlocutors interrupt to test the Buddha’s omniscience, the discourse
                    continues to present the Buddhist account of death and reincarnation through a
                    complex array of similes.</p>

                        dialogue between the Buddha and his father, King Śuddhodana. King Śuddhodana
                        observes the brahmanical funeral rites for a fellow member of the Śākya clan

                        pertinent questions: (1) Are beings consistently reborn as their own kind,
                        with humans being reborn as humans and so on? (2) Do beings become utterly
                        nonexistent after death? (3) Do beings, after their death, accompany their
                        dead ancestors and relatives in a <distinct>world of Death</distinct>? (4)
                        Is wealth and poverty consistent from life to life? Do the wealthy continue
                        to be wealthy and the poor to be poor? (5) Is enjoyment of clothes, mounts,
                        and so on consistent from life to life? Do people continue to have the same
                        clothes, horses, and so forth? (6) Can one dedicate food and other offerings
                        to the deceased and thus assure their perpetual welfare and nourishment? (7)
                        Do the dead show themselves to their relatives just as they were when
                        alive?</p>

                    <p tid="4">To these seven questions, the Buddha’s answer is always “no.” Several
                        beliefs that must have been current in India at that time are thus taken up
                        and criticized, beginning with simple skepticism that anything can survive
                        after death at all. The main position being examined, however, seems to be
                        that the deceased survive in an afterlife which is essentially a
                        continuation of the present one, in the company of the same friends,
                        relatives, ancestors, and possessions. The deceased are sustained by the
                        offerings dedicated to them by their living relatives; they remain forever
                        in the <distinct>world of Death</distinct>, not taking rebirth and future

                    <p tid="5">This is a broadly Vedic eschatology, a conception of death and the
                        afterlife that goes well back to the first millennium <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi>, in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ṛgveda</title>, especially in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Atharvaveda</title>, as well as in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Brāhmanas</title>. When the sūtra says that the
                        deceased is “befriended by his ancestors” after death, this is no doubt a
                        reference to the Vedic idea that the dead person transitions to the realm of
                        his ancestors, or his <distinct>fathers</distinct> (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pitṛ</foreign>). Also the dead person
                        comes to be in the presence of a lineage of ancestors all the way back to an
                            <distinct>original ancestor</distinct> (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mes po dang po</foreign>), what seems an allusion to the
                        idea of the pitṛ as including first ancestors, the founders of the human
                            race.<note place="end" index="3" xml:id="UT22084-072-008-8">Note that

                            places the sūtra clearly uses it to mean “ancestor.” It is attested in
                            the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title> 3880 and in other
                            glossaries as the equivalent of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pitāmaha</foreign> (paternal grandfathers), which can also mean

                                <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Āpastamba</title>’s list does not, however,
                            seem to match the offerings of the family of Nandaja, viz., “horses,

                        the afterlife, rebirth as well as the closely related theories of karma and

                        generally play no (or at most obscure) roles; significantly, the sūtra
                        states that rebirth does not figure at all in the afterlife as it is
                        imagined by the mourners of Nandaja.<note place="end" index="5" xml:id="UT22084-072-008-11">Cf. <ptr target="#UT22084-072-008-139">Renou

                        the dead are not simply categorically dismissed as pointless. We find, for
                        example, the following passage allowing a nuanced acceptance:</p>
                    <q>
                        <p tid="8">The Great King then asked: “Blessed One, if this is the case,
                            then is it useless to offer a deceased individual the food, drink,
                            mounts, clothes, and ornaments that were beneficial to him in the
                            present world?”</p>
                        <p tid="9">The Blessed One replied, “O Great King, take the case where a
                            deceased person is being reborn in one of various different states of
                            being because actions he had done are ripening. And suppose people help
                            him by dedicating to him all sorts of virtuous actions that will
                            constitute a collection of merit without any non-virtue. In that case,
                            the person will also be reborn in higher states or attain liberation. On
                            the other hand, when someone has already taken rebirth, then if one aids
                            him through [dedication of] a virtuous action that constitutes merit,
                            that will aid the already reborn person to gain wealth, have good crops,
                            more and more of the pleasures he wishes, as well as honor and respect
                            from all his other fellow beings. However, it is not so that the

                            (2013)</ptr> pp. 86–99 shows, there are passages in texts like the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Aṅguttara­nikāya</title> that do acknowledge
                        efficacy to brahmanical śrāddha-rites—the approach of Pāli canon texts is
                        typically to rationalize offerings and ancestor worship as a form of
                            <distinct>gifting</distinct>. The present sūtra also seems to follow
                        this broad approach in many respects: gifting leads to merits, which can
                        then be dedicated to the deceased and, <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">qua</foreign> dedicated karmic merit, serve to benefit them. What is
                        being targeted, then, does not seem to be the efficacy of householders’
                        rites to benefit the dead <emph>in any way</emph>, but rather the efficacy
                        of the offerings to nourish eternally the dead in an everlasting realm of
                        ancestors. It is especially <emph>that</emph> conception of the afterlife
                        that is being rejected.</p>

                    <p tid="11">The argumentation against such a Vedic eschatology follows several
                        strategies. Sometimes it invokes the fully developed theory of karma
                        governing reincarnation, the worldview of moral causality and retribution
                        accepted in most post-Vedic Indian thought. For example, wealth, poverty,
                        and the like do not remain constant throughout one’s subsequent lives, as
                        they are karmic results that vary because of the ethical nature of actions
                        in those lives. At other times simple human common sense and observation is
                        invoked: for example, if beings, after their death, supposedly continued on
                        with their relatives and ancestors in a <distinct>world of Death</distinct>,
                        they would be unable to recognize one another, for their usual physical form
                        is obviously destroyed in cremation or in the grave. At still other times
                        the argumentation depends upon the supernatural. For example, dreams and
                        apparitions of the deceased turn out to be due to a very special type of
                        spirit that mimics the appearance of deceased in order to trick the living
                        into making offerings that the spirits can then appropriate.</p>

                    <p tid="12">The sūtra itself hardly attempts to provide a positive proof for
                        rebirth. It is almost exclusively devoted to refutation of what Buddhists
                        take to be wrong conceptions of death and the afterlife. After the Buddha’s
                        extensive refutation of the Vedic views, the renegade Devadatta challenges
                        the Buddha to prove the reliability and superiority of his own
                        understanding—he is asked to identify the different sorts of wood from which
                        various ashes come. The Buddha’s success in this and another test leads his
                        interlocutors to conclude that he has suprasensible knowledge enabling him
                        to directly understand all things, including the process of death and
                        rebirth in all its details. The closest thing to a positive argument for a
                        Buddhist eschatology is thus that its truth is assured by the Buddha’s
                        omniscience. <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">A fortiori</foreign>, one
                        finds no trace of the main Buddhist metaphysical argument for reincarnation,

                            of Āryaśūra and Dharmakīrti alike is that consciousness can only exist
                            when preceded by a previous consciousness; thus the initial

                            occur in a very similar order: this is sufficient to establish a
                            relationship between the two texts. We may therefore conclude that one
                            of the texts is referring to the other. Since the similes are not only
                            listed in the sūtra, but also described at length, and since the similes
                            are only a part of the long sūtra, of which they form a natural
                            component, I suggest that it is Nāgārjuna who has based his verse on the
                            sūtra, and not the composer or editor of the sūtra who has adapted
                            Nāgārjuna’s verse into his text. It is indeed characteristic of
                            Nāgārjuna’s style to give brief paraphrases of canonical passages in his
                            important works, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Madhyamaka-kārikās</title>, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnāvalī</title>, and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Suhṛllekha</title>.” Skilling points out that Sanskrit and Tibetan
                            texts of Nāgārjuna’s verse 5 have the eight analogies in slightly
                            different orders, but that the order in the sūtra is
                                <emph>exactly</emph> the same as that in the Tibetan of verse
                            5.</note> Skilling’s historical point would be important, because it
                        would tell against interpreting Nāgārjuna’s own term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">asaṃkrama</foreign> as somehow indicating
                        an unqualified rejection of transmigration. The sūtra, in its extensive
                        explanations of the eight analogies (see <ptr target="#UT22084-072-008-96">fol. 152.b</ptr> et seq.), makes it clear that “no transmigration” does
                        not mean that there is <emph>no</emph> transmigration or rebirth, but rather
                        that nothing actually transmigrates; there is no transmigration from one
                        life to another of any entity whatsoever, be it permanent or extinguished. </p>

                        the folio numbering in the translation refers to the numbering in the <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sde dge par phud</title> edition. The Peking Kangxi
