                    <title xml:lang="en">Questions Regarding Death and Transmigration</title>
                    contains explanations of Buddhist views on the nature of life and death, and a
                    number of philosophical arguments against non-Buddhist conceptions, notably some
                    based broadly on the Vedas. The sūtra is set in the town of Kapilavastu at the
                    time of the funeral of a young man of the Śākya clan. King Śuddhodana wonders
                    about the validity of the ritual offerings being made for the deceased by the
                    family and asks the Buddha seven questions about current beliefs on death and
                    the afterlife. The Buddha answers each of the questions in turn. After two
                    interlocutors interrupt to test the Buddha’s omniscience, the discourse
                    continues to present the Buddhist account of death and rebirth using a
                    set of eight analogies, each of which complements the others in a detailed explanation.</p>

                        pertinent questions: (1) Are beings consistently reborn as their own kind,
                        with humans being reborn as humans, and so on? (2) Do beings become utterly
                        nonexistent after death? (3) Do beings, after their death, accompany their
                        dead ancestors and relatives in a “world of Death”? (4)
                        Is wealth and poverty consistent from life to life, with the wealthy continuing
                        to be wealthy and the poor to be poor? (5) Is enjoyment of clothes, mounts,
                        and so on consistent from life to life, with people continuing to have the same
                        clothes, horses, and so forth? (6) Can one dedicate food and other offerings
                        to the deceased and thus assure their perpetual welfare and nourishment? (7)
                        Do the dead show themselves to their relatives just as they were when
                        alive?</p>

                    <p tid="4">To each of these seven questions, the Buddha’s answer is always “no.” Several
                        beliefs that must have been current in India at the time are thus taken up
                        and criticized, beginning with simple skepticism that anything can survive
                        after death at all. The main position being examined, however, seems to be
                        that the deceased survive in an afterlife which is essentially a
                        continuation of the present one, in the company of the same friends,
                        relatives, ancestors, and possessions. The deceased are sustained by the
                        offerings dedicated to them by their living relatives; they remain forever
                        in the “world of Death,” not taking rebirth in future

                    <p tid="5">This is a broadly Vedic eschatology, a conception of death and the
                        afterlife that goes well back to the first millennium <hi rend="small-caps">bce</hi>, in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ṛgveda</title>, especially in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Atharvaveda</title>, as well as in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Brāhmaṇas</title>. When the sūtra says that the
                        deceased are “befriended by their ancestors” after death, this is no doubt a
                        reference to the Vedic idea that the dead transition to the realm of
                        their ancestors, or their “fathers” (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pitṛ</foreign>). The dead person
                        also comes to be in the presence of a lineage of ancestors all the way back to an
                            “original ancestor” (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">mes po dang po</foreign>), 
                        which seems to be an allusion to the

                        generally play no (or at most obscure) roles; significantly, the sūtra

                        the dead are not just dismissed categorically as pointless. We find, for
                        example, the following passage allowing a nuanced acceptance:</p>
                    <q>
                        <p tid="8">The Great King then asked, “Blessed One, if that is the case,
                            then is it useless to offer deceased individuals the food, drink,
                            mounts, clothes, and ornaments that were beneficial to them in the

                        <p tid="9">The Blessed One replied, “O Great King, take the case where a
                            deceased person is being reborn in one of various different states of
                            being because actions he had done are ripening. And suppose people help
                            that person by dedicating to him all sorts of virtuous actions that will
                            constitute a collection of merit without any nonvirtue. In that case,
                            the person will be reborn in higher states, or attain liberation. On
                            the other hand, when someone has already taken rebirth, then if one aids
                            him through the dedication of a virtuous action that constitutes merit,
                            that will aid the already reborn person to gain wealth, have good crops,
                            more and more of the pleasures he wishes, as well as honor and respect
                            from all his other fellow beings. However, it is not so that the
                            deceased individual stays on in the ‘world of Death,’
                            without rebirth, and taking on food and drink,

                        brahmanical śrāddha-rites as having some efficacy. The approach of texts in the Pāli Canon is
                        typically to rationalize offerings and ancestor worship as a form of
                            <distinct>gifting</distinct>. The present sūtra also seems to follow
                        this broad approach in many respects: gifting leads to merit, which can
                        then be dedicated to the deceased and, in the capacity of dedicated 
                        karmic merit, serve to benefit them. What is
                        being targeted, then, does not seem to be the efficacy of householders’
                        rites to benefit the dead <emph>in any way</emph>, but rather the efficacy
                        of the offerings to nourish the dead eternally in an everlasting realm of
                        ancestors. It is especially <emph>that</emph> conception of the afterlife
                        that is being rejected.</p>

                    <p tid="11">The argumentation against such a Vedic eschatology follows several
                        strategies. Sometimes it invokes the fully developed theory of karma
                        governing reincarnation, the worldview of moral causality and retribution
                        accepted in most post-Vedic Indian thought. For example, wealth, poverty,
                        and the like do not remain constant throughout one’s subsequent lives, as
                        they are karmic results that vary because of the ethical nature of actions
                        in those lives. At other times simple human common sense and observation is
                        invoked: for example, if beings, after their death, supposedly continued on
                        with their relatives and ancestors in a “world of Death,”
                        they would be unable to recognize one another, for their usual physical form
                        is obviously destroyed in cremation or in the grave. At still other times
                        the argument depends upon the supernatural. For example, dreams and
                        apparitions of the deceased turn out to be due to a very special type of
                        spirit that mimics the appearance of the deceased in order to trick the living
                        into making offerings that the spirits can then appropriate.</p>

                    <p tid="12">The sūtra itself hardly attempts to provide a positive proof for
                        rebirth. It is almost exclusively devoted to refuting what Buddhists
                        take to be wrong conceptions of death and the afterlife. After the Buddha’s
                        extensive refutation of the Vedic views, the renegade Devadatta challenges
                        the Buddha to prove the reliability and superiority of his own
                        understanding—he is asked to identify the different sorts of wood from which
                        various ashes come. The Buddha’s success in this and another test leads his
                        interlocutors to conclude that he has suprasensible knowledge enabling him
                        to directly understand all things, including the process of death and
                        rebirth in all its details. The closest thing to a positive argument for a
                        Buddhist eschatology is thus that its truth is assured by the Buddha’s
                        omniscience. <foreign xml:lang="la" type="term">A fortiori</foreign>, one

                    <p tid="15">Indeed, it may well be, as Skilling opines, that Nāgārjuna’s own
                        verse was based on this sūtra: the eight analogies in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pratītya­samutpāda­hṛdaya­kārikā</title> are the same (and practically
                        in the same order) as those in the sūtra.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-072-008-20">

                            eight similes are not only identical to those of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Pratītya­samutpāda­hṛdaya-kārikā</title>, but also
                            occur in a very similar order: this is sufficient to establish a
                            relationship between the two texts. We may therefore conclude that one
                            of the texts is referring to the other. Since the similes are not only
                            listed in the sūtra, but also described at length, and since the similes
                            are only a part of the long sūtra, of which they form a natural
                            component, I suggest that it is Nāgārjuna who has based his verse on the
                            sūtra, and not the composer or editor of the sūtra who has adapted
                            Nāgārjuna’s verse into his text. It is indeed characteristic of
                            Nāgārjuna’s style to give brief paraphrases of canonical passages in his
                            important works, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Madhyamaka-kārikās</title>, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnāvalī</title>, and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Suhṛllekha</title>.” Skilling points out that Sanskrit and Tibetan
                            texts of Nāgārjuna’s verse 5 have the eight analogies in slightly
                            different orders, but that the order in the sūtra is
                                <emph>exactly</emph> the same as that in the Tibetan of verse
                            5.</note> Skilling’s historical point would be important, because it
                        would tell against interpreting Nāgārjuna’s own term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">asaṃkrama</foreign> as somehow indicating
                        an unqualified rejection of transmigration. The sūtra, in its extensive
                        explanations of the eight analogies (<ptr target="#UT22084-072-008-98"/>–<ptr target="#UT22084-072-008-115"/>), makes it clear that “no transmigration” does
                        not mean that there is <emph>no</emph> transmigration or rebirth, but rather
                        that nothing actually transmigrates; there is no transmigration from one
                        life to another of any entity whatsoever, be it permanent or extinguished. </p>

                        heavily reliant on so-called “ancient linguistic usage” either. No
                        translator is mentioned. This translation was clearly done outside the ninth century institutional

                        attracted notable attention in India, apart from possibly figuring as

                    <p tid="18">This sūtra is significant both philosophically as well as
                        historically, being a reliable witness to relatively early Indian
                        non-Buddhist views concerning death and the Buddhist polemics against them.
                        However, with its often long, convoluted sentences and involved
                        argumentation, the text was manifestly not an easy one for scribes, nor
                        probably for its anonymous Tibetan translators. We have not attempted a
                        critical edition, but have given the most significant variants that underlie
                        our understanding of the text. The Tibetan of the Degé Kangyur was our base text, 
                        and its folio numbers appear in the translation. The versions in the Peking Kangxi,
                        Peking Yongle, Lithang, Narthang, Choné, Urga, and Lhasa Zhol Kangyurs were also consulted via the
                            Comparative Edition (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</title>) of the Kangyur. 
                        The Stok Palace and Shelkar (“London”) manuscript Kangyurs, as

                        Kangyur transmission, provide invaluable alternative
                        readings, especially on the not infrequent occasions where the Comparative Edition has only implausible

                        so from the seed of this life the fruit of the next life comes about. O

                        rises again the following morning, so too one passes from this life and
                        takes rebirth. O Great King, sentient beings would become extinct species if
                        they died without any subsequent rebirth. O Great King, if we take the grass
                        and trees outside too, those that have withered will grow again through the
                        changing of the seasons. Likewise, sentient beings will be reborn and die

                        come about when three conditions are gathered together. When there are
                        teachers, students, and sense faculties, we have recitation and language
                        learning. When there exist butter, wicks, and vessels, we have lamps. When
                        there are bright skies, faces, and mirrors, we have reflections. When there
                        are signets, lumps of clay, and human manual effort, we have impressions and
                        images from stamps. When there are crystals, sunlight, grass, and wood, we
                        get fire. When there are seeds, earth, and moisture, we get sprouts. When
                        there is salt, a previous experience of drinking salty water, and when the
                        word ‘sour’ is pronounced, people then begin to salivate.
                        When someone speaks, when there is no other loud sound, and when there is a
                        nearby mountain, then an echo will occur. These are all analogies showing
                        how sentient beings’ rebirths are not made by external agents, but are produced
                        through the causal conditions of actions and afflictive emotions.</p>

                        bridges the gap between lives. The earlier lamp illustrates this present
                        life; the later lamp illustrates future lives; though the later lamp arose

                        actions one has done in this life. The magnifying glass illustrates how one
                        exists as one type of being and is then reborn as another. The seed
                        illustrates how one does not cease and become nonexistent. The sour taste
                        illustrates how one takes rebirth due to actions one has experienced. The
