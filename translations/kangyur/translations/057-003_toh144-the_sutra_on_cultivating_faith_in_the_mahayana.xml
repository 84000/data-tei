            separate chapter to each. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-6"/>
          <p tid="9">It is noteworthy that Great Skillful Trust asks these questions from a
            beginner’s point of view. At several points the text appeals to those who are still on
            the “level of devoted engagement,” a level that is said to comprise the first two of the
            five paths. These are the path of accumulation and the path of preparation, which
            precede the path of seeing, where one for the first time gains an actual experience of
            the empty nature of phenomena. Throughout the sūtra, the Buddha’s answers are thus
            addressed to the concerns of bodhisattvas who have not yet stepped onto the path of
            seeing and who therefore have not reached the level where nonconceptual insight into the
            nature of reality has arisen. The message of the sūtra is thus relevant to all followers
            of the Great Vehicle who have not yet gained the flawless wisdom that lies at its heart.
            The questions posed by Great Skillful Trust concern the nature and development of an
            inspired faith and confidence that lead to the unfolding of such wisdom. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-7"/>
          <p tid="10">In the first chapter, “The Characteristics of Trust,” the Buddha lists eleven
            attributes that describe the physical and mental state of a bodhisattva who has
            developed trust in the Great Vehicle. Taken together, they ensure that the bodhisattva
            will develop all the qualities of a genuine practitioner of the Great Vehicle, in
            particular the means for gathering the accumulations of merit and wisdom.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-8"/>
          <p tid="11">In the second chapter, “The Birth of Trust,” the Buddha lists eleven ways to
            develop trust in the Great Vehicle, which range from connecting with a spiritual teacher
            to developing renunciation with regard to saṃsāra. By far the largest section of this
            chapter is the Buddha’s discussion of the third method for developing trust in the Great
            Vehicle, that of correctly assimilating the teachings into one’s own being beyond a mere
            intellectual understanding. In this section, the Buddha lists twenty-eight wrong views
            that a bodhisattva may fall prey to, by misunderstanding the teachings due to the
            reifying tendency of conceptual thought, and that may thus impede an actual experience of the
            meaning behind the words. </p>

          <p tid="12">A similar list of twenty-eight wrong views that bodhisattvas may fall into 
            can be found elsewhere in the Buddhist canon, in the

              For an English translation, see Asaṅga (2001),
              pp. 190–92.</note> Although the two lists are far from identical, their main themes
            are nevertheless similar. Both lists summarize various ways in which one might get stuck
            on the words rather than the meaning and as a result develop a nihilistic metaphysical
            view of emptiness that construes it as sheer nonexistence. The text warns that such
            literalistic misinterpretations will prevent one from developing the immense qualities
            of wisdom that constitute the Great Vehicle.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">Cultivating Trust in the Great Vehicle</title> can in
            this way be seen to provide a scriptural basis for the Indian Yogācāra school’s critique
            of perceived nihilistic interpretations of the Madhyamaka view associated with the
            influential Indian Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (ca. second century). 
            Although the Tibetan master Butön Rinchen Drup (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bu ston rin chen grub</foreign>, 1290–1364) noted that the sūtra was adopted by the Yogācāra school, it appears to have had far less impact on Buddhist scholarship than Yogācāra classics such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharma­samuccaya</title>
                        <ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4049.html"/> and <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Yogācārabhūmi</title>.<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4035.html"/>
                        <note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-339">On Butön’s claim, see below <ptr target="#UT22084-057-003-17"/>. A search for plausible variants of the sūtra title in the Kangyur and Tengyur collections resulted in only a single quotation (using the modified title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dad pa rab tu bsgom pa’i mdo</title>): Dharmamitra quotes the work in his <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhisamayālaṃkāra­kārikā­prajñā­pāramitopadeśa­śāstra­ṭīkā</title>

            That said, we can detect in its criticisms of misguided interpretations of Madhyamaka doctrines a strain of polemicism that was famously articulated in such Yogācāra classics.
            Consider, as example, its criticism of the
            central Madhyamaka view of no claim or thesis (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratijñā</foreign>):</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-12"/>
          <q>“The view of no claim occurs when a bodhisattva who has a conceptual view of
            nonexistence thinks, ‘If someone should dispute the lack of existence of all phenomena,
            I will not claim any position for myself. In fact, I will not posit anything myself.’ ”

          <p tid="14">In the third chapter, “The Classifications of Trust,” we find a brief
            discussion that presents a spectrum of different aspects of trust in the Great Vehicle.
            The Buddha lists a number of recollections and practices of the qualities contained
            within the Great Vehicle that each produce a distinctive type of trust. Again, the
            target audience is the novice bodhisattva for whom trust provides a firm basis for
            developing the higher qualities of the bodhisattva path.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-14"/>
          <p tid="15">In the fourth and final chapter of the sūtra, “The Benefits of Trust,” the
            Buddha explains the benefits reaped by a person who develops trust in the Great Vehicle.
            Trust is here presented as the primary factor that allows the practitioner to develop
            all the altruistic qualities associated with compassion and wisdom.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-15"/>
          <p tid="16">At the end of the four main chapters of the sūtra, the Buddha predicts the
            swift attainment of the qualities of awakening for those who adopt this Dharma teaching.
            As the Buddha concludes his discourse, the entire world of gods and humans rejoices.</p>

          <p tid="17">Although <title xml:lang="en">Cultivating Trust in the Great Vehicle</title>

            translation informs us that the translation was produced by the two Indian preceptors
            Jinamitra and Dānaśīla, along with the Tibetan editor-translator Yeshé Dé. These three

          <p tid="24">At that point, many novice bodhisattvas who were dwelling on the level of
            devoted engagement assembled and took their places in the retinue. Then, considering
            those novice bodhisattvas who were dwelling on the level of devoted engagement, the
            Blessed One began to speak: “Noble children, if bodhisattvas possess trust in the Great
            Vehicle that allows them to accomplish the Great Vehicle,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-24"> The phrase “trust in the Great Vehicle that allows them
              to accomplish the Great Vehicle,” which occurs repeatedly in this text, translates the
              Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">theg pa chen po’i phyir theg pa chen
                po la dad pa</foreign>. This is a rather obscure expression that is difficult to
              understand conclusively without Sanskrit attestation. Therefore, our rendering of this
              phrase should be seen as somewhat tentative. The key term to understanding this phrase
              is the Tibetan term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyir</foreign>, which
              typically means “because of,” “on account of,” or “for the sake of.” We have here
              understood this term to indicate that trust in the Great Vehicle is the factor that
              enables bodhisattvas to become successful in its practices. Significantly, in support
              of this interpretation, we also find a single occurrence in the Degé block print
              (folio 9.b.7) where the term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyir</foreign> is
              replaced by <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">slad du</foreign>. This helps us
              narrow down the meaning as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">slad du</foreign>
              has a narrower semantic range that normally is translated “for the sake of” or “on
              account of.” In this way we have arrived at our somewhat interpretive translation,
              which we nevertheless believe carries the intended meaning of this odd phrase.</note>
            it will be very meaningful, have a great result, and confer great benefits. Therefore,

              roots of virtue lead to birth as a universal monarch, a guardian of the world, Śakra,

              the form realm up to the realm of neither notion nor no notion at the peak of

              First, think of this statement: ‘Considering the essence of conditioned phenomena, I
              declare that phenomena do not exist.’ If one becomes attached to the literal meaning
              of that statement, one might insist that the phenomena stemming from pollution and the
              phenomena stemming from purification are just nonexistent. <ref cRef="F.18.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-363"/> Thus, one will apprehend their characteristic to be sheer
              nonexistence. Taking phenomena to bear these characteristics, one will assume the view
              of nonexistence. That is why it is called <distinct>the view of

              it is indeed an extravagant view. That is why it is called <distinct>the view that

              leads one to cling to the views that denigrate conventions, pollution, and reality.
              This is what is meant by ‘views that denigrate conventions, pollution, and

            left undisturbed and calm. Likewise, bodhisattvas who have gained trust in the Great
            Vehicle that allows them to accomplish the Great Vehicle may become attached to many

            trust occurs when a bodhisattva is devoted to the Great Vehicle and practices
            accordingly. Clear trust occurs when the bodhisattva performs the activities of the
            Dharma of the Great Vehicle at all times. Peaceful trust occurs when the bodhisattva is
            free from thoughts of <distinct>I</distinct> and <distinct>mine</distinct>. Such faith

            at the time of the perfect buddha Kāśyapa, right here in Rājagṛha, there lived an

            householder’s property. Since she was tormented by hunger and thirst, she also went to
            where the householder lived. In the courtyard, she saw the Buddha and his assembly of
            monks sitting peacefully as their meals were being offered. As the woman beheld their
            perfect behavior and saw the Buddha sitting so beautifully, surrounded by his followers,
            she exclaimed, ‘Oh, the Blessed One, the perfect Buddha Kāśyapa is so beautiful to
            behold; he has such serene conduct and his followers are so graceful!’ Then, with this
            intense feeling of trust, she passed away. Now, because of this she was born in the

            Its design is limitless and has no boundaries. Its characteristics transcend the three
            realms, and it appears from the supreme roots of virtue that are beyond the world, and
            from powerful cognition and the features of extreme purity. Such is the abode of the
            thus-gone ones, which supports limitless bodhisattvas. It is teeming with boundless

            inaccessible to any demon. Superior to all other structures, it is designed through the

            intelligence, and great realization, it is the vehicle of tranquility and insight
            adorned with limitless masses of the qualities that emerge from great emptiness, absence
            of characteristics, and absence of wishes. The thus-gone ones reside in this great
            palace that sits atop the king of all great lotuses. Noble son, if whoever has an

            will create merit that is impossible to illustrate by any worldly merit or even by the
            merit of the hearers and solitary buddhas that transcends the world. Why is that?
            Because, Ānanda, any worldly merit, no matter how great, is subject to cause and effect.
            As it is subsumed by the truth of suffering and the truth of the origin, it cannot bring
            complete satisfaction. Such results only appear when their causes are exhausted, so such
            merit is impermanent. </p>

            the world is not vast, it has a lesser purpose, and it is eventually exhausted. It is
            not vast because it belongs to and observes the inferior vehicle, thus guiding the mind
            in that direction. It has a lesser purpose because it is concerned with oneself. It is
            eventually exhausted because it dissolves within the field of nirvāṇa free from residual
            aggregates. </p>

            the bodhisattvas brings complete satisfaction, its cause is never exhausted, it is vast,
            it has a great purpose, and it is inexhaustible. Therefore, the merit that arises from
            trust in the Great Vehicle of the bodhisattvas cannot be illustrated by means of either
