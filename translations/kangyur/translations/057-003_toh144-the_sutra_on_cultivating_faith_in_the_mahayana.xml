          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="9">It is noteworthy that Great Skillful Trust asks these questions from a
            beginner’s point of view. At several points the text appeals to those who are still on
            the “level of devoted engagement,” a level that is said to comprise the first two of the
            five paths. These are the path of accumulation and the path of preparation, which
            precede the path of seeing, where one for the first time gains an actual experience of
            the empty nature of phenomena. Throughout the sūtra, the Buddha’s answers are thus
            addressed to the concerns of bodhisattvas who have not yet stepped onto the path of
            seeing and who therefore have not reached the level where nonconceptual insight into the
            nature of reality has arisen. The message of the sūtra is thus relevant to all followers
            of the Great Vehicle who have not yet gained the flawless wisdom that lies at its heart.
            The questions posed by Great Skillful Trust concern the nature and development of an
            inspired faith and confidence that lead to the unfolding of such wisdom. </tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="10">In the first chapter, “The Characteristics of Trust,” the Buddha lists eleven
            attributes that describe the physical and mental state of a bodhisattva who has
            developed trust in the Great Vehicle. Taken together, they ensure that the bodhisattva
            will develop all the qualities of a genuine practitioner of the Great Vehicle, in
            particular the means for gathering the accumulations of merit and wisdom.</tei:p>

          <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="11">In the second chapter, “The Birth of Trust,” the Buddha lists eleven ways to
            develop trust in the Great Vehicle, which range from connecting with a spiritual teacher
            to developing renunciation with regard to saṃsāra. By far the largest section of this
            chapter is the Buddha’s discussion of the third method for developing trust in the Great
            Vehicle, that of correctly assimilating the teachings into one’s own being beyond a mere
            intellectual understanding. In this section, the Buddha lists twenty-eight wrong views
            that a bodhisattva may fall prey to, by misunderstanding the teachings due to the
            reifying tendency of conceptual thought, and that may thus impede an actual experience of the
            meaning behind the words. </tei:p>

            Although the Tibetan master Butön Rinchen Drup (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bu ston rin chen grub</foreign>, 1290–1364) noted that the sūtra was adopted by the Yogācāra school, it appears to have had far less impact on Buddhist scholarship than Yogācāra classics such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharma­samuccaya</title>

            That said, we can detect in its criticisms of misguided interpretations of Madhyamaka doctrines a strain of polemicism that was famously articulated in such Yogācāra classics.

              Unfortunately, we have been unable to consult Matsuda’s article for our work on this

            translation informs us that the translation was produced by the two Indian preceptors
            Jinamitra and Dānaśīla, along with the Tibetan editor-translator Yeshé Dé. These three

            Blessed One began to speak: “Noble children, if bodhisattvas possess trust in the Great
            Vehicle that allows them to accomplish the Great Vehicle,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-24"> The phrase “trust in the Great Vehicle that allows them
              to accomplish the Great Vehicle,” which occurs repeatedly in this text, translates the
              Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">theg pa chen po’i phyir theg pa chen
                po la dad pa</foreign>. This is a rather obscure expression that is difficult to
              understand conclusively without Sanskrit attestation. Therefore, our rendering of this
              phrase should be seen as somewhat tentative. The key term to understanding this phrase
              is the Tibetan term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyir</foreign>, which
              typically means “because of,” “on account of,” or “for the sake of.” We have here
              understood this term to indicate that trust in the Great Vehicle is the factor that
              enables bodhisattvas to become successful in its practices. Significantly, in support
              of this interpretation, we also find a single occurrence in the Degé block print
              (folio 9.b.7) where the term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyir</foreign> is
              replaced by <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">slad du</foreign>. This helps us
              narrow down the meaning as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">slad du</foreign>
              has a narrower semantic range that normally is translated “for the sake of” or “on
              account of.” In this way we have arrived at our somewhat interpretive translation,
              which we nevertheless believe carries the intended meaning of this odd phrase.</note>
            it will be very meaningful, have a great result, and confer great benefits. Therefore,

              to the body and the mind becoming saturated with feelings of happiness. This happiness
              and well-being in turn come from the bodhisattvas’ trust in the Great Vehicle that
              allows them to accomplish the Great Vehicle. The happiness and well-being that are
              connected to the bodhisattvas’ trust satisfy body and mind. <ref cRef="F.9.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-345"/> In that way, they differ from the happiness and well-being that arise
              from the sense pleasures of those who revel in desire. The happiness and well-being
              experienced by beings who live in the form and formless realms similarly do not
              satisfy their bodies and minds. Why is that so? Their happiness and well-being do not
              bring peace. </tei:p>

            <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="38">“Why do they not bring peace? The happiness and well-being that arise from
              sense pleasures and the happiness and well-being of those who revel in desire involve
              as much attachment and anger as pleasure. Therefore, they do not bring peace. They do
              not bring peace because they fluctuate. They do not bring genuine peace because of
              their tendency to doubt and question the truths. They do not bring genuine peace
              because they involve the limitless views that emerge as soon as one apprehends
                <distinct>I</distinct> and <distinct>mine</distinct>. They do not bring genuine
              peace because they are the root of mistaken subsidiary disturbing emotions, as well as
              distraction, excitement, dullness, carelessness, and shamelessness. They do not bring
              genuine peace because they are the root of the various karmic actions of the five
              types of beings. They do not bring genuine peace because they are subsumed within the
              truth of suffering and because they are fleeting. </tei:p>

            <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="39">“Noble son, in this way, the physical and mental well-being that arise from
              the five sense pleasures do not bring genuine peace since they perpetuate the
              continuity of cause and effect related to the pollution of disturbing emotions,
              actions, and rebirth. Therefore, they do not satisfy the body or the mind. You should
              understand that it is not only the happiness and well-being that arise from the sense
              pleasures of those who revel in desire that do not bring genuine peace. Just so, in
              all these many ways, when those who live in the form and formless realms arise from
              the state of equilibrium, that does not bring genuine peace. Since these states of
              equilibrium provide no genuine peace, they satisfy neither body nor mind in the way
              that the Dharma-Vinaya of the noble ones does. <ref cRef="F.9.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-346"/>

            <tei:p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" tid="40">“On the other hand, the well-being that bodhisattvas feel when they have
              trust in the Great Vehicle is free from the disturbances of attachment or anger. It is
              free from any disturbances of elation and dejection. It is free from any disturbances
              caused by doubt and uncertainty with regard to the truths. It is free from any
              disturbances caused by the limitless views that emerge from apprehending
                <distinct>I</distinct> and <distinct>mine</distinct>. It is free from any
              disturbances caused by the mistaken subsidiary disturbing emotions, as well as distraction,
              excitement, dullness, carelessness, and shamelessness. It is free from any
              disturbances caused by performing the various actions of the five types of beings. It
              is free from any disturbances subsumed within the truth of suffering. In this way,
              since it is free from any disturbances within the sequence of cause and effect of the
              pollution of disturbing emotions, actions, and birth, it is genuinely peaceful.
              Since it is genuinely peaceful, it satisfies both the body and mind precisely in the
              way that the Dharma-Vinaya of the noble ones does. This, noble son, is the
              characteristic of saturation with respect to the bodhisattvas’ trust in the Great

              high caste, a beautiful appearance, birth in a wealthy family, a perceptive mind that
              is intelligent and aware, abundant living quarters and servants, long life, fame and

              Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. These
              roots of virtue lead to birth as a universal monarch, a guardian of the world, Śakra,
              Māra, and Brahmā, and they also lead to birth in the realms from the concentrations of
              the form realm up to the realm of neither notion nor no notion at the peak of

              Vehicle that allows them to accomplish the Great Vehicle is the basis for all beings.
              Why is that so? The teaching of the Great Vehicle is distinguished in terms of its
              skillful methods that benefit all beings and bring them happiness. When bodhisattvas
              notice that fact, they develop trust in the Great Vehicle. As the bodhisattvas trust
              the teaching, it causes them to joyfully follow that teaching. In this way, the
              bodhisattvas’ trust in the Great Vehicle that allows them to accomplish the Great

              and begins to benefit all beings, it is unlike the assistance that parents, children,
              lovers, friends, and relatives show. Why is that so? Friends and relatives, such as
              one’s parents, mistake what actually harms their loved ones for being something
              beneficial, while that which is actually helpful is thought to be harmful. Similarly,
              they mistake the unpleasant for the pleasant and the pleasant for the unpleasant. In
              this way, they misunderstand what brings benefit and happiness, thinking that the
              harmful is helpful and the helpful is harmful. <ref cRef="F.13.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-353"/>

              teach the sacred Dharma to all beings, who are like their relatives. In that way,
              since they perceive clearly what is helpful and harmful, they are able to help
              everyone. Likewise, they know precisely what happiness and suffering are. Since they
              know about welfare and happiness without any error, they can achieve what is
              beneficial, avoid all that is harmful, accomplish what brings happiness, and avoid all
              that causes suffering. Therefore, trust in the Great Vehicle of the bodhisattvas is
              the basis for the benefit and happiness of all beings, and as such it is more exalted

            at the time of the perfect buddha Kāśyapa, right here in Rājagṛha, there lived an

            householder’s property. Since she was tormented by hunger and thirst, she also went to
            where the householder lived. In the courtyard, she saw the Buddha and his assembly of
            monks sitting peacefully as their meals were being offered. As the woman beheld their
            perfect behavior and saw the Buddha sitting so beautifully, surrounded by his followers,
            she exclaimed, ‘Oh, the Blessed One, the perfect Buddha Kāśyapa is so beautiful to

            inaccessible to any demon. Superior to all other structures, it is designed through the
            blessings of the thus-gone ones. Leading to liberation through mindfulness,
            intelligence, and great realization, it is the vehicle of tranquility and insight
            adorned with limitless masses of the qualities that emerge from great emptiness, absence
            of characteristics, and absence of wishes. The thus-gone ones reside in this great

            merit of the hearers and solitary buddhas that transcends the world. Why is that?
            Because, Ānanda, any worldly merit, no matter how great, is subject to cause and effect.
            As it is subsumed by the truth of suffering and the truth of the origin, it cannot bring
            complete satisfaction. Such results only appear when their causes are exhausted, so such

            not vast because it belongs to and observes the inferior vehicle, thus guiding the mind
            in that direction. It has a lesser purpose because it is concerned with oneself. It is
