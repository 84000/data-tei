            separate chapter to each. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-6"/>
          <p tid="9">It is noteworthy that Great Skillful Trust asks these questions from a
            beginner’s point of view. At several points the text appeals to those who are still on
            the “level of devoted engagement,” a level that is said to comprise the first two of the
            five paths. These are the path of accumulation and the path of preparation, which
            precede the path of seeing, where one for the first time gains an actual experience of
            the empty nature of phenomena. Throughout the sūtra, the Buddha’s answers are thus
            addressed to the concerns of bodhisattvas who have not yet stepped onto the path of
            seeing and who therefore have not reached the level where nonconceptual insight into the
            nature of reality has arisen. The message of the sūtra is thus relevant to all followers
            of the Great Vehicle who have not yet gained the flawless wisdom that lies at its heart.
            The questions posed by Great Skillful Trust concern the nature and development of an
            inspired faith and confidence that lead to the unfolding of such wisdom. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-7"/>
          <p tid="10">In the first chapter, “The Characteristics of Trust,” the Buddha lists eleven
            attributes that describe the physical and mental state of a bodhisattva who has
            developed trust in the Great Vehicle. Taken together, they ensure that the bodhisattva
            will develop all the qualities of a genuine practitioner of the Great Vehicle, in
            particular the means for gathering the accumulations of merit and wisdom.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-8"/>
          <p tid="11">In the second chapter, “The Birth of Trust,” the Buddha lists eleven ways to
            develop trust in the Great Vehicle, which range from connecting with a spiritual teacher
            to developing renunciation with regard to saṃsāra. By far the largest section of this
            chapter is the Buddha’s discussion of the third method for developing trust in the Great
            Vehicle, that of correctly assimilating the teachings into one’s own being beyond a mere
            intellectual understanding. In this section, the Buddha lists twenty-eight wrong views
            that a bodhisattva may fall prey to by misunderstanding the teachings due to the
            reifying tendency of conceptual thought and that may thus impede an actual experience of the
            meaning behind the words. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-9"/>
          <p tid="12">Elsewhere in the Buddhist canon, we find a similar list of twenty-eight wrong
            views that bodhisattvas may fall into in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharma­samuccaya</title><!--Reference Toh
                                                4049-->
            by Asaṅga, the renowned Yogācāra scholar of fourth century India.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-10"> For an English translation, see Asaṅga (2001),
              pp. 190–92.</note> Although the two lists are far from identical, their main themes
            are nevertheless similar. Both lists summarize various ways in which one might get stuck
            on the words rather than the meaning and as a result develop a nihilistic metaphysical
            view of emptiness that construes it as sheer nonexistence. The text warns that such
            literalistic misinterpretations will prevent one from developing the immense qualities
            of wisdom that constitute the Great Vehicle.</p>

          <p tid="13">
                        <title xml:lang="en">Cultivating Trust in the Great Vehicle</title> can in
            this way be seen to provide a scriptural basis for the Indian Yogācāra school’s critique
            of perceived nihilistic interpretations of the Madhyamaka view associated with the
            influential Indian Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (ca. second century). 
            Although the Tibetan master Butön Rinchen Drup (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bu ston rin chen grub</foreign>, 1290–1364) noted that the sūtra was adopted by the Yogācāra school, it appears to have had far less impact on Buddhist scholarship than Yogācāra classics such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharma­samuccaya</title><!--Reference Toh 4049--> and <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Yogācārabhūmi</title>.<!--Reference Toh 4035-->
                        <note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-339">On Butön’s claim, see below <ptr target="#UT22084-057-003-17"/>. A search for plausible variants of the sūtra title in the Kangyur and Tengyur collections resulted in only a single quotation (using the modified title <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dad pa rab tu bsgom pa’i mdo</title>): Dharmamitra quotes the work in his <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhisamayālaṃkāra­kārikā­prajñā­pāramitopadeśa­śāstra­ṭīkā</title><!--Reference Toh 3796 F.96a7--> D 3796: vol. 87, folios 96.a7–96.b1.</note>   
            That said, we can detect in its criticisms of misguided interpretations of Madhyamaka doctrines a strain of polemicism that was famously articulated in such Yogācāra classics.
            Consider, as example, its criticism of the
            central Madhyamaka view of no claim or thesis (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratijñā</foreign>):</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-12"/>
          <q>“The view of no claim occurs when a bodhisattva who has a conceptual view of
            nonexistence thinks, ‘If someone should dispute the lack of existence of all phenomena,
            I will not claim any position for myself. In fact, I will not posit anything myself.’ ”
            (Chapter 2, view no. 20)</q>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-13"/>
          <p tid="14">In the third chapter, “The Classifications of Trust,” we find a brief
            discussion that presents a spectrum of different aspects of trust in the Great Vehicle.
            The Buddha lists a number of recollections and practices of the qualities contained
            within the Great Vehicle that each produce a distinctive type of trust. Again, the
            target audience is the novice bodhisattva for whom trust provides a firm basis for
            developing the higher qualities of the bodhisattva path.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-14"/>
          <p tid="15">In the fourth and final chapter of the sūtra, “The Benefits of Trust,” the
            Buddha explains the benefits reaped by a person who develops trust in the Great Vehicle.
            Trust is here presented as the primary factor that allows the practitioner to develop
            all the altruistic qualities associated with compassion and wisdom.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-15"/>
          <p tid="16">At the end of the four main chapters of the sūtra, the Buddha predicts the
            swift attainment of the qualities of awakening for those who adopt this Dharma teaching.
            As the Buddha concludes his discourse, the entire world of gods and humans rejoices.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-16"/>
          <p tid="17">Although <title xml:lang="en">Cultivating Trust in the Great Vehicle</title>
            discusses themes and practices central to the Great Vehicle, it has previously received
            very little scholarly attention.<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-17">
              The only mention of this sūtra in English that we are aware of is a brief discussion
              found in Skilling (2000), pp. 323–24. Here, Skilling also mentions that “Kazunobu
              Matsuda has written (in Japanese) about the sūtra with reference to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharma­samuccaya</title><!--Reference Toh
                                                  4049-->
              and <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vyākhyāyukti</title><!--Reference Toh 4061--> in his ‘On

              writings of Bu ston and Blo gros rgyal mtshan,’ in Zuihō Yamaguchi (ed.): <title xml:lang="en">Buddhism and Society in Tibet</title>, Tokyo 1986, pp. 269–89.”
              Unfortunately, we have been unable to consult Matsuda’s article for our work on this
              translation. </note> This translation, which is the first rendering into English, was
            prepared based on the Tibetan translation in the Degé Kangyur in consultation with the
            Comparative Edition (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>) and the
            Stok Palace Kangyur. There is to our knowledge no extant complete Sanskrit version of
            this sūtra, and it was also never translated into Chinese. The colophon to the Tibetan
            translation informs us that the translation was produced by the two Indian scholars
            Jinamitra and Dānaśīla, along with the Tibetan editor-translator Yeshé Dé. These three
            persons were all instrumental figures in the early translation efforts that took place
            in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. The text is also recorded in both the

          <p tid="24">At that point, many novice bodhisattvas who were dwelling on the level of

            those novice bodhisattvas who were dwelling on the level of devoted engagement, the
            Blessed One began to speak: “Noble children, if bodhisattvas possess trust in the Great
            Vehicle that allows them to accomplish the Great Vehicle,<note place="end" index="5" xml:id="UT22084-057-003-24"> The phrase “trust in the Great Vehicle that allows them
              to accomplish the Great Vehicle,” which occurs repeatedly in this text, translates the
              Tibetan <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">theg pa chen po’i phyir theg pa chen
                po la dad pa</foreign>. This is a rather obscure expression that is difficult to
              understand conclusively without Sanskrit attestation. Therefore, our rendering of this
              phrase should be seen as somewhat tentative. The key term to understanding this phrase
              is the Tibetan term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyir</foreign>, which
              typically means “because of,” “on account of,” or “for the sake of.” We have here
              understood this term to indicate that trust in the Great Vehicle is the factor that
              enables bodhisattvas to become successful in its practices. Significantly, in support
              of this interpretation, we also find a single occurrence in the Degé block print
              (folio 9.b.7) where the term <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyir</foreign> is
              replaced by <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">slad du</foreign>. This helps us
              narrow down the meaning as <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">slad du</foreign>
              has a narrower semantic range that normally is translated “for the sake of” or “on
              account of.” In this way we have arrived at our somewhat interpretive translation,
              which we nevertheless believe carries the intended meaning of this odd phrase.</note>
            it will be very meaningful, have a great result, and confer great benefits. Therefore,

However, due to their interest, which is kindled by other bodhisattvas, they are able to become free from the stain of doubt regarding the profound and vast Dharma of the Great Vehicle. In this way, novice bodhisattvas who
              are on the level of devoted engagement may consider the teachings of the profound and

              understand that it is not only the happiness and well-being that arise from the sense
              pleasures of those who revel in desire that do not bring genuine peace. Just so, in
              all these many ways, when those who live in the form and formless realms arise from
              the state of equilibrium, that does not bring genuine peace. Since these states of
              equilibrium provide no genuine peace, they satisfy neither body nor mind in the way
              that the Dharma-Vinaya of the noble ones does. <ref cRef="F.9.b" type="folio"/>

              trust in the Great Vehicle is free from the disturbances of attachment or anger. It is
              free from any disturbances of elation and dejection. It is free from any disturbances
              caused by doubt and uncertainty with regard to the truths. It is free from any

              benefit of all beings. Think of the worldly roots of virtue that lead to birth in a
              high caste, a beautiful appearance, birth in a wealthy family, a perceptive mind that
              is intelligent and aware, abundant living quarters and servants, long life, fame and
              power, birth in a family of rulers that is like a great sāla tree, birth in a family
              of brahmins that is like a great sāla tree, birth in a family of householders that is
              like a great sāla tree, birth in the family of the Four Great Kings, and birth in the
              Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the Yāma Heaven, the Heaven of Joy, the Heaven of
              Delighting in Emanations, and the Heaven of Making Use of Others’ Emanations. These
              roots of virtue lead to birth as a universal monarch, a guardian of the world, Śakra,
              Māra, and Brahmā, and they also lead to birth in the realms from the concentrations of
              the form realm up to the realm of neither notion nor no notion at the peak of
              existence. However, these roots of virtue do not even constitute one percent of the
              roots of virtue that are embraced by merit and wisdom due to the trust in the Great
              Vehicle that allows one to accomplish the Great Vehicle. Nor do they measure one
              thousandth, or even one hundred thousandth of that. In fact, no number, fraction,
              enumeration, comparison, example, or illustration would suffice. </p>

              Why is that so? The teaching of the Great Vehicle is distinguished in terms of its
              skillful methods that benefit all beings and bring them happiness. When bodhisattvas
              notice that fact, they develop trust in the Great Vehicle. As the bodhisattvas trust
              the teaching, it causes them to joyfully follow that teaching. In this way, the

            at the time of the perfect buddha Kāśyapa, right here in Rājagṛha, there lived an
            unfortunate woman who, being a sweeper, was the lowest in the village. One day she heard
            that the Buddha and his assembly of monks had been requested to visit a certain
            householder’s property. Since she was tormented by hunger and thirst, she also went to
            where the householder lived. In the courtyard, she saw the Buddha and his assembly of
            monks sitting peacefully as their meals were being offered. As the woman beheld their

            intense feeling of trust, she passed away. Now, because of this she was born in the
            Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and by this very cause she eventually achieved liberation in

            no interest in serving them either. At that time the Blessed One, the perfect buddha

            Thus-Gone One, the Blessed Vipaśyin. As he beheld him, he noticed his beautiful
            appearance and said, ‘Oh, the body of the Blessed Vipaśyin is beautifully adorned with
            the excellent signs and marks of a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha!’
            Having in this way gained a moment of trust, he passed away. <ref cRef="F.31.a" type="folio"/> As a result of that trust he was born among the gods in the Yāma
