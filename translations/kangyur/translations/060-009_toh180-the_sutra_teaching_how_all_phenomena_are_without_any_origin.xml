                                <p tid="2">While the Buddha is residing on Vulture Peak Mountain, the bodhisattva Siṃha­vikrānta­gāmin asks him a series of
                                        questions about emptiness and the nondual view in which the dichotomy between subject and object has been left
                                        behind. The Buddha responds with a discourse in verse identifying the nature of phenomena as the single
                                        principle of emptiness. Later, he teaches the bodhisattva about the dangers of judging the behavior of other
                                        bodhisattvas and imputing labels to phenomena in general, explaining that both stem from ill-founded
                                        preconceptions that are transcended with spiritual awakening. In an ensuing discussion with Mañjuśrī, the
                                        Buddha further connects many standard Buddhist concepts and categories to the nondual view that all phenomena
                                        are unborn and without intrinsic nature. Lastly, a divine being is instructed in the knowledge that overcomes
                                        the duality of various opposites, and Mañjuśrī concludes the sūtra by revealing the circumstances of his time
                                        as a beginning bodhisattva.</p>

                                        elucidation of the nature of phenomena and the way to conduct oneself. His discourse is oriented around a series of paradoxes between conduct and wisdom, and specifically highlights the interplay of monastic discipline and the activities that best serve beings. To illustrate these paradoxes the Buddha draws on scenes from his own past lives and those of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, scenes that are also meant to illustrate the negative karmic consequences of criticizing the conduct of bodhisattvas.</p>

                                        about emptiness and the nondual view by the bodhisattva Siṃha­vikrānta­gāmin. The Buddha responds with a
                                        discourse in verse identifying the single principle of emptiness as the nature of phenomena, but he
                                        cautions that immature bodhisattvas will not properly understand that teaching. Later, he tells the story of
                                        the two bodhisattvas Cāritramati and Viśuddha­cāritra to illustrate the dangers of judging the behavior of
                                        bodhisattvas because of misunderstanding the nature of their skillful means. He then explains, with great psychological insight, how such
                                        value judgements are generally based on ill-founded and preconceived notions that need to be abandoned by those who seek awakening. Next follows a discussion with Mañjuśrī in which the Buddha
                                        explains that many standard Buddhist concepts and categories used to describe the path
                                        to awakening are mere imputations, and that their true import will be realized once all phenomena are known to
                                        be unborn and without intrinsic nature. In their ensuing dialogue, various standard Buddhist expressions are
                                        relativized in terms of this ultimate, nonobjectifying view. This discussion demonstrates that the
                                        Buddhist path is only fully realized once the habitual tendency to accept, reject, or otherwise objectify  phenomena, including phenomena of the path itself, has been left behind. </p>

                                <p tid="8">In the last part of the sūtra, the Buddha, followed by Mañjuśrī, instructs a god named Playful Clairvoyant
                                        Lotus in the knowledge that penetrates sound and language and enables one to see through the duality of
                                        various opposites. Mañjuśrī is then induced to tell his story as a neophyte bodhisattva, to further illustrate
                                        the problem of negatively judging the conduct of other spiritual practitioners and underestimating the
                                        potential of a student. The sūtra refers repeatedly to the theme of <distinct>the single principle</distinct>,
                                        the realization of emptiness. When this is known, all proscribed activity—indulgence in sense pleasures and
                                        disturbing emotions—need no longer be avoided. However, since no one except the Buddha can be the final judge
                                        of another being’s conduct or realization, bodhisattvas are strongly encouraged to avoid judging one another
                                        and to teach according to the student’s capacity.</p>

                                        Chinese by Kumārajīva (fourth century, <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Zhu fa wu xing jing</title>
                                        <title xml:lang="zh">諸法無行經</title>, Taishō 650) and Jñānagupta (fifth century, <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Fu

                                        translated into English by Jens Braarvig, who also published a Sanskrit edition that includes parallel passages of the Tibetan and Chinese translations.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-009-7">Braarvig 2010 and Braarvig 2000.</note> In his introduction to the text, Braarvig tentatively dates
                                        the sole surviving Sanskrit manuscript to the fifth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, a considerably
                                        later date than that of Kumārajīva’s Chinese translation. According to the colophon to the Tibetan
                                        translation, the sūtra was translated into Tibetan by the monk Rinchen Tso, a translator active sometime
                                        during the late eighth and early ninth centuries <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. However, the Tibetan
                                        translation is not included in the early ninth-century Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar
                                                ma</foreign>) inventory of Tibetan translations, so this dating and the attribution to Rinchen Tso
                                        cannot be verified by this source. The title of the text is, however, included in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title> (as entry no. 1362), so the dating of the Tibetan translation to the early
                                        ninth century does seem reasonable in spite of its absence from the Denkarma inventory.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-009-8"> Note also the intriguing addition to the colophon as found in the Stok
                                                Palace Kangyur, where an additional sentence is added: “It was revised as well as possible in
                                                consultation with several volumes” (<foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">glegs bam du ma la gtugs

                                                Tibetan draft translations, but it is unclear to us precisely what this statement entails.</note>

                                        available, it was consulted for our translation. However, as the Sanskrit and Tibetan manuscripts are often

                                                teaching is equivalent to mastering all the six perfections. Noble son, I have stated that in realizing
                                                this principle, one completes all six perfections of the bodhisattva great beings. Why is
