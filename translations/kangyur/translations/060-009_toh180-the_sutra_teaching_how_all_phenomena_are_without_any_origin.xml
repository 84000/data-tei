                                <p tid="2">While residing on Vulture Peak Mountain, the bodhisattva Siṃha­vikrāṃta­gāmin asks the Buddha a series of
                                        questions about emptiness and the nondual view in which the dichotomy between subject and object has been left
                                        behind. The Buddha responds with a discourse in verse identifying the very nature of phenomena as the single
                                        principle of emptiness. Later, he teaches the bodhisattva about the dangers of judging the behavior of other
                                        bodhisattvas and imputing labels to phenomena in general, explaining that both stem from ill-founded
                                        preconceptions that are transcended with spiritual awakening. In an ensuing discussion with Mañjuśrī, the
                                        Buddha further connects many standard Buddhist concepts and categories to the nondual view that all phenomena
                                        are unborn and without intrinsic nature. Lastly, a divine being is instructed in the knowledge that overcomes
                                        the duality of various opposites, and Mañjuśrī concludes the sūtra by revealing the circumstances of his time
                                        as a beginning bodhisattva.</p>

                                        elucidation of the nature of phenomena and the way to conduct oneself. In doing so, the Buddha addresses the
                                        relationship between monastic conduct and the practice of beneficial activity and the interplay between
                                        conduct and wisdom. Specifically, two accounts from the past lives of the Buddha and Mañjuśrī are related that
                                        exemplify the negative karmic consequences of judging and criticizing the conduct of bodhisattvas.</p>

                                <p tid="7">The sūtra begins as the Buddha resides on Vulture Peak Mountain, where he is asked a series of questions
                                        about emptiness and the nondual view by the bodhisattva Siṃha­vikrāṃta­gāmin. The Buddha responds with a
                                        discourse in verse identifying the very nature of phenomena as the single principle of emptiness, but he
                                        cautions that immature bodhisattvas will not properly understand that teaching. Later, he tells the story of
                                        the two bodhisattvas Cāritramati and Viśuddha­cāritra to illustrate the dangers of judging the behavior of
                                        bodhisattvas and of imputing labels to phenomena. He then explains, with great psychological insight, how such
                                        value judgements and imputations are generally based on ill-founded and preconceived notions that are left
                                        behind by those who have attained awakening. Next follows a discussion with Mañjuśrī in which the Buddha
                                        explains that although many standard Buddhist concepts and categories used to prescribe and describe the path
                                        to awakening are mere imputations, their true import is nonetheless realized once all phenomena are known to
                                        be unborn and without intrinsic nature. In their ensuing dialogue, various standard Buddhist expressions are
                                        similarly relativized in terms of this ultimate, non-reifying view. The upshot of this fascinating discussion
                                        is that the Buddhist path is only fully realized once the habitual tendency to accept, reject, or otherwise
                                        reify all phenomena, including phenomena of the path itself, have been left behind. </p>

                                <p tid="8">Next follows a conversation between Mañjuśrī and some gods, in which Mañjuśrī both humbles himself and
                                        demonstrates his wisdom. In the last part of the sūtra, the Buddha, followed by Mañjuśrī, instructs a god
                                        called Playful Clairvoyant Lotus in the knowledge that penetrates sound and language and enables one to see
                                        through the duality of various opposites. Mañjuśrī is then induced to tell his story as a neophyte
                                        bodhisattva, to further illustrate the problem of negatively judging the conduct of other spiritual
                                        practitioners and underestimating the potential of a student. The sūtra refers repeatedly to the theme of
                                                <distinct>the single principle</distinct>, the realization of emptiness. When this is known, all
                                        proscribed activity—indulgence in sense pleasures and disturbing emotions—is no longer to be avoided. However,
                                        since no one except the Buddha can be the final judge of another being’s conduct or realization, bodhisattvas
                                        are strongly encouraged to avoid judging one another and to teach according to the student’s capacity.</p>

                                <p tid="9">Fortunately, fragments of a Sanskrit version of this sūtra have survived, as have two translations into
                                        Chinese by Kumārajīva (fourth century, Taishō 650) and Jñānagupta (fifth century, Taishō 651). The extant
                                        Sanskrit sections of the sūtra have been translated into English by Jens Braarvig, who has published his
                                        translation of the Sanskrit fragments along with edited Sanskrit and the Tibetan and Chinese
                                                translations.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-009-7">Braarvig 2010 and Braarvig 2000.</note> In
                                        his introduction to the text, Braarvig tentatively dates the Sanskrit text to the fifth century <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>, a considerably later date than that of Kumārajīva’s Chinese translation.
                                        According to the colophon to the Tibetan translation, the sūtra was translated into Tibetan by the monk
                                        Rinchen Tso, a translator active sometime during the late eighth and early ninth centuries <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. However, the Tibetan translation is not included in the early ninth-century
                                        Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</foreign>) inventory of Tibetan translations, so this dating
                                        and the attribution to Rinchen Tso cannot be verified by this source. The title of the text is, however,
                                        included in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title> (as entry no. 1362), so the dating of the
                                        Tibetan translation to the early ninth century does seem reasonable in spite of its absence from the Denkarma
                                                inventory.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-009-8"> Note also the intriguing addition to the
                                                colophon as found in the Stok Palace Kangyur, where an additional sentence is added: “It was revised
                                                as well as possible in consultation with several volumes” (<foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">glegs bam du ma la gtugs te ci nus kyis zhus dag bgyis</foreign>). This may perhaps refer to
                                                the existence of earlier Tibetan draft translations, but it is unclear to us precisely what this
                                                statement entails.</note>

                                        available, it was consulted for our translation. However, as the Sanskrit and Tibetan manuscripts are often

                                                Blessed One, the bodhisattva Joyful King engaged in bizarre conduct.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-060-009-354"> Tentative translation. Tibetan: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">sngon spyod spyod pa</foreign>.</note> He did not try to improve his
                                                conduct, nor did he turn away from worldly phenomena. The people in that area were of sharp spiritual
                                                faculties, and right from the start they were entirely devoted to the profound. To these beings,
                                                Joyful King did not praise having few desires, nor did he praise being contented, observing vows,
                                                delighting in solitude, or being without busyness. Instead, he taught them that all phenomena are the
                                                essential nature of desire, that all phenomena are the essential nature of aggression, that all
                                                phenomena are the essential nature of stupidity, and that all phenomena are unobscured. Through this
                                                skillful means, he taught that all actions have the same characteristic. Because of teaching this type
                                                of skillful means, these beings did not become annoyed by that bodhisattva’s conduct. They did not
                                                become angry, and they attained the level of acceptance. They were confident and certain about the
                                                teachings of the Thus-Gone One.</p>
