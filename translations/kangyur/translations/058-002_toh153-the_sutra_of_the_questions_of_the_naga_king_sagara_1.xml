                    portends the coming of the Nāga King Sāgara to Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha. The nāga king engages
                    in a lengthy dialogue with the Buddha on various topics pertaining to the distinction between
                    relative and ultimate reality, all of which emphasize the primacy of <term type="ignore">insight</term> into emptiness. The Buddha thereafter journeys to King Sāgara’s palace in the
                    ocean and reveals details of the king’s past lives in order to introduce the <distinct>inexhaustible
                        casket</distinct> dhāraṇī. In the nāga king’s palace in the ocean, he gives teachings on various
                    topics and acts as peacemaker, addressing the ongoing conflicts between the gods and asuras and
                    between the nāgas and garuḍas. Upon returning to Vulture Peak, the Buddha engages in dialogue with
                    King Ajātaśatru and provides Nāga King Sāgara’s prophecy.</p>

                    <p tid="9">Set at Vulture Peak Mountain and in the ocean realm of the Nāga King Sāgara, <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of the Nāga King Sāgara</title> covers many topics of interest to
                        bodhisattvas, including karma and rebirth and the ultimate view of emptiness. The primary
                        interlocutor is the eponymous Nāga King Sāgara, whose arrival at Vulture Peak Mountain is
                        presaged by the appearance of a magical jeweled parasol covering the entire world. With the Buddha’s consent, Sāgara asks a series of questions, which are answered in sequence. Replying
                        to a question about seeing with unobscured wisdom, the Buddha introduces a distinction between
                        ordinary seeing and wisdom seeing, indicating that seeing with unobscured wisdom allows the
                        bodhisattva greater perception that includes both relative and ultimate reality. At this point
                        the Buddha’s discourse is explicitly identified by the gods, who have been listening in the sky
                        above, as belonging to the second turning of the wheel of Dharma.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-004-1208"/>
                    <p tid="10">In a story recalling one of the Nāga King Sāgara’s past lives, the Buddha introduces the
                            <distinct>jeweled casket</distinct> dhāraṇī, also known as the <distinct>inexhaustible
                            casket</distinct> dhāraṇī. This dhāraṇī turns out to have had an impact on all Nāga King
                        Sāgara’s previous lives on the path to awakening. The Buddha explains that this dhāraṇī can be
                        used by bodhisattvas to recognize nonduality, allowing them to continue working for the benefit
                        of beings in saṃsāra without ever becoming contaminated. Asked about it by the king, the
                        Buddha mentions the growing population of nāgas present during the king’s reign, explaining that
                        they were disciples of the previous buddha Krakucchanda who let their vows of discipline lapse.
                        Later, the Buddha performs a miracle allowing the entire assembly to visit Nāga King Sāgara’s
                        realm on the seabed deep in the ocean. There the Buddha delivers a discourse on how the body is
                        formed by one’s previous actions, and he proceeds to explain the benefits that accrue from
                        abandoning nonvirtues. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-058-004-1209"/>
                    <p tid="11">At two points in the sūtra, the Buddha is asked to intervene in the conflicts between
                        the gods and asuras and between the nāgas and garuḍas. In the first case, at Śakra’s request the
                        Buddha teaches the asuras about the power of love to inspire them to get along with the gods.
                        Later, he blesses his shawl and gives it to the nāgas to protect them from the garuḍas. This
                        distresses the garuḍas, but they are consoled by the Buddha and inspired to abandon nonvirtue
                        after he gives them a teaching about cause and effect. </p>

                    <p tid="643">Like many Great Vehicle sūtras, this work contains prophecies about how various
                        beings who are present during this teaching will attain perfect awakening in a future lifetime. 
                        When the Nāga King Sāgara receives the prophecy of his own awakening, he takes that
                        opportunity to question the existence of any phenomena that might provide a basis for that
                        prophecy as well as the existence of any being who might function as that prophecy's subject. He
                        points out that it is only by giving up such notions that one can receive the buddhas’ prophecy.
                        This theme runs throughout the text: advancement on the path of the Great Vehicle is made
                        through the ultimate <term type="ignore">insight</term> that all phenomena are without intrinsic
                        essence and thus beyond subject and object, yet this realization of emptiness in no way runs
                        counter to engagement with dependently arisen relative phenomena. </p>

                        delivers a special teaching addressed to a throng of ten thousand wide-eyed nāga women, which
                        includes Nāga King Sāgara’s daughter, the Buddha’s attendant Mahākāśyapa interjects that 
                        it is impossible for anyone with a female body to attain awakening. Sāgara’s daughter
                        immediately rejects Mahākāśyapa’s view on the grounds that anyone with pure motivation can
                        attain awakening and that it contradicts the doctrine of universal emptiness or nonessentiality.
                        She explains that male and female properties are essences wrongly attributed to otherwise empty
                        mental and physical phenomena, and that “awakening has neither female nor male attributes.” With
                        this logic of nonessentiality, she successfully undermines essentialized notions of gender and
                        defends the ability of women to cultivate the mind set on awakening. In the end, the Buddha
                        prophesies her awakening as the male buddha <term>Samantavipaśyin</term>.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-058-004-11"> This

                    <p tid="13">As this discourse draws to a close, a myriad of bodhisattvas, gods, and women commit to
                        uphold the Buddha’s awakening. They at first seem doubtful that one may preserve the Buddha’s
                        awakening by emphasizing the ultimate view, but the Buddha reassures them that this can be done.
                        Śakra then expresses his amazement at the way in which the women in the gathering have been able
                        to express themselves in accord with the ultimate Dharma. The Buddha once again confirms the
                        women’s abilities as Dharma teachers, and subsequently entrusts Śakra with upholding the sūtra.
                        Both of these events indicate that while the Saṅgha may generally have been reluctant to
                        recognize women as fully qualified practitioners and teachers of the Dharma, the discourse on
                        ultimate reality provided a context for declaring the equality of male and female, both in terms
                        of the nonessentiality of gender constructs and the equal ability of both men and women to
                        cultivate the pure motivation of the mind set on awakening.</p>

                            <distinct>me</distinct> and <distinct>mine</distinct>. It is patience that is cultivated
                        through inner purity, the purity of beings, and the purity of all phenomena. While cultivating
                        patience, they neither meditate on nor fail to meditate on any phenomena; they do not meditate
                        on phenomena in order to create or prevent any phenomena; and they do not meditate on phenomena
                        in order to exhaust or quell any phenomena. Given the fact that beings are selfless and void,
                        they are not scared or frightened and will not become so. Moreover, this patience is not
                        performed while observing body, speech, or mind. When the body is destroyed or their limbs and
                        digits are cut off, they will accept it and regard them as being like grass, trees, or walls. If
                        they hear another speaking ill, they will accept it knowing that speech itself is hollow, void,
                        empty, insubstantial, peaceful, and nonabiding. They practice patience by understanding that the
                        mind is not turbid, new, or old, is without connection, and does not exist because of perishing
                        momentarily. To see this absence of continuity is the bodhisattvas’ practice of patience that is

                        engage in diligence in order to multiply their roots of virtue. Yet such increasing of diligence
                        does not cause them to perceive any increase or decrease with regard to the realm of phenomena.
                        Knowing all phenomena to be contained within the realm of phenomena, <ref cRef="F.131.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-004-1034"/> they do not perceive any phenomena whatsoever
                        to be truly existent. Rather, they perceive all phenomena of the world to be false and mistaken.
                        In this way, when bodhisattvas look to any phenomenon with pure insight, they know that
                        phenomena cannot be made to increase or decrease, that phenomena are not of an aggregated
                        nature, that they are not present in any place or direction, and that they do not come from
                        anywhere or go anywhere. Because their diligence has this quality, bodhisattvas diligently teach
                        the Dharma to all beings to make them understand what is mistaken and what is true. Yet they do
                        not truly apprehend any such beings. Not apprehending any beings, they also do not apprehend any
                        phenomena. Why is this? There are no phenomena separate from beings, nor are there any beings
                        separate from phenomena. Still, the essential nature of phenomena is also the essential nature
                        of the self. The essential nature of the self is the essential nature of all phenomena. The
                        essential nature of all phenomena is the essential nature of the qualities of buddhahood. All

                        into concentrations, those concentrations do not decline from sameness, nor do they enhance it.
                        When bodhisattvas practice concentration, they do not generate or attenuate any phenomena. <ref cRef="F.131.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-004-1035"/> They concentrate without relying
                        on any reference point, and so they concentrate in a way that is neither in accord nor in
                        discord with any phenomena. They do not perfect the branches of concentration, the contemplation
                        of concentration, or the applications of concentration through either body or mind. When
                        bodhisattvas reach attainment, that attainment is similar to attainment reached through
                        thusness, the limit of reality, and the realm of phenomena. They reach attainment because of the
                        equality of all beings and the absence of superimposition about phenomena. As they exert
                        themselves in cultivating absorption, they dwell neither within nor without the body or mind.
                        The mind that does not dwell on any outer object is a consciousness that remains nowhere; it
                        surpasses all referential attainments. It surpasses the non-Buddhist sages who have the five
                        higher knowledges, all hearers and solitary buddhas, and all states of concentration and
                        attainments of concentration. Its roots of virtue and states of concentration are predominantly
                        characterized by insight and are devoid of all afflicted views. It is dedicated to awakening and
                        accomplishes the ripening of beings. In this way, through a single meditative attainment, a
                        thus-gone one accomplishes everything up to the finality of parinirvāṇa. This is the
                        bodhisattvas’ concentration that is grounded in insight.</p>

                        Any phenomena they see are clearly seen by the eye of insight alone. However, these phenomena
                        cannot be clearly seen by either the physical <ref cRef="F.132.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-004-1036"/> or divine eye. They are only clearly seen to be peace, and
                        never as anything other than peace. Likewise, phenomena are clearly seen to be still,
                        nonpersisting, void, and unreal. Such seeing is clearly seeing all phenomena. Given that they
                        clearly see all phenomena in this way, if they were to see any phenomenon, that would not be
                        special insight. Why is this? Because special insight does not arise from seeing phenomena, and
                        knowing them is ignorance. Not seeing them is special insight into phenomena. Not seeing the
                        self, being, life force, soul, person, or individual is special insight into phenomena.
                        Therefore, because bodhisattvas see such phenomena accurately and beings see them mistakenly,
                        bodhisattvas think, ‘Alas, beings are afflicted because they think phenomena are like this.’
                        They generate great compassion for such beings, and they develop great love for beings in order
                        to liberate them. Thus, knowing that even these beings have never existed is the bodhisattvas’
                        special insight into phenomena that is grounded in insight.</p>

                        the self, being, life principle, soul, personhood, individuality, existence, or substance.
                        Rather, Nāga Lord, they ripen beings only according to their essential nature. </p>

                        King of Brahmā’s Splendor appeared. He was a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha,

                        decorated with all manner of jewels and were brilliant and beautiful to behold. The Blessed One
                        then blessed the mass of water in the ocean so that it became invisible and would not harm any
                        being. Next, light from the Blessed One’s body illuminated the ocean as when light spreads out
                        to illuminate the worlds of the great trichiliocosm. Every being in the ocean who was merely
                        touched by this light adopted a loving, altruistic, friendly, and happy attitude. Henceforth
                        none of them harbored malice or harmfulness toward one another. Instead they all had the

                        and that cannot become afflicted by any māras of affliction whatsoever is a prophetic teaching.
                        Neither accepting, giving up, thinking of, nor conceptualizing emptiness and the absence of

                        is no observation of a prophecy, an awakening, people being given a prophecy a prophet, or a

                        degenerate, one will see emancipation from everything, for by not looking, one correspondingly

                        is given are understood to be the same phenomena, the realm of phenomena devoid of phenomena,
                        incommunicable, nonarising, neither entities nor nonentities, and the very limit of nonduality.
                        Thus, one does not take notice of any phenomena whatsoever. To draw an analogy, space cannot be

                                mythology. Devas make regular appearances in Buddhist literature at the head of the
                                assemblies of celestial beings who attend the teachings, interact with the Buddha,
                                bodhisattvas, and other spiritual figures, and celebrate the delivery of their
                                teachings. In Buddhist cosmology, the devas are subdivided into numerous classes based
                                on the specific <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">devalokas</foreign>, the
                                “heavens” in which they reside. Traditionally there are between twenty-six and

                                either through meritorious acts or the cultivation of subtle meditative states, and is
                                therefore considered a higher mode of rebirth in comparison to rebirth among hell
                                beings, pretas, and animals. Nonetheless, all the devalokas are within the three realms
                                of saṃsāra and therefore transitory. Thus while the devas occupy the highest strata

                            <term type="definition">A frequently used synonym for <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddha</foreign>. According to different explanations, it can be read as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathā-gata</foreign>, literally meaning “one who has thus gone,”
                                or as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathā-āgata</foreign>, “one who has thus come.”
                                    <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Gata</foreign>, though literally meaning “gone,” is a
                                past passive participle used to describe a state or condition of existence. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Tatha­(tā)</foreign>, often rendered as “suchness” or “thusness,”
                                is the quality or condition of things as they really are, which cannot be conveyed in
                                conceptual, dualistic terms. Therefore, this epithet is interpreted in different ways,
                                but in general it implies one who has gone in the same way that the buddhas of the past
                                have gone, or one who has manifested the supreme awakening dependent on the reality that
                                does not abide in the two extremes of existence and quiescence.</term>

                                Buddhist contexts the term implies that a buddha is in possession of six auspicious

                                saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—possibly reflects the commentarial tradition where the Sanskrit

                                have first exhorted Śākyamuni to teach the Dharma. The particular heavens found in the

                                higher rebirth in Buddhist literature. Since there are multiple universes and world
                                systems, there are also multiple Brahmās presiding over them.</term>

                                signify either the known human world, or more specifically the Indian subcontinent,
                                literally “the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jambu</foreign> island/continent.” Jambu is
                                the name used for a range of plum-like fruits from trees belonging to the genus <foreign xml:lang="la">Szygium</foreign>, particularly <foreign xml:lang="la">Szygium
                                    jambos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">Szygium cumini</foreign>, and has
                                commonly been rendered “rose apple,” although “black plum” may be a less misleading
                                term. Among various explanations given for the continent being so named, one (in the
                                    <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharmakośa</title>) is that a jambu tree grows in its
                                northern mountains beside Lake Anavatapta, mythically considered the source of the four
                                great rivers of India, and that the continent is therefore named from the tree or the
                                fruit. Jambudvīpa has the vajrāsana at its center and is the only continent upon which
                                buddhas attain awakening.</term>

                                of King Bimbisāra and then of his son King Ajātaśatru. Rājagṛha is also remembered as
