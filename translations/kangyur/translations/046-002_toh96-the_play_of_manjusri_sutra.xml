                              is presented within a rich narrative involving a beautiful courtesan’s daughter, Suvarṇottama­prabhāśrī, and a banker’s son who purchases her favors.
                            Suvarṇottama­prabhāśrī is seduced by Mañjuśrī who gives her instructions related to the meaning of the mind set on awakening. She then transmits her new understanding
                            to the city of Rājagṛha, in the presence of King Ajātaśatru and his retinue. This sūtra deals with well-known Mahāyāna Buddhist themes, but special emphasis is placed on the concepts of the
                              emptiness and sameness of all phenomena.

                                        is a typical Mahāyāna sūtra in the sense that it
                                                deals with the key terms of the abhidharma systems, as well as the main concepts of the
                                                Mahāyāna, in the context of emptiness and the deconstruction of concepts.
                                                However, the text is also furnished with an interesting frame story,
                                                also not unusual for the Mahāyāna style, depicting a person who is
                                                otherwise not supposed to be particularly saintly: a young prostitute
                                                named Suvarṇottama­prabhāśrī. This girl, whose skin shines with a golden
                                                hue and who is the most beautiful of all girls, is courted by all the
                                                boys in town. One, the banker’s son Bhayadatta (Given to Fear),
                                                purchases her favors, but when the girl sees the princely Mañjuśrī, she
                                                instantly falls in love with him. Then, the god of riches, Vaiśravaṇa,
                                                appears, introduces Mañjuśrī by name, and, on being asked, explains what
                                                a bodhisatva<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-046-002-9"> We prefer to follow the mainstream Buddhist Sanskrit
                                                    usage of manuscripts and inscriptions by spelling <distinct>bodhisatva</distinct>
                                                    with a single rather than a double <distinct>t</distinct>, the latter being a
                                                    convention of modern editors. See Bhattacharya (2010). Note that this is
                                                    also the spelling used in Gāndhārī, as well as in Khotanese, in
                                                    Tibetan lexicography, and in old Thai documents.</note> is. Mañjuśrī is clad in fine white garb, as is usual
                                                for laymen, and the girl asks the bodhisatva whether she can have it.
                                                “Yes, you can,” says the great figure, “if you develop the mind of
                                                awakening.” When the prostitute asks what this is, Mañjuśrī answers,
                                                “you yourself are awakening,” and “all beings are included in
                                                awakening.” This accords with the Mahāyāna conviction that truth and
                                                awakening are not found in some theoretical system, but in what we
                                                are as human beings and in compassionate action toward our fellow
                                                beings, whichever class they might belong to. In this way, the sūtra
                                                also goes to great lengths to argue for universal sameness. As elsewhere
                                                in the Mahāyāna scriptures, 
                                        <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nirvāṇa</foreign> is the same as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">saṃsāra</foreign>, and so even
                                                the afflicted mental states are really the same as awakening—prefiguring
                                                a tantric world view. As our text says: “The afflicted mental states are also the
                                                adamantine basis of awakening.” This is
                                                because understanding the afflicted mental states is in fact awakening.
                                                The way to get rid of the afflicted mental states is to understand their
                                                emptiness. Suvarṇottama­prabhāśrī proclaims her new understanding to the
                                                city of Rājagṛha in the presence of King Ajātaśatru and his entire
                                                retinue of women and warriors. It is even acknowledged by the Buddha
                                                himself, who is taking a walk with Ānanda on the slopes of Vulture Peak.
                                        
                                </p>

                                <p tid="7">Having now met the beautiful Mañjuśrī, adopted his
                                                teaching, and attained a higher goal in life, Suvarṇottama­prabhāśrī
                                                decides to teach her male friends about the mind of awakening. As a
                                                consequence of this, she follows the Mahāyāna call never to tire in
                                                educating our fellow beings, and thus, in the park where she has gone to
                                                amuse herself with the banker’s son, Bhayadatta, she transforms herself
                                                into a rotting corpse in accord with the canonical meditation practice
                                                that describes our frail bodily existence ending up as a stinking
                                                cadaver. Seeing his beautiful companion thus transformed, Bhayadatta is
                                                filled with great abhorrence, and then fear—as befits his name. He is
                                                also afraid of being punished by the king’s men, and so he flees the
                                                scene and leaves the corpse, which had been a beautiful girl only a few
                                                moments before. All goes well, however, and they end up with the Buddha,
                                                where a dialogue takes place between Mañjuśrī and the Blessed One on
                                                general Mahāyāna themes. The girl is also present—her death was only a
                                                magical creation and an expedient means employed to educate the fearful
                                                boy. The boy then seeks refuge in the only refuge that is worth
                                                anything, namely the Blessed One himself, who confirms by his teachings
                                                to him that the bodhisatva does indeed seek awakening by seeking the
                                                essence of desire, and that fear is just an illusion grounded in
                                                attachment to the false idea of a self, just as had been argued in the
                                                previous dialogues.

                                                literally means “Mañjuśrī’s Amusement”—the verb <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">krīḍ</foreign>- (and thus also <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vikrīḍ</foreign>-) means to amuse oneself
                                                and to have fun, but here also to play with the supernatural knowledges
                                                and states of meditation. This word also often has a sexual connotation.
                                                Evidently, though, Mañjuśrī’s games have as their purpose the education
                                                of all living beings about awakening and the mind of awakening, and even
                                                the sexual games of a prostitute may be transformed into those of a
                                                bodhisatva. In this way, this sūtra appears to be directed toward a lay
                                                audience with only a single formalistic reference to the monastic
                                                community in the opening phrase of the text. The girl even asks in which
                                                religious group (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gaṇa</foreign>) the Mahāyāna teachings are to be found—evidently referring to a lay
                                                group rather than the saṅgha. Embracing the life of an ascetic monk is
                                                not highly valued in this sūtra. As Mañjuśrī says, in tune with the
                                                message of the text, when his new pupil asks him to help her adopt the
                                                monastic way of life, “It is like this, sister. Shaving the hair on your
                                                head is not equivalent to embracing the ascetic life as it pertains to
                                                the bodhisatva. Why not? Girl, bodhisatvas embrace the ascetic life by
                                                means of the effort to eliminate the afflicted mental states of all
                                                beings.” Engaging in ordinary lay life with all its imperfections rather than
                                                living in monastic isolation is the ideal set forth. Practicing the
                                                altruistic social virtues of compassion, friendliness, and so forth,
                                                rather than leading a silent life of meditation, is the obligation of
                                                the bodhisatva according to this text. This takes us to the core of the
                                                Mahāyāna ideology, shared by a great number of Mahāyāna sūtras: Any
                                                person, be they a prostitute, or a powerful layman, even one living a
                                                licentious life, may be a great bodhisatva who has sought such a rebirth
                                                for the sake of their fellow beings. Birth is really an illusion,
                                                suffering is really emptiness, and great compassion is the means for
                                                reaching this radical acceptance, this understanding, which is the same
                                                as awakening.

                                                        Suvarṇottama­prabhāśrī, who was beautiful, charming, and
                                                        attractive, was living in the great city of Rājagṛha. Her
                                                        beautiful complexion was the most abundant of her riches.
                                                        Because of the roots of virtue she had previously developed,

                                                        walked. Whatever clothes she put on, whether they were red or
                                                        white, would shine with precisely the same golden color. That

                                                        the light emanating from his garment. As soon as she had seen

                                                        She thought, “I have had enough of this banker’s son. I will get

                                                        sister, the essential nature of the aggregates is the essential

                                                        such fear. “As punishment for this girl’s fate, King Ajātaśatru
                                                        will kill me,” he thought. He moved the girl off his lap and
                                                        tried to escape, but he was unable to. All of his companions saw
                                                        his great and terrible fear and ran away.</p>

                                                        doctrinal viewpoints is the cause. Attachment caused by thirst
                                                        is the cause. Egotism and self-centered ideas are the cause.
                                                        Attachment to things is the cause. Possessions and quarreling
                                                        are the cause. The fetter of viewing things as substantial and
                                                        real is the cause. Seeing the impermanent as permanent is the
                                                        cause. Seeing suffering as happiness is the cause. Seeing the
                                                        ugly as beautiful is the cause. Seeing no-self as self is the
                                                        cause. The idea that there is something to hold on to among the
                                                        aggregates is the cause. Lack of insight into the elements is
                                                        the cause. Absence of knowledge of the sense sources is the
                                                        cause. Not seeing the defects of the body is the cause.
                                                        Enjoyment of life is the cause. Fear and terror arise from these
                                                        causes, and so they should be done away with.

                                                        illusory. They are like an illusion because they are manifested
                                                        from nothing. They are like a dream because they provide a
                                                        limited kind of enjoyment. They are like a mirage because they
                                                        manifest out of bewilderment. They are like a visual distortion
                                                        because they have never arisen in the first place. They are like
                                                        a reflection because actions culminate in their effects.

                                                        because there is no movement. They are like an echo because
                                                        sound is produced from the soundless. They are like shadows
                                                        because they are the gate of non-production. They are like an

                                                        The understanding of thought is beyond demonstration, beyond

                                                        Moreover, my boy, there is nothing that bodhisatvas need to
                                                        understand apart from their own thoughts. To understand one’s
                                                        own thoughts is indeed to understand the thoughts of all beings.
                                                        If one’s own thoughts stand aloof, the thoughts of all beings
                                                        stand aloof. By understanding the essence of one’s own thoughts,
                                                        one understands the essence of the thoughts of all beings. If
                                                        one’s own thoughts are pure, the thoughts of all beings are

                                                        aversion, the thoughts of all beings are without aversion. If
                                                        one’s own thoughts are without bewilderment, <ref type="folio" cRef="F.239.b"/> the
