                                                is particularly valuable, and we have used it as the primary reference for the Sanskrit. However, all
                                                the above Sanskrit versions differ, in various respects, from the Kangyur version, and the Nepalese
                                                manuscripts edited by Ferrari, although not comparably old, contain sections that match the Tibetan
                                                translation more closely. Overall, the hypothetical Sanskrit original of (almost all) the Tibetan
                                                translation can be evinced by comparing the existing Sanskrit versions and looking at parallel
                                                passages in other Sanskrit and Pāli texts. This is extremely helpful, for it can greatly clarify the
                                                intended syntax of the Tibetan and, in a few cases, show how some obscure expression may be due to a
                                                mistake (even a printing mistake) in the transmission of the Tibetan.</p>

                                                This English translation was prepared based on the Tibetan translation in the Degé Kangyur in consultation 
                                                with the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>) and the Stok Palace Kangyur. According to the Tibetan translators’ 
                                                colophon, the Sanskrit text was translated into Tibetan by the Indian preceptors Jinamitra and Prajñā­varman, 
                                                and the Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé. 
                                                This would place the translation in the early ninth century, but it is worth 
                                                noting that the translation is absent from both the Denkarma and Phangtangma inventories of Tibetan translations 
                                                dated to that time.
                                                It is also worth mentioning that Jinamitra and Yeshé Dé figure among the

                                                which is a useful point to bear in mind when trying to understand the relationship between the Tibetan
                                                translation and the various Sanskrit versions.</p>

                                                significant, considering also that the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvyutpatti</title> has an entry

                                                of reading Vīryaśrīdatta’s comments, some of which will be found in the notes and in the glossary, so

                                                His glosses thus offer some keys to the subtlety, greatness, and extraordinary dedication of the

                                                                premise, since we believe that here <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dharma</foreign> means “entity” rather “category,” and indeed dharmas as
                                                                entities are meanings/referents as opposed to words (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">śabda</foreign>). Another argument adduced by Samtani is based on
                                                                his interpretation of a quote from Yaśomitra, where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">artha</foreign> is equated with <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">viṣaya</foreign>, which in turn Samtani explains as “subject

                                                                rather strongly suggests that it is not explaining the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">artha</foreign> as meaning “subject matter” but rather as
