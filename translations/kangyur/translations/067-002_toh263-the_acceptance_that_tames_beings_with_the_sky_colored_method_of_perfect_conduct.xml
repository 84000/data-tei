            long sūtra divided into eleven chapters in which the Buddha and several
            bodhisattvas deliver a series of teachings focusing on the view of emptiness and
            the bodhisattva conduct, in order to convert beings to the Great Vehicle. The
            text reveals the view of the sky-like nature of all inner and outer formations
            while providing detailed descriptions of the practices of non-Buddhists, and
            insisting on the importance for bodhisattvas to be reborn and practice in impure
            realms rife with the five degenerations in order to awaken to buddhahood.</p>

          a series of teachings focusing on the relationship between the understanding of emptiness and the
          conduct of a bodhisattva, especially the perfection of acceptance or patience. The text
          describes the implications of the view that all inner and outer formations—that is, all
          phenomena made up of the five aggregates—are empty. It also provides detailed
          descriptions of the ascetic practices of non-Buddhists and insists on the importance for
          bodhisattvas of being reborn in buddha realms inundated with the five impurities for the sake
          of the beings living there, and of practicing in such realms to fulfill the highest goals of
          the bodhisattva path.</tei:p>

            Tibetan folios in the Degé Kangyur, that focus on the implications of the view of
            emptiness on the conduct of a bodhisattva. The text addresses three core issues: How
            should one teach the hearers and solitary buddhas from the perspective of the Great
            Vehicle? Why should bodhisattvas choose to teach in unfavorable world systems and to the
            afflicted beings who are living there? And how should they tame non-Buddhists and direct
            them toward the Dharma? </tei:p>

          <tei:p tid="10">At a mountain hermitage, near a town named Removing Impurities, the Buddha Śākyamuni and the bodhisattva
            Destroyer of Aggregates explain to the monks and bodhisattvas assembled around them that
            all things are empty, and that bodhisattvas who gain this realization attain an
            acceptance with which they tame beings using the method of perfect conduct.
            This initial discourse ends with a group of hearers leaving the assembly, and the
            teaching thus introduces the idea that some Buddhist practitioners are not yet ready for
            the profound teaching of the Great Vehicle. </tei:p>

          <tei:p tid="11">At the request of his remaining audience, however, the Buddha agrees to reveal
            the nature of this acceptance on Mount Gandhamādana, where an immense number of
            bodhisattvas and divine beings gather from universes in the ten directions. Through his
            miraculous powers, the Buddha appears there as a non-Buddhist seer performing a huge
            fire sacrifice, and he transforms many of the other beings present into seers engaging
            in all kinds of non-Buddhist practices. When he does so, a few of the remaining great
            hearers are portrayed as being unable to perceive where the Buddha has gone, and at the
            same time a number of the remaining bodhisattvas, disheartened by the sight, decide to
            leave and return to their respective realms. This situation prompts a teaching on the
            necessity for bodhisattvas to remain in impure buddha realms inundated with the five
            impurities for the sake of the beings living there and in order to reach the level of
            “great beings” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mahāsattvas</foreign>) who strive
            to fulfill the highest goals of the bodhisattva path. </tei:p>

            form of seers, the Buddha, also still in the form of a seer, then delivers an extensive
            discourse on the correct view that must be adopted so that one may cultivate the
            acceptance with which one can tame beings through the sky-colored method of perfect
            conduct. This long teaching, which constitutes the heart of the sūtra, explains and
            expands at some length on the idea that the nature of all the inner and outer
            formations, including the aggregates, the elements, the sense fields, and the twelve
            links of dependent arising, are empty. That all things are empty would also appear to be
            the implication of the comparison with the color of space or the sky.</tei:p>

          <tei:p tid="13">Then, through the power of his meditative absorption, the Buddha attracts a
            great multitude of deluded beings engaging in improper practices to Mount Gandhamādana
            to clear away their wrong views and establish them on the correct path. The teaching he
            delivers to them contains detailed descriptions of non-Buddhist practices and behavior.
            It insists on the fact that such ascetic practices and observances are directly inspired
            by the māras, and that none of them leads to liberation. Yet, he also emphasizes the
            necessity for bodhisattvas to appear among such beings to tame them and direct them
            toward the practice of the true Dharma. The Buddha provides supporting examples for his
            instruction by recounting events from two of his former lives. In the first story, he
            was a king who vowed to free non-Buddhist practitioners from old age and death, and who
            then realized this acceptance and transmitted his realization to beings in the ten
            directions. In the second story, he describes the spiritual transformation of a brahmin
            named Gaṅga whom he met when he was another king. Inspired by another buddha living at
            that time, that brahmin renounced his devotional practices, took refuge in the Three
            Jewels, and made a series of aspirations that led him to the realization of this
            acceptance. </tei:p>

            significant that the name of the acceptance described throughout this sūtra is presented

            should think about and analyze correctly. What are those eight aspects, noble son? Forms
            are made of the four great elements; forms are diseases; desires have the characteristic

            insight that are related to the cause, the lack of causes and conditions, and the lack
            of conditions, and this correct insight sees through the darkness of ignorance. What is
            mental engagement that is improper and a state of ignorance? At what point does one
            apprehend improper mental engagement? When one apprehends physical, verbal, and mental
            formations, even the body is based upon the four great elements. As previously stated,
            those four great elements are unwavering, unchanging, lack a self, and have no sense of
            ownership. One does not apprehend language in them, and they have no words, and since
            one does not apprehend them as a self, they are groundless. The mental consciousness is
            also groundless, does not abide, and is a mere verbal designation. It has no self, no
            body, and no person. The apprehension of body, speech, and mind is also empty of
            duality. Therefore, even ignorance is empty. The indeterminate stream of thought does
            not go away. What appears to have characteristics is inexpressible. Ignorance, craving
            existence, the mind, the mental consciousness, the three realms, and the apprehension of
            the three times are not apprehended from the perspective of ultimate truth, and virtue
            and nonvirtue do not exist in terms of the characteristics of virtue. Therefore,

            no longer present. Ignorance, which lacks both arising and ceasing, ceases in the first
            moment and formations arise in the second moment. Therefore, ignorance is empty; its
            essence has no self. The moment that formations arise, they cease, whether they are
            physical, verbal, or mental formations. Once physical formations have arisen, verbal
            formations arise in the ultimate state that is free from attachment. Even from the
            ultimate perspective of liberation, the continuous stream of mental formations then
            follows verbal formations. If physical formations do not arise, the activity of the
            verbal and mental formations will not develop. One investigates the correct
            understanding of formations, grasping, and the feelings related to physical formations
            and does not become attached. If mental formations do not arise, the activity of the
            physical and verbal formations in the three times will neither develop nor be
            eliminated. If verbal formations do not arise, the activity of the physical and mental
            formations in the three times will also neither develop nor be eliminated. Since the
            basis of the characteristics of the three formations is like that, the bases of
            consciousness and the appearances one experiences in the three realms are neither
            acquired nor eliminated. Therefore, those formations are empty.</tei:p>

            related to contact, perception, and volition have disintegrated. What are the feelings?
            The six kinds of feelings consist of feelings that arise through eye contact, through
            ear contact, through nose contact, through tongue contact, through body contact, and
            through mind contact. The feelings arise from the arising of contact, but not in a

            aggregates, and that is annihilation.’ Both those views should be abandoned. Why? The

            Bodhisattvas should analyze each and every detail in the same way as analyzing the great

            would analyze a pillar. Just as a pillar might stand in the sky but is not based there
            because it is supported by the earth, so too the basis, forms, are like a mass of foam.
            By apprehending forms and the absence of forms, <ref cRef="F.152.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-067-002-1320"/> one becomes involved with forms and the absence of
            forms, and one is not free from forms and the absence of forms. However, if one discards
            the activity of forms and the absence of forms, as well as the forms and the absence of
            forms themselves, and considers those forms to have no essence, like a mass of foam, one
            will find that they are empty. Whether they apply or they do not apply, words come forth
            from the mouth based on the condition of the breath. They are wordless and
            inexpressible, and one should understand that the sounds of the three realms are empty
            in the same way. One should understand the smells of the three realms in the same way
            that the breath contained in the body, the wind that courses through space, and space
            itself are without smells and empty. One should understand the quality of taste that
            oneself and the three realms possess is empty in the same way that a pot fills with
            drops of rain but there is no one who places the drops inside of it. No one accomplishes
            this. No one does this or causes it to be done. So, it is entirely without anyone who
            takes hold of it and attends to it. One should understand that the sense of touch
            related to the three realms is empty in the same way that a pot is not established as
            being conjoined with space. It is not in space, and space and the pot are free from
            contact with one another and are inanimate. The wheel of delusion regarding the five
            sense pleasures leads to craving some desire and craving some form just like a bee drawn

            opposing factors in terms of lack of sameness and lack of difference. One should not
            create duality; after one understands that all phenomena behave in the same way as the
            realm of phenomena, one does not think that the realm of phenomena and ultimate reality
            arise or cease in the least. Thus, the nature of the realm of phenomena is groundless,
            and this is the ultimate reality. What is ultimately real is the nature of all
            phenomena. This is the position that circumscribes the three fields. It is the position
            that is without boundary or division. It is the position that is without annihilation
            and permanence. It is the position of things as they truly are. With this position one
            encompasses all phenomena. The extent of this position and absence of this position are
            not two things, because one does not apprehend the craving for existence. The position
            regarding all things, such as the life force, the being, the soul, and the person, is
            one of nonduality. The position regarding ultimate reality, the position of the
            transitory collection, and the elimination of craving are also nondual. And in that way,
            the position of the transitory collection is what eliminates desire. When one
            understands in that way, there will be twenty aspects to this view of the transitory
            collection. Ultimate reality is not the same as involvement with craving. Ultimate
            reality is without going. It comes to an end in the sense that when it has gone it is
            not extinguished and is not established, and so craving is the gateway to the

            that are not discerned by the eye consciousness are also immaterial, inexpressible,
            wordless, and not apprehended as real things. Since the eye consciousness is also not
            apprehended as a real thing, it is immaterial and without characteristics too. Since
            space, fire, and the eyes are also not apprehended as real things, they are
            inexpressible and wordless too. Thus, when they perceive an attractive form, up to
            having a desire for it, they do not apprehend the eye consciousness or the form or even
            the intervening space as a real thing. The eye consciousness that perceives fire arises
            and ceases, and is no longer present in the second moment. Feelings arise in the second
            moment, and bodhisattvas perceive them as masses of radiating light. Those feelings are
            inexpressible, beyond words, and free from marks. Feelings arise and cease and then
            perceptions arise as the basis of the next moment. These are perceived like the
            radiating light of a blazing tongue of flame. After those perceptions have arisen and
            ceased, formations arise as the basis of the second moment. Bodhisattvas perceive these
            as radiating lights that are either small or immeasurably large and either far or near.
            Then, once those formations have arisen and ceased, consciousness arises in the next
            moment. Bodhisattvas perceive that as a mass of radiating light that arises and
            disintegrates. <ref cRef="F.154.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-067-002-1324"/> This
            consciousness is inexpressible and a wordless state. It instantly disintegrates. It is
            like something imputed upon space. The space around the fire is also insubstantial,
            inexpressible, and wordless. All those masses of radiating light that they see arise,
            blaze forth, and cease have the characteristic of being just like space. They are
            inexpressible and insubstantial. They are innumerable, and each of their light rays is
            without conditions. Bodhisattvas should analyze the five sense pleasures that arise and
            cease in the same way that they analyze all of the phenomena that arise and cease—that
            they are like imputations in space, inexpressible, and insubstantial. They should
            cultivate the acceptance of this fact.”</tei:p>

            inseparable, that the generation of the three vows is unmoving, that there are no
            afflictions, and that formations are not purified, this is cultivating likeness and
            sameness. <ref cRef="F.156.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-067-002-1329"/> Apprehending
            the nondual objects of the six perfections as lasting and real, conceiving of wisdom in

            established is defiled and conflicts with the acceptance of suffering related to
            formations that are accompanied by grasping. When pride occurs in regard to the
            nonduality of the six perfections; the fact that the three times are inseparable,
            unborn, and unceasing; and there being no discontinuation, no permanence, and no

            buddhas and develops strong attachment to the good qualities one experiences through
            pursuing the Great Vehicle, and when one releases a rain of Dharma on beings who are
            proper vessels and beings who are not proper vessels upon meeting them, and when one
            thinks about penances and restrictions; apprehends a being, a life force, production, a

            conditions; and dwells on and is arrogant about the fruition of virtuous and nonvirtuous
            actions. This destroys the acceptance of the suffering associated with formations
            related to grasping. When one does not think about the vows of the three times related
            to the vehicles of the hearers and the solitary buddhas, does not conceptualize them,
            does not cling to them, does not give them up, does not generate them, and does not

            does not give them up, does not generate them, and does not discard them; when one does
            not apprehend them as the true essence of living a religious life; and when one does not
            apprehend them as having the characteristic of not developing conceit regarding the

            the teaching that all phenomena that are alike and the same actually do not arise and

            When bodhisattvas have carried out a detailed analysis and the root of supreme virtue
            has completely arisen, they move throughout space and do not focus their attention on,
            or become conceited about, the three times or all manner of formations. In this way,

            not engage with the three times and formations or cultivate any and all such phenomena.
            They know that they are free from cultivation and are without tone, without language,
            and wordless. They know that they do not arise, do not cease, and have no
            characteristics. They know that they are not the different vehicles, they are not
            apprehended, they are without marks, and they are not completely isolated. They know
            that they are inexpressible, without avarice, utterly peaceful, free from momentary
            apprehension, utterly extinguished, groundless, utterly tranquil, utterly devoid of
            object, utterly without beneficence, and completely rootless. They know that they are
            not the sense faculties, they are utterly impure, and they are completely separate,
            utterly without antidote, devoid of marks and insubstantial, not at all stolen, utterly
            diffuse, and utterly insubstantial with respect to all phenomena. On this understanding,

            This is the basis of their defining characteristic, the characteristic they have in
            common, their single characteristic, and bodhisattvas regard all things as grounded in
            the absence of a defining characteristic. They regard all phenomena, including all the
            formations and everything that is experienced in the three times, as grounded in
            suchness. Moreover, since the nourishment given by the bodhisattvas spreads to all

            that perception that clings to elaborations, there is a perception of pride and a

            at the lowest stage should practice the six perfections. When they cultivate all manner

            the eye and forms have ceased, the eye consciousness will cease. When the eye
            consciousness has ceased, everything up to this great mass of suffering will also cease.
            In the same way, contact occurs when three factors come together after the mental
            consciousness has arisen conditioned by the ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, and mental
            phenomena. Everything from feelings to this great mass of suffering arises due to the
            condition of contact. When the mind has ceased, mental phenomena will cease, and the
            mental consciousness will cease. When the mental consciousness has ceased, contact will

            After bodhisattvas attain liberation from all manner of rebirths there is no birth, no
            old age, no death, and no origination, and they become like the nature of mind. By
            taking on bodies in all of the buddha realms they appear as reflections of the moon in
            water. They take on various physical forms, complexions, marks, and shapes to teach the

            profound qualities of a buddha. If only this acceptance becomes completely clear to the
            ears of the bodhisattvas, their minds will dwell on the momentariness of all formations.

            self, all the way up to not apprehending persons. They will act in accordance with what
            they have said and be benevolent. Since they completely understand all phenomena, their
            minds will no longer regress. Since they do not commit any negative actions, their minds
            will be virtuous. Since they carry the burden of all beings, they have a vast intention.
            Since they satiate all the beings in the lower realms, they have an attitude of great
            love. Since they do not wish for other vehicles, their minds are at peace. Since they
            clear away the stains of the afflictions, their minds will be devoid of afflictions.
            Since they are naturally luminous, their minds will be luminous. Since they pursue the

            donned the saffron robes, and became a renunciant out of sincere faith in the presence

            apprehend anything that dwells in the realm of phenomena. I do not see name and form. I
            cannot see the characteristics of form, which are mere labels. The same goes for
            feelings, perceptions, and formations. Respected Blessed One, I do not see the

            consciousnesses of the three times. Blessed One, I do not see the ultimate reality of
            the eye related to the three times; the characteristics of the eye, which are mere
            verbal designations; the collection of the internal mental faculty related to the three
            times; or contact that is pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
            Respected Blessed One, I do not apprehend arising, abiding, and disintegrating as being

            characteristics superimposed on space, they are without coming and going, and they are
            not apprehended in any way. All phenomena are like optical illusions, mirages, dreams,

                                <tei:p>The sūtra tradition speaks of three levels of intellectual
                receptivity or acceptance of the Dharma. At the highest level is “the acceptance
                of the fact that things do not arise” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">anutpattikadharmakṣānti</foreign>), which is tantamount to an acceptance of the
                  emptiness of all things, the fact that they do not arise or cease as substantial
                  or essentially real phenomena. This level follows from a second level of
                  acceptance, which brings one into conformity with the Dharma (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ānulomika­dharmakṣānti</foreign>). This second level is in
                  turn preceded by a first stage of acceptance in which one follows the voice
                    (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ghoṣānugā kṣānti</foreign>) of the teacher of the
                  Dharma. This is a distinctive but related use of the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kṣānti</foreign>, which is also translated in this sūtra as
                “patience,” when it refers to the perfection and virtue of “patience” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kṣānti</foreign>) more generally.</tei:p>
