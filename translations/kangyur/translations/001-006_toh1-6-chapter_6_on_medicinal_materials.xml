                    the corpus of monastic law of one of the most influential Buddhist schools in India. This chapter deals with monastic regulations
                    about medicines. At the same time, it also includes various <term>elements</term> not restricted to such rules: stories of the
                    Buddha and his disciples, a lengthy story of the Buddha’s journey for the purpose of quelling an epidemic and converting a nāga, a
                    number of stories of the Buddha’s former lives narrated by the Buddha himself, and a series of verses recited by the Buddha and
                    his disciples about their former lives. Thus, this chapter preserves not only interesting information about medical knowledge

                        and its Vinaya, the corpus of monastic law, is reported to have circulated not only in various parts of the Indian

                    <p tid="15">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinayavastu</title> is one of the four divisions of this voluminous Vinaya and is a collection of seventeen thematic
                        chapters, each of which deals with monastic rules about a specific topic such as ordination, clothing, and so on. Among these
                        chapters, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhaiṣajyavastu</title> is the lengthiest (in the Tibetan translation) or the second
                        lengthiest (in the Sanskrit manuscript). As is indicated by its title, this chapter is concerned with rules about medicines to
                        be used and foods to be eaten by monastics. Actually, however, most of the text is not related to any such rules, at least not
                        directly; accounts of rules are concentrated mostly in the first and last parts of the chapter, which together make up less
                        than 20 percent of the entire chapter, and the rest of the text is filled with various narrative stories about the Buddha and
                        other characters, and stories of their former lives. Many parallels to sūtras, which present doctrines rather than monastic
                        law, are also included in this chapter. Thus, it not only provides interesting information about medical knowledge shared by
                        ancient Indian Buddhist monastics but is also a vast treasure trove of Buddhist narrative literature, and it even opens a
                        number of doors to another canonical corpus, the Sūtrapiṭaka of the Mūla­sarvāstivādins, most of which is lost today. The
                        abundance of narrative <term type="ignore">elements</term> and sūtras is characteristic of the law code of the
                        Mūla­sarvāstivādins as a whole, and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhaiṣajyavastu</title> is outstanding in this regard. </p>

                    <p tid="16">The outline of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhaiṣajyavastu</title> based on the Tibetan version is as follows. The
                        chapter opens with an account of the Buddha’s permission for monks to use medicines, and explanations of various medicines
                        follow. After the account of permission to boil almsfood that is not completely cooked, however, the text suddenly begins to
                        narrate the biography of Pūrṇa, a disciple of the Buddha. After this story ends, another unrelated story begins, explaining
                        how the city of Rājagṛha was endangered by a nāga king named Apalāla. In this story, at the request of the citizens of Vaiśālī
                        and King Ajātaśatru of Magadha, the Buddha leaves Rājagṛha and journeys with his disciples to quell an epidemic in Vaiśālī and
                        convert the nāga king, who lives in the northern region. The first part of this journey generally corresponds to the Buddha’s
                        final journey as narrated in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­parinirvāṇa­sūtra</title> in the Dīrghāgama. However, in this
                        text the story develops differently from the sūtra after the Buddha quells the epidemic in Vaiśālī, the first destination.
                        Although he hints at his approaching nirvāṇa, the Buddha travels to Kuśinagarī <emph>without</emph> entering the city of Pāpā,
                        which is an important place in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­parinirvāṇa­sūtra</title>.<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh119.html"/> In the end, the Buddha does not enter nirvāṇa in the story in the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Bhaiṣajyavastu</title>. Various episodes are narrated regarding each place the Buddha visits, and
                        sometimes they appear quite jumbled—the Buddha even “arrives” at Rājagṛha, the starting point of the journey, before he
                        reaches the northern region, that is, his second destination. The Buddha flies through the air from a place named Rohitaka to
                        the northern region, converts the nāga king Apalāla, returns, and continues traveling. In Śrāvastī, answering a question of
                        King Prasenajit of Kosala, the Buddha narrates many stories of his former lives. Then the Buddha and his five hundred
                        disciples visit Lake Anavatapta by means of their magical power, and there each of the disciples recites verses about his
                        former lives, as does the Buddha, after which they return to Śrāvastī. The story of their journey continues until Vaiśālī.
                        After an episode in Vaiśālī, accounts of various rules follow, which seem not to be related to the preceding story but to be
                        simply a list of episodes relevant to rules. The chapter closes with an account of a monk who is bitten by a poisonous snake
                        and then saved by the Buddha with a charm, accompanied by two stories about the former lives of the Buddha and the monk.</p>

                                    Buddha in the Bhv is specified here. Erich Frauwallner argues that it is clear that the episode in the Bhv where
                                    the Buddha flew from Rohitaka to the north (<ptr target="#UT22084-001-006-chapter-7-10"/>) is a later
                                    interpolation into the story of his travels in Mathurā (Frauwallner 1956, 31–33). However, when we look at the
                                    larger context of the Bhv, we find the purpose of his going to the north clearly shown here, long before the
                                    Rohitaka episode. If the Buddha’s flight to the north is to be considered a later interpolation, as Frauwallner
                                    says, then the episode here, in which King Ajātaśatru requests the Buddha to go to the north, would also have to

                                positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.<!--modules ends-->”</p>

                                problematic here. A few lines below, the Mallas ask the Buddha with what power he smashed the rock into pieces, and
                                the Buddha’s answer is “magical power” in Tib. and Skt. (NBhv), and “the power of meditation” in Ch. The Mallas later
                                ask if there is any other power besides the power generated from one’s father and mother, <distinct>the power of
                                    meditation</distinct>, and the power of dedication. The Buddha then lists seven kinds of powers: the power
                                generated from one’s father and mother; <distinct>the power of meditation</distinct>, of dedication, of merit, and of
                                knowledge; <distinct>magical power</distinct>, and the power of impermanence, in this order. The position of magical
                                power, the sixth, cannot be mistaken, because an episode from the Buddha’s life story is mentioned regarding the
                                Buddha’s defeat of non-Buddhist ascetics with his magical power. Thus, there seems to be some confusion in Tib., Skt.,
                                and Ch. here, and “the power of meditation” rather than “magical power” is likely to be appropriate in context. The

                                daughters. Suprabuddha is Śuddhā’s son, which means that Suprabuddha is the Buddha’s cousin, since <term type="ignore">Śuddhodana</term> is the Buddha’s father (SbhvG i 31–32; ga F.272.b–273.a<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh1-17.html"/>; Taishō no. 1450, 24.105a). However, shortly after this
                                account, the Sbhv tells us that King Suprabuddha in Devadṛśa, wishing to be related to King Siṃhahanu by marriage,
                                marries his daughters Māyā and Mahāmāyā to Prince <term type="ignore">Śuddhodana</term> (SbhvG i 33–35; ga

                                This second account naturally suggests that King Suprabuddha is the Buddha’s maternal grandfather. Though it may not
                                be utterly impossible for one’s grandfather to also be one’s cousin (i.e., his mother married her granduncle), these
                                two accounts may refer to two people of the same name, or they may represent two different narrative traditions that
                                were carelessly combined. Furthermore, the Pāli tradition gives a completely different story, which explains that
                                Suppabuddha was Māyā’s brother, married Sīhahanu’s daughter, and had the children Bhaddakaccānā (the Buddha’s wife and
                                mother of Rāhula) and Devadatta (DPPN s.v. 1. Suppabuddha). In this case, Suppabuddha is the Buddha’s uncle and

                                abbreviated here with the expression “as stated above” in Tib., there is no such passage before this in the Bhv. In
                                Ch., in contrast, the passage in question is not abbreviated but narrated in full. There is an interesting
                                correspondence between Tib., Bhv, and SĀc; in SĀc 807, this passage is abbreviated, too, and we see the passage
                                narrated in full in SĀc 803. It is thus clear that the redactors of the MSV at some stage inserted a sūtra from the
                                Saṃyuktāgama available to them here in the Bhv, with the abbreviation in the sūtra as it was. The text of Ch. suggests
                                a more careful editorial operation, that is, the supplementation of the abbreviation. The difference between these two
                                versions may be explained in two ways: the insertion of the sūtra with the abbreviation as seen in Tib. came first,
                                and some later redactor found the passage intelligible and filled in the abbreviation; alternatively, there was only a
                                brief reference to the Saṃyuktāgama in this part of the Bhv at an early stage, and later, when the textual
                                transmission had branched off, redactors belonging to each tradition incorporated the sūtra from the Saṃyuktāgama at
                                their own discretion, one doing it carelessly (as seen in Tib.) and another attentively (as seen in Ch.). For further

                                interpretation, the Pāli word <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">samārambha</foreign> in the DN should be
                                interpreted as “injuring, killing” (PTSD, q.v.). However, this interpretation does not apply to its counterpart here,

                                beds, etc. Therefore the word has to be interpreted in its supposedly more common meaning of “undertaking, doing,
                                effort” (MW, PTSD, Jäschke, q.v.), and the whole sentence may be translated as follows: “Ambāṣṭha, some

                                of meaning with the word “injuring” here. Perhaps the meaning “injuring” of the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">samārambha</foreign> was lost at some stage in the textual transmission, and the word was
                                reinterpreted as “effort” and then combined with the following words: <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">-anuyogaṃ anuyuktā viharanti</foreign>. </note> namely, those that grow from roots,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-006-1738"> Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">rtsa ba’i sa bon</foreign> (lit., “seed of

                                “Then I was praised by him with a single verse, and he was put in five excellent villages by me.” This could be
                                interpreted in another way, as Rotman does, separating the first-person pronoun <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mayā</foreign> (“by me”) in the second half of the sentence and the agent of the past passive participle <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pratiṣṭhāpitaḥ</foreign> (“put, established”) so as to resolve the above problem:
                                “Back then he praised me with a single verse, and I caused him to be put in charge of five excellent villages” (Rotman
                                2008–17, i 148). So too could Tib. be interpreted: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">ngas ’di la grong mchog
                                    lnga byin no</foreign>, “Because of me, five excellent villages were given to him” (?). However, in both versions
                                the first-person pronoun seems more likely to indicate the agent of the verb. Ch. explicitly presents this
                                “contradictory” interpretation: <foreign xml:lang="zh" type="quote">我賜與五聚落</foreign>, “I bestowed five villages [on

                                    abbreviation in Skt. In Ch. here, the brahmin is said to “rejoice” in the Buddha’s words and depart from the
                                    presence of the Buddha. The same thing is also stated in AKUp 9005 and SN 48.42, concluding or nearly concluding
                                    each sūtra (a concluding remark by the Buddha follows this in the SN version). However, the expression “rejoiced
                                    in the Buddha’s words,” a very common ending of sūtras and therefore natural in the AKUp and SN versions,
                                    obviously contradicts the following development of the story in the Bhv in which the brahmin makes a malicious
                                    wish about the Buddha. It is likely that the redactors of the Bhv at some stage noticed the need to delete the
                                    concluding sentence of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Otalāyanasūtra</title> for consistency and actually did so,
                                    hence the absence of the expression “rejoiced in the Buddha’s words” in Tib. In contrast, Ch. here seems to
                                    represent an earlier stage of textual transmission in which this sentence was carelessly preserved, or to suggest
                                    separate insertion of the sūtra in different textual lineages. Cf. Yao forthcoming a. </note>

                                wished to go forth; that karma matured to cause her to go forth after she became old. When I gave a donation, she
                                interfered; because of this, she became poor. She did not perform great actions that would generate the great power of
                                merit as Mahāmāyā did; therefore, I did not enter her womb for my last birth. Having gone forth in the presence of the
                                Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, she uttered the words ‘slave woman’ against nuns, both those who were practitioners
                                undergoing training and those who were practitioners having completed training; therefore, she became a female slave.
                                There, through recitation and repetition, she became familiar with the aggregates, spheres, and elements, dependent
                                origination, and what is proper and what is improper; therefore, she abandoned all the defilements and actualized the

                                the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa as the best of those who analyzed the sūtras, this woman made this aspiration at

                                    inconsistency in the latter, it seems likely that the former life story of Dharmadinnā is rather an insertion made

                                    king’s promise to provide food for them, has parallels in different vinayas and other sources. Hirakawa has noted
                                    that the story’s subject and location in vinaya s differ: in the Pāli Vinaya, the <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Sifen
                                        lü</title> (Dharmaguptaka Vinaya), and the <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Wufen lü</title> (Mahīśāsaka Vinaya), this
                                    story is located in the introductory section of the entire vinaya as the account of the event that caused the
                                    Buddha to declare the general principle that each regulation should be established only after some practical
                                    problem has arisen. In the <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Shisong lü</title> (the so-called Sarvāstivāda Vinaya) and the
                                    MSV (Bhv), utterly unrelated to the above principle, the story is focused on a karmic teaching about the Buddha’s
                                    evil action in his former life and its result in the present (Hirakawa 1993–95, i 107–115). The following is the
                                    plot of these parallels (proper names, etc., based on the Bhv): 1. The Buddha arrives at Vairambhya (Pā; Si; Wu;
                                    Shi; Bhv). 2. A brahmin (king) asks the Buddha questions (Pā = AN 8.11; MĀc 157, etc.). 3. The brahmin (king)
                                    offers food, etc., for the rainy-season retreat (Pā; Si; Wu; Shi; Bhv). 4. The brahmin fails to carry out the
                                    above offer and the Buddha and monks experience difficulty in obtaining food (Pā; Si; Wu; Shi; Bhv). 5. A caravan
                                    leader offers horse-fodder barley to the Buddha (Pā; Si; Wu; Shi; Bhv). 6. Mahā­maudgalyāyana offers to resolve
                                    the matter using his magical power, but the Buddha refuses (Pā; Si; Wu; Shi = EĀc 42.3; MPS 31.56–83<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh119.html"/>). 7. A woman cooks the barley (Shi;
                                    Bhv = SĀc 722 [parallel only to Bhv]). 8. Śāriputra requests the Buddha to establish the rules of training, but
                                    the Buddha refuses (Pā; Si; Wu). 9. Only after the rainy-season retreat, the brahmin (king) realizes that the food
                                    has not been provided. He repents and offers food to the Buddha (Pā; Wu; Shi; Bhv). Park 2012 also gives a
                                    comparison of the parallel stories. For another parallel, see Rosen 1959, 165–68. </note>

                                    sūtra of the Chapter Connected to Kings [in the Madhyamāgama]” (Honjō 2014, i 467ff.). It is unclear which sūtra
                                    this reference in the AKUp indicates: Honjō, mentioning the identification of AKUp 3098 with MĀc 70, <title xml:lang="zh">轉輪王經</title>
                                    <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Zhuanlunwangjing</title> (The Sūtra of the Wheel-Turning King) by other scholars, notes
                                    that AKUp 3098 corresponds more literally to MĀc 67, the <title xml:lang="Zh-Ltn">Datiannailinjing</title>
                                    <title xml:lang="zh">大天㮈林經</title> (The Sūtra of Mahādeva’s Mango Grove) rather than to MĀc 70. The problem is the
                                    fact that the sūtra about King Mahādeva, parallel to MĀc 67, is quoted as “the twelfth sūtra in the Chapter
                                    Connected to Kings” in AKUp 2050. Honjō suggests possible confusion of “second” with “twelfth.” However, there is
                                    another problem: although MĀc 67 gives a full explanation of the seven treasures of a wheel-turning king, this
                                    explanation is abbreviated in both Mūla­sarvāstivādin parallels to the sūtra, i.e., AKUp 2050 and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahādevasūtra</title> in the Bhv, Chapter Four, <ptr target="#UT22084-001-006-chapter-4-3"/><!--III. Mithilā-->). It is possible that the Mūla­sarvāstivādin version of the Madhyamāgama did have a sūtra
                                    that included the description of the precious chakra (or all seven treasures) as the second sūtra of the Chapter

                                    AKUp does not mention any sūtra title, it is likely to be quoting a sūtra, not the vinaya, since the relevant part

                                commentary (Ingalls 1951, 186). He also noted that the name <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ācāmanadī</foreign> was assumed
                                to originate in <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">*Cāmannadī</foreign>, a Prākṛt form of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Carmaṇvatī</foreign>, the name of a river that arose from a heap of skins on the occasion when King Rantideva
                                performed a great sacrifice in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata</title>. According to Ingalls, the Buddhist
                                storyteller of King Piṇḍavaṃśa’s tale created the story from the famous story of King Rantideva, using the character
                                of the brahmin Velāma, who was well known for his lavish donations, and changing an animal sacrifice into an offering
                                of water used for boiling rice. Ingalls also inferred this storyteller’s ignorance about Sanskrit from the etymology
                                mentioned above and the existence of “an ancient non-Sanskrit, non Pāli-source” preceding the MSV.</note>

                                    Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya to originate from an old common source, Gregory Schopen proposed the opposite view,
                                    introducing the stories in the Bhv and Divy ([1985] 1997, 28–29). Schopen regarded this version in the Bhv and
                                    Divy as an old account preceding the other parallel stories, based on his observations that the version does not
                                    have the subplots found in the other versions and knows nothing about a stūpa at Toyikā, only about relics.

                                    it was to hang out clothes (to dry?)” (BHSD, q.v.). Rotman translates this word in another way: “a woman dependent
                                    on a city for alms,” and he makes its meaning clearer in his subheading: “The Venerable Mahākāśyapa and a Leprous
                                    Beggar Woman” (2008–17, i 162–63). He notes that the term seems to be the converse of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">gocaragrāma</foreign> (“sustenance village, a village where food is supplied to monks,” BHSD, s.v.

                                    Rotman’s translation for the following reasons. First, both Tib. and Ch. translate the word as “beggar” in this
                                    story in the Bhv. Second, there is no mention of washing in the story, but the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nagarāvalambikā</foreign> is said to obtain water used for boiling rice “by begging.” (This water,
                                    Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ācāma</foreign>, seems to be something usually not to be drunk but to

                                        between these two sets of stories seems to be mainly due to the editorial transformation of their common

                                        sermon to King Prasenajit, which we are now reading. The first set of stories seems to preserve the exact

                                        King Mahādeva in this story—the story has been about the king’s going forth and leading the pure life. As well
                                        as this inconsistency, this passage, the sentence and following verses about offerings, has another problem:
                                        it is unclear which “Mahādeva” is speaking the verses here—the first one, his son, or the eighty-four
                                        thousandth Mahādeva. The first option is the most likely, but then it is somewhat strange that the verses
                                        appear after the reference to the descendants of the first Mahādeva. This passage appears neither in another
                                        story of Mahādeva in the Bhv nor in any of the parallel stories such as MN 83, etc., but connects to the
                                        typical concluding passage “Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these
                                        donations . . . ,” which is common to many stories in the Buddha’s sermon to King Prasenajit in the Bhv.
                                        Therefore, the most likely explanation of the problems concerning the passage about offerings mentioned above
                                        is that it was combined with the text of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahādevasūtra</title> at some editorial
                                        stage of the Bhv so that the story about Mahādeva’s going forth in the Madhyamāgama was transformed into a
                                        story about donations, which would match the context of the sermon to Prasenajit in the Bhv.</note>

                                        independent sūtra narrating the story of Nimi in the lost Madhyamāgama of the Mūla­sarvāstivādins. Judging
                                        from Ch.’s statement about the abbreviation of another set of stories of Mahādeva and Nimi in the Bhv, it is
                                        certain that this Madhyamāgama had a sūtra entitled <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahādevasūtra</title> in which
                                        the stories of Mahādeva and Nimi were combined, similar to its parallels in the MĀc and MN. Therefore, it is
                                        most likely that what is abbreviated here is the second half of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahādevasūtra</title>, the first half of which has already appeared in the preceding section. It should
                                        be noted, too, that Ch. does not refer to the specific title of a sūtra, either here or in the preceding
                                        section, whereas it gives the title “Mahādeva” when it abbreviates the story in its other occurrence in the

Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">srog chags</foreign> (“living being”) corresponds to NBhv <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prāṇī</foreign>. However, Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ngur pa</foreign> (“the red wild duck”) does not match <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">utkrośa</foreign> (“osprey”), which both NBhv and the Divy give, but rather indicates <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">cakravāka</foreign>, as Shackleton-Bailey suggests and as is attested in

                                            of the absence of support in Sanskrit materials, referring to cakravāka makes perfect sense in this
                                            context, as a pair of this kind of bird is said to carry on a conversation at night when they are apart
                                            from each other (Dave 2005, 450–51, where <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">cakravāka</foreign> is
                                            identified with “the Ruddy Sheldrake” (Shelduck)). The present translator previously suggested in a
                                            footnote to her Japanese translation that <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ngur pa</foreign> should
                                            be read as the verb <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ngur ba</foreign> (“to grunt”) on the basis of
                                            the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">utkrośa</foreign> (“outcry”), regarding <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">srog chags ngur ba</foreign> (“beings making a noise”) as a translation
                                            of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">utkrośaḥ prāṇī</foreign> found in NBhv (BhvY 361n4). However,
                                            there remains a possibility that the Skt. original of Tib. read <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">cakravāka</foreign>. Given the strong association of the context and the characteristic of cakravāka
                                            mentioned above, it could have happened that <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">cakravāka</foreign>
                                            replaced <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">utkrośa</foreign> at some stage in the textual
                                            transmission. A development in the opposite direction, however, seems less likely. Hence, the present
                                            translation simply takes the meaning of the Tibetan word. As for the fourth item, the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ra bgo</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">go</foreign> is
                                            unclear to the present translator, who therefore had to treat it as a translation of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">senāpati</foreign>. However, the word <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">senāpati</foreign> (“the general of an army”) seems somewhat strange for indicating the
                                            chief of thieves. It is worth noting that Ch. “The third is a person committing thievery. The fourth is
                                            the general of an army” seems to take <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prāṇī</foreign> to be related

                                            of the act of punishing and the gatekeeper/gatekeepers as its object, whereas Tib. gives the gatekeepers
                                            as the agent and “me,” the prince himself, as the object. Cf. Shackleton-Bailey 1951, 96; Hiraoka 2007, ii
                                            257n262. The two verbs surviving in NBhv agree with Tib., whereas the Divy gives only the first verb.
                                            However, the verb form is singular in NBhv, unlike in Tib., where the agent is clearly plural. Therefore,
                                            there are at least two possible readings for NBhv, i.e., “the king will destroy or kill the gatekeepers”
                                            and “the gatekeeper will destroy or kill me.” </note> I will now go by any means along the path where

                                            is notable that Viś III Tib. agrees with the Bhv against Viś III Skt. in both the gender of the names and

                                            with Viś III Skt. and Viś IV, but Pāli sources explicitly state that the prince carries the son and his

On the other hand,
                                            according to Dave, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kurara</foreign> can mean various species of

Dave quotes from the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Buddhacarita</title> 8.51 the example “distressed as if a <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">kurarī</foreign> who lost a chick,” which is quite similar to the simile in the present

                                    times, and were reborn as members of the Brahmā World. Among those who were not entirely disciplined and
                                    perfected, some were reborn as gods of Nirmāṇarati, some as gods of Tuṣita, and some as members of the gods of the

                                    The young brahmins again thought, ‘Certainly, the Master has accomplished his vow. <ref cRef="F.263.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-001-006-8420"/> Thus, he speaks with a deer.’ Having again thought this, they

                                One’s thoughts. The nāga kings Nanda and Upananda therefore wondered, “Why did the Blessed One entertain mundane

                                Anavatapta. And so, in the middle of the great lake Anavatapta they created a lotus blossom with a thousand petals,
                                which was as large as the wheel of a chariot, beautiful, and made entirely of gold, and whose stalk was made of
                                jewels, whose filaments were made of diamonds, and which was surrounded by thousands of other lotus blossoms. The
                                Blessed One sat in the center of the lotus blossom before the community of monks. The monks who were the most
                                venerable of the elders also sat in the centers of the other lotus blossoms.</p>

                                            land of abundance where planting and cultivation were unknown and food was there for the taking. But even
                                            with these difficulties the basic sense of the text seems clear enough: monks are normally forbidden to
                                            take or eat what has not been explicitly given or rendered ‘proper’ or suitable . . .” (2018, 382–83). The

                                            do say, “Please help yourself.” Since it is said in Vinaya texts that there is no possession of anything
                                            in Uttarakuru and consequently no stealing (Kishino 2017, esp. 242–43), deciding that it is “the time of
                                            Kuru in the north” may mean deciding that one is in some exceptional situation in which one is exempted

                                    the two nāgas escaped underground. Later, after Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa had sought refuge in the Perfectly Awakened
                                    One Kāśyapa and accepted the rules of training, the garuḍas again began to attack these two, but they were
                                    obstructed and repulsed, just as wind and water are obstructed and repulsed by Mount Sumeru. The two garuḍas then
                                    inquired of them, ‘Sirs, when we attacked you before, you used to escape underground. Why, when we meet you now,
                                    are we obstructed and repulsed, just as wind and water are obstructed and repulsed by Mount Sumeru? What is the
                                    cause of this?’</p>
