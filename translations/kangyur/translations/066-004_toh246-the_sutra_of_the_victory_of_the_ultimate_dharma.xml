                    the Buddha, in which countless living beings are emitted from the Buddha in the form of rays of
                    light. Although this miraculous display awes the bodhisattvas and gods who are present, Ulka is not
                    swayed by these powers, arguing that non-Buddhist gods such as Nārāyaṇa and Maheśvara are also able
                    to perform such feats. In answering his questions, the Buddha articulates core teachings of Buddhism
                    such as impermanence, karma, and emptiness.</p>

                        miraculous displays. A bodhisattva called Victorious Heap is about to ask the bodhisattva
                        Mañjughoṣa (Mañjuśrī) to explain the significance of these displays when he is unexpectedly
                        interrupted by the non-Buddhist seer Ulka, who is unimpressed with the Buddha’s display of
                        miracles and decides to test his omniscience. Ulka therefore proceeds to ask a series of
                        questions concerning the origin of life, the end of the universe, and the nature of the
                        soul.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-066-004-8"/>
                    <p tid="11">In answering these questions, the Buddha presents several core Buddhist doctrines. Regarding the
                        origin of life, the Buddha states that “the origin of sentient beings is inexpressible.”
                        Concerning the end of the universe, he states that it will come because “everything is
                        impermanent.” As for the various realms of existence in saṃsāra, beings are born into them due
                        to their karma. The soul, moreover, does not exist because it cannot be observed anywhere, and
                        therefore sentient beings themselves do not truly exist. The text concludes with a scene in
                        which Ulka—and all the other non-Buddhists in attendance—become the Buddha’s followers. Finally, the Buddha
                        prophesies that Ulka will become a buddha in the future named Vipaśyin, and he entrusts this
                        discourse to Mañjuśrī. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-066-004-9"/>
                    <p tid="12">An interesting feature of this sūtra is the presence of many non-Buddhist ascetics, who are
                        described as naked, with matted hair, emaciated bellies, and so forth. Moreover, the central
                        interlocutor of this sūtra is a non-Buddhist seer, Ulka, whose questions to the Buddha also seem
                        to be founded in non-Buddhist cosmological views. It is therefore also fitting that the setting
                        of this sūtra is Gayāśīrṣa Hill, a brahmanical holy site referred to in texts such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Brahmāṇḍa­purāṇa</title> and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahābhārata</title>. For Buddhists, this hill is also a sacred site as the venue where the Buddha taught the Dharma after he had brought to the Buddhist path the three ascetic Kāśyapa brothers and a thousand of their followers, likewise through a series of miracles. In this sūtra, however, the
                        Buddha’s miraculous display is not sufficient to assuage Ulka’s doubts, and his questions to the
                        Buddha serve as a launching point for the teaching of important Buddhist concepts.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-066-004-10"/>
                    <p tid="13">Non-Buddhist ideas are clearly reflected in this sūtra. First of all, as part of the Buddha’s
                        miraculous displays, he emits lights that constitute countless living beings, including the
                        higher castes of the kṣatriyas and brahmans. This is somewhat reminiscent of how the body of the
                        Vedic god Prajāpati, the Lord of Creatures, is the source of human beings of different castes.
                        Secondly, in a question reminiscent of Śiva’s role as the destroyer of creation, Ulka asks the
                        Buddha why the world will be destroyed by fire at the end of the eon, and in an ambiguous
                        passage the Buddha answers that the buddhas do not needlessly “bring forth” the apocalyptic
                        fire. Lastly, in the end the ascetic Ulka swears to pursue the Buddha’s omniscience in a manner
                        suited to an ascetic, promising to do so even if he has to abide in a pit, jump off a mountain,
                        be tormented, be roasted by the sun, or fast for eons. </p>

                        In the Tibetan translation the colophon states that it was translated by the Indian preceptors
                        Jinamitra and Dānaśīla together with the Tibetan editor-translator Yeshé Dé, all of whom
                        flourished during the late eighth and early ninth century. This dating is confirmed by the
                        text’s inclusion in the Denkarma catalog of Tibetan imperial translations, which is dated to 812

                        What we call a sentient being is one who is born from the condition of ignorance and who
                        persists until old age and death. Great Seer, alternatively, one can say that a sentient being
                        is born from causes and conditions, and those causes and conditions are the parents. Great Seer,
                        the union of the parents is the cause. And whenever there is entry into the body of a woman
                        caused by the karmic winds, themselves impelled by concepts, that is the condition.</p>

                            that the tathāgatas are actually causing the apocalyptic fire. J. S. Negi’s <title xml:lang="en">Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary</title> has several pertinent renderings of
                                <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’byin pa</foreign>. For example, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">niścar</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pramuñc</foreign> both carry the connotation of bringing something forth or
                            about through an emittance. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Uddharaṇa</foreign> and
                            its associated verb <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uddhṛ</foreign> refer to a brand
                            used to transfer fire from one sacrificial fire to another. The related <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’byin pa po</foreign> renders as <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">sraṣtṛ</foreign>, the creator of the universe. These
                            connotations may create a more theistic image of the Tathāgata that is not generally
                            accepted in Tibetan Mahāyāna Buddhism. However, there are several reasons internal to the
                            text that suggest this reading: (1) Ulka’s original question asks why the world will be
                            destroyed by fire, not why the tathāgatas <emph>teach</emph> about the destruction. The
                            object of <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’byin pa</foreign> in the Tibetan is always
                            the destruction proper, with no mention of its teaching. (2) The subsequent passages, via
                            the gold analogy, describe the destruction of the world itself as beneficial, not the
                            teaching as beneficial, and that the tathāgatas are the agents of this benefit. (3) The
                            destruction of the world by a deity is central to brahmanical cosmology, elements of which
                            the Buddha seems to incorporate in answering Ulka’s questions. (4) The reassurance that no
                            being is harmed by the fire suggests that the Tathāgata would be responsible if some being
                            were harmed, also suggesting the Tathāgata is the agent of the fire. However, one of the
                            translation equivalents of <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’byin pa</foreign> is
                                <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">udbhid</foreign>, which can mean “to mention,” so
                            the theistic interpretation is not definitive. Keeping in mind the Mahāyāna notion of
                            skillful means, the language here may be intentionally ambiguous to suit the metaphysical
                            suppositions of a brahmanical audience. Thus, the equally ambiguous “bring forth” seems the
