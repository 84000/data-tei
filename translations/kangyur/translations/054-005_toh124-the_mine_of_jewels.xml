        <p tid="2">In this sūtra the Buddha Śākyamuni recounts how the thus-gone Sarvārthasiddha purified the buddha
          realms in his domain. In his explanation, the Buddha Śākyamuni emphasizes the view of the Great Vehicle, which
          he explains as the fundamental basis for all bodhisattvas who aspire to attain liberation. The attendant
          topics taught by the Buddha are the six perfections of generosity, discipline, patience, diligence,
          concentration, and <term>wisdom</term>. The Buddha explains each of these six perfections in three distinct
          ways as he recounts the past lives of the buddha Sarvārthasiddha. First, he describes how Sarvārthasiddha
          learned the practices that purify buddha realms, namely the six perfections. Next, he explains how to seal
          these six virtuous practices with the correct view so that they become perfections. Finally, he recounts how
          Sarvārthasiddha, as a bodhisattva, received instructions for enhancing the potency of the perfections.</p>

          <p tid="8">
                        <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel Mine</title> is a Great Vehicle sūtra in which the Buddha Śākyamuni
            is requested by Mañjuśrī and others to explain how buddha realms are purified, as
            bodhisattvas receive teachings from the buddhas and subsequently train on the bodhisattva path based on
            these instructions. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-4"/>
          <p tid="9">In replying to Mañjuśrī, the Buddha does not present the way he himself purified buddha realms.
            Instead, he recounts how a certain past buddha, Sarvārthasiddha, purified infinite buddha realms as a
            bodhisattva prior to his awakening. This story originates with Dīpaṅkara, the buddha who is said to have
            prophesied the Buddha Śākyamuni’s awakening. According to <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel Mine</title>,
            Dīpaṅkara told this story to the Buddha Śākyamuni to inspire him and to spur him on the path to awakening.
            By revealing how he himself received the story, Śākyamuni thus indicates the importance and relevance of
            studying the purification of buddha realms as a means to inspire fortitude in aspiring bodhisattvas. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-5"/>
          <p tid="10">The overarching principle in <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel Mine</title> is the understanding that
            there have been innumerable buddhas before the Buddha Śākyamuni, and that there will be an infinite number
            of buddhas after him, each presiding over their individual buddha realms. Long before their full awakening,
            buddhas-to-be pledge to awaken and teach beings the paths to liberation. In this way the path followed by
            all bodhisattvas is the same: it starts with generating the mind of awakening. Then, according to 
            <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel Mine</title>, as the bodhisattva subsequently trains in purifying buddha realms,
            the practice consists of training in the six perfections—generosity, discipline, patience, diligence,
            concentration, and <term>wisdom</term>. These common steps of the bodhisattva’s trajectory are all alluded
            to throughout the text. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-6"/>
          <p tid="11">Another important theme of <title xml:lang="en">The Jewel Mine</title> is aspirations. Such
            prayers, we are told, are central to all bodhisattva activities. According to the Great Vehicle, buddhas
            appear to sentient beings based on three causes: the buddhas’ compassion, the buddhas’ aspirations, and
            sentient beings’ merit. As a bodhisattva, it is therefore of crucial importance to engage in the practice of
            making aspirations. This sūtra describes the results of such aspirations accumulated from time without
            beginning. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-7"/>
          <p tid="12">The content of the text is structured in the following manner: first is a preliminary presentation
            of the setting of the sūtra, followed by the main presentation of the way the thus-gone Sarvārthasiddha
            purified buddha realms by relying on the six perfections. The Buddha Śākyamuni explains each of these six
            perfections in three distinct ways as he recounts the past lives of the buddha Sarvārthasiddha. First, he
            describes how Sarvārthasiddha learned the practices that purify buddha realms, namely the six perfections.
            Next, he explains how to seal these six virtuous practices with the correct view so that they become
            perfections. Finally, he recounts how Sarvārthasiddha as a bodhisattva received instructions for enhancing
            the potency of the perfections. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-8"/>
          <p tid="13">The Buddha Śākyamuni begins his teaching with a presentation of the view of emptiness that makes
            use of a variety of analogies. Realizing this view is also referred to as “experiencing liberation devoid of
            obscurations.” The Buddha explains that the way to train in purifying buddha realms is to realize this view:
            “Mañjuśrī, it is by experiencing liberation devoid of obscurations that the thus-gone Sarvārthasiddha
            purified his infinite, innumerable, inconceivable, incomparable, immeasurable, and inexpressibly vast buddha
            realms.” In this part of the sūtra, the Buddha shows how Sarvārthasiddha purified buddha realms throughout
            his previous lives, with each of the six perfections being the focus of a particular lifetime as a
            bodhisattva. First, we hear how the king Joyful and Wise accumulated merit through generosity. As he trained
            in discipline, he was the king Undefeated Army, while as a brahmin named Blazing Wit he developed the
            ability to maintain the view through patience. Next, we hear how Sarvārthasiddha’s practice of diligence
            unfolded in a life as the monk Dhṛtimati. He practiced the next perfection, that of concentration, in his
            life as the monk Pleasant Voice, who also developed unfailing memory as a quality of his concentration.
            Finally, he attained the perfection of <term>wisdom</term> as Megharāja, a former king turned monk. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-9"/>
          <p tid="14">In the second teaching, the practice of the six perfections is once again presented through six
            previous existences of the buddha Sarvārthasiddha. The first is his existence as Śāntamati, who was
            instructed by the buddha Sarvābhibhū to strive for buddhahood through the practice of generosity. The next
            incarnation of Sarvārthasiddha mentioned is the brahmin priest Viṣṇudatta, who practiced discipline. He is
            followed by the bodhisattva Always Looking, who perfected patience, the monk Sūrata, who perfected
            diligence, and the monk Concentrated Experience, who accomplished the perfection of concentration. Finally,
            as the monk Unsurpassed Wisdom he mastered the perfection of <term>wisdom</term>.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-10"/>
          <p tid="15">Then, for a third time, the Buddha Śākyamuni teaches the six perfections through the framework of
            six of Sarvārthasiddha’s other past lives. As the monk Careful Scrutiny he practiced generosity, and later
            as the wealthy kṣatriya layman Jagatīdhara he trained in discipline. Following this life, we hear of the
            monk Śāntamati, who practiced patience. Next, we are told how the bodhisattva Ārabdhavīrya strove in
            diligence, the brahmin priest Indradatta trained in aspirations, the brahmin priest Sandalwood Essence
            perfected skillful means, and finally how the bodhisattva Unsurpassed Knowledge realized the perfection of
              <term>wisdom</term>.</p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-11"/>
          <p tid="16">In the last part of the sūtra, the Buddha Śākyamuni reveals to Mañjuśrī the view of emptiness
            through a teaching on nonduality. As part of this concluding teaching, the Buddha also discloses the
            awakened feats of one of Mañjuśrī’s past lives as the brahmin Sūryadatta. Finally, in reply to a request by
            Mañjuśrī, the Buddha illustrates the long journey to buddhahood by telling how many buddhas Sarvābhibhū had
            followed and under whose guidance he had generated roots of virtue prior to his awakening, teaching in the
            process how a buddha is not someone limited to a single manifestation but a being capable of manifesting an
            inconceivable number of awakened emanations for the welfare of beings. </p>
          <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-12"/>
          <p tid="17">There is no extant Sanskrit version of this scripture, and the sūtra does not appear to have been
            translated into Chinese either. In producing this translation, we have therefore based our work on the Degé
            xylograph while consulting the Comparative Edition (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dpe bsdur ma</foreign>).
            Additionally, when the readings in the Degé and the Comparative Edition appeared problematic, we consulted
            the Stok Palace manuscript. The colophon of the sūtra states that it was translated from the Sanskrit by the
            Indian preceptors Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi along with the prolific Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé. Therefore,
            we can date the Tibetan translation to the late eighth to early ninth centuries, a dating that is also
            attested by the text’s inclusion in the early ninth century Denkarma (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar
              ma</foreign>) catalog.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-054-005-13"> The Denkarma catalog is

            that this is not the reality of phenomena. Śāntamati, consider the analogy of a man or a woman who is eating
            a meal. No one can convince them that they are not eating. This is because it would be obvious and cannot be
            any other way. Likewise, Śāntamati, when bodhisattvas abide within this intrinsic nature, no one can

            them that it is not the intrinsic nature of all phenomena—their knowledge is only due to direct experience

            as it is. They express eloquently the unborn and unceasing nature of phenomena as it is. They express
            eloquently how phenomena do not come or go. They express eloquently how phenomena do not die, do not
            transmigrate, and do not take rebirth. They express eloquently the way phenomena do not exist. They express
            eloquently how phenomena are not perceived and do not appear. They express eloquently how there are no
            explanations and that listening cannot be observed. They express eloquently the way actions do not exist and
            their karmic ripening does not exist. They express eloquently how saṃsāra does not exist and nirvāṇa cannot
            be observed. They express eloquently how there is absolutely no saṃsāra and how nothing can be observed
            transforming into nirvāṇa. They express eloquently how awakening and the attainment of awakening cannot be
            observed. They express eloquently how the defiled state does not exist and the purified state cannot be
            observed. They express eloquently how the attainment of qualities cannot be observed. They express
            eloquently how there is no abandonment of ordinary beings’ attributes and no attainment of the hearers’
            qualities. They express eloquently how there is no going beyond the qualities of the hearers and no
            attainment of the solitary buddhas’ qualities. They express eloquently how there is no going beyond the
            qualities of the solitary buddhas and how there is no attainment of the buddhas’ qualities. They express

            must maintain to accomplish awakening. Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings reflect on

            as the thus-gone ones of the past took hold of their body and mind and practiced generosity when they

            Mañjuśrī, this shows that bodhisattva great beings must acquire skillful means. In order for bodhisattvas to
            bring skillful means to perfection, it is necessary to teach them about the absorption that brings mastery
            over all phenomena. For bodhisattva great beings who rest in the absorption that brings mastery over all

            inexpressible vehicles. The blessed thus-gone Anantavīrya explained to them how he purified his infinite
