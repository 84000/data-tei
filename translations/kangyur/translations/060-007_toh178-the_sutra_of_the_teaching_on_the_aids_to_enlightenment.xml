                                        Śākyamuni first exposes the error that prevents sentient
                                        beings from transcending saṃsāra. The Buddha then goes on to
                                        offer insights into the skillful manner in which someone
                                        wishing to attain liberation should view the following five
                                        sets of qualities: (1) the four truths of the noble ones,
                                        (2) the four applications of mindfulness, (3) the eightfold

                                                The conversation between the Buddha and Mañjuśrī in
                                                this sūtra begins with a discussion of how one comes
                                                to be trapped in saṃsāra and how, with the aim of
                                                extricating oneself from this undesirable state, one
                                                should relate to various phenomena. Within this
                                                framework, the topic of the dialogue moves from the
                                                four truths to certain categories of the aids to
                                                enlightenment. In conclusion, the Buddha himself
                                                conveniently provides the following summary of the
                                                content of his teaching:</p>

                                                here comprise only four of the seven categories that

                                                instance, it cites the common formula, “suffering is

                                                ceasing,” and phenomena as devoid of “notions of
                                                them as wholes.” However, the sūtra uses these early

                                                of unenlightened existence. The traditional

                                                diverge quite considerably in the details, which can

                                                The two translations generally follow the same
                                                structure, although here too there are a few

                                                order of the seven categories of the aids to
                                                enlightenment, the Tibetan presents the eightfold

                                                the Buddha also teaches four kinds of effort and
                                                five kinds of power, two of the three categories
