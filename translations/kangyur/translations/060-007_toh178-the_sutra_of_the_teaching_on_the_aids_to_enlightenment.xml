                                <p>In response to a series of queries from Mañjuśrī, Buddha
                                        Śākyamuni first exposes the error that prevents sentient
                                        beings from transcending saṃsāra. The Buddha then goes on to
                                        offer insights into the skillful manner in which someone
                                        wishing to attain liberation should view the following five
                                        sets of qualities: (1) the four truths of the noble ones,
                                        (2) the four applications of mindfulness, (3) the eightfold
                                        path of the noble ones, (4) the five faculties, and (5) the
                                        seven branches of enlightenment.</p>

                                                in Buddhist scriptures, where it refers to a set of
                                                essential Buddhist practices. While its role in
                                                early Buddhist texts is particularly prominent, it
                                                also occupies an important place in Mahāyāna sūtras.
                                                Even in Buddhist tantric texts, we find explications
                                                of certain attributes of deities and maṇḍalas as
                                                symbolizing particular items that are included in

                                                  Enlightenment</title>, which is translated in the
                                                following pages, has a distinctive Mahāyānist tone.
                                                The conversation between the Buddha and Mañjuśrī in
                                                this sūtra begins with a discussion of how one comes
                                                to be trapped in saṃsāra and how, with the aim of
                                                extricating oneself from this undesirable state, one
                                                should relate to various phenomena. Within this
                                                framework, the topic of the dialogue moves from the
                                                four truths to certain categories of the aids to
                                                enlightenment. In conclusion, the Buddha himself
                                                conveniently provides the following summary of the
                                                content of his teaching:</p>

                                        <p>&lt;q&gt;Mañjuśrī, I proclaim anyone who sees the four
                                                truths of the noble ones, the four applications of
                                                mindfulness, the eightfold path of the noble ones,
                                                the five faculties, and the seven branches of
                                                enlightenment in such a manner to have crossed

                                        <p>Leaving aside the four truths of the noble ones, it is
                                                noteworthy that the four sets of qualities discussed
                                                here comprise only four of the seven categories that
                                                make up what is commonly known as the thirty-seven

                                                as follows: (1) four kinds of application of

                                                these foundational Buddhist teachings. In connection
                                                with the four truths of the noble ones, for
                                                instance, it cites the common formula, “suffering is
                                                to be understood, its origin is to be abandoned, its
                                                cessation is to be realized, the path is to be
                                                cultivated.” Similarly, in the context of the four
                                                applications of mindfulness, the Buddha tells
                                                Mañjuśrī that he will teach the meditation on the
                                                body as “ugly,” feeling and mind as “arising and
                                                ceasing,” and phenomena as devoid of “notions of
                                                them as wholes.” However, the sūtra uses these early
                                                Buddhist teachings only as a starting point on which

                                                subjects in a different way, but how it does so. The
                                                sūtra’s exposition is for the most part based on the

                                                offers on individual aids to enlightenment is highly

                                                The two translations generally follow the same

                                                differences. While the Chinese follows the common

                                                mindfulness. Moreover, in the Chinese translation
                                                the Buddha also teaches four kinds of effort and

                                                phenomena in such a way that there will be no notion
