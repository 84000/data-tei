                                        place in the Jeta Grove at Śrāvastī. Knowing that many
                                        bodhisattvas are wondering about proper Dharma conduct, the
                                        Buddha Śākyamuni gives a teaching on this topic to a great
                                        number of bodhisattvas. The teaching follows a format in
                                        which the Buddha first makes a short cryptic statement that
                                        seems to go against the conventions of proper behavior for
                                        bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas then inquire as to the
                                        meaning of this statement, and the Buddha proceeds to
                                        explain how to interpret the initial statement in order to
                                        decipher the underlying meaning. Because of his teaching,
                                        many gods and bodhisattvas are able to make great progress
                                        on the path. </p>

                                                  Conduct</title> takes place in the Jeta Grove at
                                                Śrāvastī, where the Buddha resides with a great
                                                gathering of bodhisattvas. Knowing that these
                                                bodhisattvas have questions regarding proper Dharma
                                                conduct, the Buddha decides to teach on this topic.
                                                The Buddha first makes a short cryptic statement
                                                that seems to go against the conventions of proper
                                                behavior for bodhisattvas. For example, at one point
                                                the Buddha says, “Noble sons, be terrified, be
                                                without joy, be without love, and be without
                                                compassion.” When the bodhisattvas inquire as to the
                                                meaning of this statement, the Buddha elaborates, “
                                                ‘Terrified’ means being terrified by the levels of
                                                the hearers and the solitary buddhas. ‘Without joy’
                                                means not finding any joy in the formless
                                                attainments. ‘Without love’ means relinquishing
                                                outer phenomena. ‘Without compassion’ means giving
                                                away personal body parts, such as the head. That is
                                                the proper conduct.” These statements are followed

                                                conventions of the Bodhisattva Vehicle. As a result

                                        <p tid="7">Very little is known about the literary history
                                                of this text. A Sanskrit version of this sūtra is no
                                                longer extant, and it appears that it was never
                                                translated into Chinese. Hence, the only witness of
                                                this sūtra available is the Tibetan translation
                                                included in the Kangyur. In the absence of any
                                                Sanskrit witness or Chinese translation, it is
                                                difficult to determine much about the history of
                                                this scripture in India and East Asia, apart from
                                                noting the fact that its absence in the Chinese
                                                canon may indicate a relatively narrow circulation
                                                in India. The colophon of the Tibetan translation
                                                states that it was produced by Prajñāvarman and
                                                Yeshé Dé, thus locating its translation in the late
                                                eighth or early ninth century. This dating is also
