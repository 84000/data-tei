                                        mendicant Dīrghanakha approaches and questions the Buddha about his doctrine concerning the incontrovertible
                                        relationship between karma and its effects in the world. He then poses a series of ten questions regarding the
                                        karmic causes of certain attributes of the Buddha, from his vajra body to the raised uṣṇīṣa on his crown. The
                                        Buddha responds to each question with the cause for each attribute, roughly summing up the eight poṣadha vows
                                        and the ways he observed them in the past. Dīrghanakha drops his staff and bows to the Buddha, pledging to
                                        take refuge in the Three Jewels and maintain the eight poṣadha vows.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Dīrghanakha the Wandering Mendicant</title> takes place on
                                                Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha. As the Buddha teaches the Dharma to the fourfold saṅgha, the
                                                brahmin and wandering mendicant Dīrghanakha approaches and interrogates the Buddha, in somewhat
                                                irreverent tones, about his teaching that actions dependably produce particular effects in the world.
                                                He then poses a series of ten questions regarding the karmic causes of certain attributes of the
                                                Buddha. These questions refer to the Buddha’s (1) vajra body, (2) long and webbed fingers, (3)
                                                complete faculties and fully developed body, (4) tongue that covers his face, (5) lion’s gait, (6)
                                                forty even and white teeth, (7) fragrance of moral discipline, (8) thirty-two signs, (9) three seats,
                                                and (10) raised uṣṇīṣa on his crown. The Buddha responds to each question by identifying the cause for
                                                each attribute, roughly summing up the eight poṣadha vows and the ways he observed them in the past.
                                                He also mentions his previous offerings and devotion to the Three Jewels and to his parents,
                                                preceptors, scholars, gurus, and other worthy ones. At this point, Dīrghanakha drops his staff and
                                                bows to the Buddha, pledging three times to take refuge in the Three Jewels and to maintain
                                                continuously and correctly the eight poṣadha vows in the manner of the arhats. </p>

                                        <p tid="8">The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">poṣadha</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gso sbyong</foreign>) refers to the ceremony performed every full and new moon day
                                                by monastics, in which they confess any faults or transgressions and recite the prātimokṣa vows.
                                                Although lay people are restricted from going to these ceremonies, they traditionally adopt what are
                                                called “the eight poṣadha vows,”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-074-003-5">

                                                lunar day of the poṣadha ceremony or on other occasions, usually for a single day at a time. They are
                                                to refrain from (1) killing, (2) stealing, (3) sexual misconduct, (4) lying or divisive speech, (5)
                                                intoxication, (6) eating at inappropriate times, (7) entertainment such as singing, dancing, seeing
                                                shows, and beautifying themselves with adornments or cosmetics, and (8) using a high bed. These amount
                                                to not only an expansion of the standard list of five lay vows (which constitute the first five), but
                                                most of the ten vows of a novice monk or nun (with the seventh split in two as in this sūtra), which
                                                include the additional vow to not handle money. In a sense, the laity become monastics for a day, and
                                                the occasion is understood to be a period of abstinence that often involves fasting as a way to purify
                                                one’s conduct, often in conjunction with the monastic community. </p>

                                                brahmanical resonance. It means to nourish (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">poṣa</foreign>) and

                                                practice of abstinence with regard to the eight poṣadha vows or fasting, while only the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">poṣadha</foreign> is used as the name for the ceremony itself.
                                                Thus, at the end of the sūtra, Dīrghanakha vows to uphold the eight poṣadha vows in the context of the

                                                vow to follow this for one day but pledges to make the special commitment of practicing them

                                                Dīrghanakha states that “no self endures [after death],” to which the Buddha replies by summarizing
                                                the various views of ascetics and brahmins as they relate to the endurance or nonendurance of a self.
                                                He again teaches the way of contemplating impermanence rooted in the observation of physical
                                                sensation. Dīrghanakha immediately grasps the Dharma and, unlike in the Pali sutta, takes ordination
                                                as a monk. Here his story concludes with these words of the Buddha: “Monks, among my monk disciples
                                                who have gained the knowledge of perfect discernment, the monk Koṣṭhila is supreme.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-074-003-19"> Miller (2018), <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on Going

                                                fact, the Buddha’s omniscience—directly or indirectly—can be seen as the principal focus of the
                                                questions put by all these individuals. Dīrganakha’s questions in the vinaya account seek to establish
                                                some sort of ultimate reality (although in the sūtra version translated here his questions are limited
                                                to the past causes of some of the Buddha’s unique physical marks). Śreṇika Vatsagotra’s questions
                                                directly address what have come to be called the twelve or fourteen “unanswerable points” (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">avyākṛta­vastu</foreign>). Ulka begins with the “unanswerable” question of
                                                where sentient beings originated from in the first place. In each case, the ways in which the Buddha
                                                responds bring about not only a complete resetting of the parameters of the questions, but also a
                                                fundamental change in how the questioners perceive him.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-074-003-159">The first chapter of Nāgārjuna’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­prajñā­pāramitā­śāstra</title>
