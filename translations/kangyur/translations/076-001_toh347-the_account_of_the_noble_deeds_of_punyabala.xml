                <p tid="2">In Śrāvastī, at Prince Jeta’s Grove, several elder monks in the Buddha’s assembly cannot agree on
                    which human quality is most valuable and beneficial: beauty, diligence, artistry, or insight. They
                    ask the Buddha, who replies that <term>merit</term>, which gives rise to all the qualities they have noted, is of
                    most benefit to beings. To illustrate this point, he tells the story of a past life in which he was
                    born as Puṇyabala, with four older brothers who were each named after their most
                    prized quality: Rūpabala, Vīryavanta, Śilpavanta, and
                    Prajñāvanta. In an ensuing contest to determine which quality produces the best outcomes in
                    real life, Puṇyabala wins, and through his <term>merit</term> is granted dominion over much of the world. The
                    Buddha then goes on to tell the story of his even earlier lifetime as Dyūtajaya,
                    during which he developed the intention to attain buddhahood through the accumulation of <term>merit</term>.</p>

                        most recognizable literary forms in Buddhism: the Buddha’s past-life stories. These stories are
                        usually morality tales, which highlight the positive benefits of certain actions and the
                        detrimental results of others. This tale focuses on the benefits of accruing <term>merit</term>. Puṇyabala is
                        a young prince whose store of <term>merit</term> is so great that he acquires untold riches and power.</p>

                    <p tid="11">Most past-life stories of the Buddha are found within two genres of Buddhist literature: <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadānas</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātakas</foreign>. The Sanskrit term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">avadāna</foreign>, broadly meaning “narrative” or “tale,” denotes a type of exemplary story
                        that is common to most Indian religious traditions. In the Buddhist context, avadāna is
                        traditionally specified as the tenth of a twelvefold categorization of Buddhist scripture (Skt.
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pravacana</foreign>), classified according to
                        content, thematic structure, and literary style. Although this class of works is as varied as it
                        is voluminous, the stories typically illustrate the results of good and bad karma, indicating
                        how past deeds have shaped present circumstances. In this vein, many avadānas, the present one
                        included, set out to show how the exemplary lives of the Buddha, or more often of his followers,
                        have resulted from their meritorious deeds in past lives. Avadānas may also, in certain cases,
                        include prophecies (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">vyākaraṇa</foreign>) of future
                        spiritual attainments. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-076-001-8"/>
                    <p tid="12">Avadānas recounting past deeds generally follow a three-part narrative structure: a story from
                        the present life of the Buddha or another protagonist, a story of an exemplary past deed, and a
                        connecting conclusion that shows how the past protagonist and his circle were prior incarnations
                        of the present protagonist and his circle. In this regard, avadānas bear a close relationship to
                            <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jātakas</foreign> (“birth stories” of the Buddha),
                        which some scholars have justifiably considered to be a subset of the avadāna genre. One notable
                        difference, however, is that the protagonist of an avadāna is often not the Buddha himself, as
                        it is in most jātaka stories, but one of his followers or prospective followers.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-001-9"> Jātakas typically relate stories from the Buddha’s
                                past lives, in which the Buddha is either the protagonist of the story or a witness to
                                other events. See Appleton 2010, pp. 3–6; and Rothenberg 1990, 4–5.</note> Another
                        difference is that avadānas typically concern realized beings’ past <distinct>human</distinct>
                        lives, not those as animals or nonhumans, as is the case in many jātaka tales. Finally, while
                        jātaka stories had wide popular appeal, with plots, characters, and motifs drawn from pan-Indian
                        folklore, the avadānas seem to have been originally intended primarily for monastics, as
                        suggested by their frequent references to attendant monks, their moral tone, and their specific
                        prescriptions for Buddhist practice that are interspersed throughout the narratives. Yet, in the
                        course of their historical diffusion, these edifying tales of spiritual and moral achievement
                        eventually gained wide popularity and came to inspire and educate Buddhist monastics and lay
                        followers alike.</p>

                        all rival character traits, being the only one that leads directly to spiritual attainment.

                        contains erotic intrigues or escapades that are absent in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Puṇya­balāvadāna</title> and the Tocharian tale, though the latter does describe at some length a nocturnal liaison between a painter and a maiden, as an illustration of the
                        perils of artistry offered by the wise Prajñāvanta. In general, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Puṇya­balāvadāna</title> gives comparatively little consideration to the feats of the other
                        princes, which are each summarized in only a line or two and devotes far more attention than the

                        Puṇyabala’s life. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāvastu</title> narrative, it is not through
                        any meritorious deeds that Puṇyavanta earns the respect of King Brahmadatta and his ministers,
                        but rather by generally making an agreeable impression on them, and especially by not falling prey to the sexual advances of the love-smitten princess! It is
                        for these rather passive successes that the king rewards Puṇyavanta with the princess’s hand in
                        marriage and makes him heir to the throne. In the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Puṇya­balāvadāna</title>, by contrast, it is only through a series of arduous merit-making
                        tasks—including living in poverty, giving wealth to the poor, giving his limbs and blood to an
                        amputee, and making the aspiration to gain spiritual awakening so that he can liberate all
                        beings from saṃsāra—that Puṇyabala’s efforts bear fruit. Even then, it is only upon gaining the
                        final approval of the god Śakra, who appears in the guise of a brahmin to interrogate the young
                        prince and ensure that his altruistic deeds have not been corrupted by any disinclination or
                        vested interest, that Puṇyabala finally gains prosperity, kingship, and the assurance of future
                        awakening to buddhahood. </p>

                        and the maintenance of discipline. The Buddha’s teaching prompts his students to debate over
                        which human quality should be considered the most valuable quality and therefore the most worthy
                        aim in life. Venerable Nanda argues that good looks are most valuable to humans.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-076-001-22"> The figure of Nanda in this text alludes to the

                        resolve their disagreement, they ask the Buddha. The Buddha tells them that <term>merit</term> is the best
                        human quality, as it underpins all the others. He then tells a story from one of his past lives
                        to illustrate this claim. </p>

                        brothers each exemplify, and indeed are named after, the human qualities they consider most
                        worthy: Rūpabala, Vīryavanta, Śilpavanta, and
                        Prajñāvanta. It becomes clear early on that it is Puṇyabala’s inborn quality of <term>merit</term>,
                        especially generosity, that makes his birth the most valuable and auspicious of the five.
                        Indeed, his presence in his mother’s womb already attracts the veneration of the gods and all
                        the kingdom’s residents, including the king, and causes treasures to rain down from the sky. </p>

                        generosity. A key example of this is his compassionate act of granting food to hungry pretas who were hitherto unable to eat anything that
                        was offered to them. </p>

                        he eventually devises a test to see which of their qualities is the most valuable quality for
                        humans. He suggests that they travel to a foreign land where they are unknown and test out which
                        quality proves most beneficial to themselves and others. The other brothers agree, and all five
                        leave home to live incognito in a distant land. After they arrive, the other brothers soon find
                        success by virtue of their respective qualities, but they are not as successful as Puṇyabala. In
                        fact, their varying degrees of success reflect an ascending hierarchy of the values they embody,
                        with each being more beneficial and encompassing than the last.</p>

                        medical advice to a rival king and was punished by amputation of all his limbs. Puṇyabala offers
                        him his own limbs, and he uses the power of words of truth to attach his severed limbs to their
                        new recipient. Śakra is compelled by this act to make an appearance. He demands to know if
                        Puṇyabala regrets the action, and Puṇyabala confirms his continuing diligence in generosity by
                        pronouncing another truth statement—which restores his arms and legs. Śakra is impressed and
                        states that Puṇyabala will soon attain awakening. </p>

                        His brothers and father seek him out and acknowledge his superiority. After his death, he is

                        story were none other than his current parents, and Puṇyabala’s brothers were the four monks who
                        argued over which human quality is the most valuable quality. </p>

                    <p tid="25">The Buddha continues with a further past-life story in which he had taken birth as a pauper named
                        Dyūtajaya, who had gambled away all his money and become utterly destitute.
                        On his way home, however, he encountered a previous buddha named Aparājita, to whom he confessed
                        his errant ways; he aroused the mind of awakening and made an offering to Aparājita of five handfuls of cowrie shells and his upper garment. This was a paltry offering, but presumably all he could
                        manage given his recent deprivation and, most importantly, it was made with pure intention. As a
                        result of this pure deed, he went on to first become wealthy, then a king on earth, and
                        eventually a king in heaven. Eventually, it was the catalyst for his rebirths as Puṇyabala and
                        the Buddha. This final narrative serves to illustrate how any human being, even a wrongdoer, can
                        attain the highest goals in life if he or she strives to benefit others with pure intention.</p>

                        because I have observed that those with artistry achieve results. Therefore, artistry alone is
                        the most valuable quality of humans. Moreover, even low-born artisans are certainly respected by
                        kings, ministers, brahmins, and householders.</p>
