                                <p tid="2">During an assembly in Śrāvastī, the Buddha requests the
                                        bodhisattva Mañjuśrī to give a teaching on the scope of a
                                        buddha, which refers to the perceptual range of the awakened
                                        state. Mañjuśrī obliges by stating that in the awakened
                                        state ordinary perception and cognition are transcended, so
                                        the scope of buddha is beyond conception. A discourse ensues
                                        in which the Buddha and Mañjuśrī converse about the
                                        “sameness of all phenomena,” and how the scope of a buddha,
                                        or the true nature of all phenomena, may be found in the
                                        afflictions themselves. The disciple Subhūti then engages
                                        Mañjuśrī on the subject of how a bodhisattva can both
                                        <term rend="ignore">cultivate</term> this awakening and still remain involved in the
                                        world. The god Śrībhadra then joins the discussion and
                                        invites Mañjuśrī to visit the Heaven of Joy. Instead of
                                        going, Mañjuśrī magically manifests the Heaven of Joy there
                                        and then. All are amazed and the Buddha praises his power to
                                        create miraculous manifestations.</p>

                                <p tid="3">In the second half of the sūtra, Māra, who is present in
                                        that assembly in disguise, asks for further proof of
                                        Mañjuśrī’s powers to create manifestations. Overawed by
                                        Mañjuśrī’s further miraculous displays, Māra reveals a
                                        formula that offers protection from the disturbances caused
                                        by his kind. Mañjuśrī then agrees to go to the Heaven of
                                        Joy. There, he teaches the gods about the bodhisattva path,
                                        and gives a full account of all thirty-seven factors that
                                        lead to awakening. When Śrībhadra asks Mañjuśrī about a
                                        distant world called Light of All Good Qualities,
                                        Mañjuśrī miraculously illuminates this distant buddhafield
                                        and its buddha, Samantabhadra, to the great delight of all
                                        the bodhisattvas in both worlds.</p>

                                                discourse between the Buddha, the bodhisattva
                                                Mañjuśrī, and the elder Subhūti on the subject of
                                                “the scope of a buddha” (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">buddhaviṣaya</foreign>, Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sangs rgyas kyi
                                                  yul</foreign>). As becomes clear, the scope of a
                                                buddha here refers to the perceptual range of the
                                                awakened state, which transcends the duality of
                                                ordinary perception, and is therefore beyond the
                                                capacity of the ordinary mind to conceive. When the
                                                Buddha asks Mañjuśrī where this scope of a buddha
                                                may be found, he replies, “In the afflictions of all
                                                sentient beings.” He continues, “The nature of the
                                                scope of a buddha is also the nature of all
                                                afflictions.” </p>

                                        <p tid="12">Mañjuśrī’s answer reflects a recurrent theme in
                                                Mahāyāna literature, namely the inseparability of
                                                saṃsāra—the suffering world that all who are not
                                                awakened inhabit—and nirvāṇa—the state that
                                                transcends this suffering world. In the ensuing
                                                discussion, Mañjuśrī invokes a series of paradoxical
                                                responses that culminate in the statement that
                                                neither is he besotted with nor free of the three
                                                poisons—attachment, hatred, and delusion—since he
                                                has realized the “sameness of all phenomena in the
                                                expanse of reality.” The śrāvaka disciple Subhūti, a
                                                figure often present during philosophical discourses
                                                of this nature, then joins the discussion, and
                                                Mañjuśrī explains to him how bodhisattvas manage to
                                                <term rend="ignore">cultivate</term> the ultimate view while still remaining

                                                a different type of inconceivability. In attendance
                                                is a god, Śrībhadra, who, delighted by Mañjuśrī’s
                                                teaching, invites him to come to his own home world,

                                                there. Without answering, Mañjuśrī decides to do
                                                Śrībhadra one better. Instead of traveling to the
                                                Heaven of Joy, he miraculously manifests the entire
                                                heaven—along with all its beautiful gardens, ornate
                                                architectural features, and vivacious attending
                                                goddesses—there and then. All who witness this are
                                                awestruck, and the Buddha extols Mañjuśrī’s ability
                                                to conjure “inconceivable miraculous
                                                manifestations.”</p>

                                                (lit. “Wicked Māra”), who is also present at that

                                                  featuring Mañjuśrī, but it is impossible to know

                                                then returns to the god Śrībhadra’s initial request
                                                and agrees to travel to the Heaven of Joy to teach
                                                its divine inhabitants. Mañjuśrī’s teaching in the

                                                which preceded it in the first half. Here Mañjuśrī
                                                offers a detailed survey of how to cultivate the
                                                bodhisattva path. Several sets of eight outline how
                                                to purify moral discipline, learning, meditative

                                                certainty, and heedfulness. Mañjuśrī also provides

                                                the six perfections in turn, and then gives a full

                                                awakening, from the four applications of mindfulness
                                                and the four correct exertions through to the seven

                                                instance of miraculous display. Śrībhadra asks
                                                Mañjuśrī about a distant world called Light of
                                                All Good Qualities. Mañjuśrī confirms he knows this
                                                world, which is an unfathomable distance above them,
                                                where another buddha, Samantabhadra, is teaching. He
                                                sends light rays from his body, which are seen by
                                                the inhabitants of that world. When Samantabhadra is
                                                asked where these light rays came from, he answers
                                                in mirror form: from an unfathomable distance below,
                                                in a world called Sahā where the Buddha Śākyamuni
                                                resides and teaches. Samantabhadra then sends light
                                                back to Mañjuśrī’s assembly in the Heaven of Joy,
                                                revealing the gods and bodhisattvas there to those

                                                  completely understands suffering. Whoever sees
                                                  that all phenomena are ultimately undestroyed
                                                  abandons the source of suffering. Whoever sees
                                                  that all phenomena are completely beyond suffering
                                                  realizes the cessation of suffering. Whoever sees
                                                  that all phenomena are completely empty cultivates
                                                  the path to liberation. This is because all
                                                  phenomena are without an intrinsic nature. Their
                                                  intrinsic nature is only the emptiness of the

                                                the method, wisdom, and gnosis of bodhisattvas,”
                                                replied Mañjuśrī. “Reverend Subhūti, the meaning of
                                                what a wise person has explained is understood
                                                through analogies. So I will give you an analogy,
                                                Reverend Subhūti, like this: A great master archer
                                                has a dear, beautiful, attractive, and handsome only
                                                son. But he also has an unpleasant and unattractive
                                                adversary. When from a great distance he sees his
                                                only son, who has taken a wrong turn on the road, he
                                                thinks it is his adversary. <ref cRef="F.271.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-043-016-433"/> So he
                                                shoots an arrow, intending to kill him. As soon as
                                                he does so, he realizes that it is his son. Using
                                                his previously developed ability to run incredibly
                                                fast, he catches the arrow with his hand just as it
                                                is about to strike the body of his only son. This is
                                                just an analogy for understanding the meaning. How
                                                does it relate to the meaning? Reverend Subhūti, the
                                                master archer represents a bodhisattva. Reverend
                                                Subhūti, the only son represents how a bodhisattva
                                                holds all beings dear, thinking of them as their
                                                only son. The adversary to be killed represents all
                                                afflictions. Reverend Subhūti, the arrow represents
                                                the power of the wisdom of the noble ones. Reverend
                                                Subhūti, it is like this: By running incredibly fast
                                                the master archer catches the arrow so that the
                                                arrow he has shot does not strike the body of his
                                                only son. In the same way, Reverend Subhūti, by
                                                developing the power of the perfection of wisdom, a
                                                bodhisattva discerns that each and every formation
                                                is unborn. But having looked at and determined
                                                reality itself, a bodhisattva also develops the
                                                power of great compassion and skillful means, and
                                                this makes the extent of reality manifest. In this
                                                way, one does not remain at the level of a śrāvaka
                                                or a pratyekabuddha, one stays at the level of a
                                                bodhisattva. And one also leads others to the level
                                                of a buddha.” </p>

                                                have no achievement. They have no realization. Why?
                                                Because so-called ‘achievement’ is fleeting, and

                                                through his wisdom. As for us, we think that those
                                                who say ‘I know suffering’ without knowing its
                                                defining characteristic should be considered those
                                                with excessive pride, and those who say ‘I cultivate
                                                the path’ without knowing the source of suffering,
                                                its cessation, and the path to achieve its cessation
                                                should be considered those with excessive pride.
                                                Why? Because whatever is the defining characteristic
                                                of suffering, of its source, of its cessation, <ref cRef="F.273.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-043-016-437"/> and of the path to
                                                its cessation is also the defining characteristic of
                                                the unborn. And the defining characteristic of the
                                                unborn is being without characteristic, and being
                                                without characteristic is the liberation of the
                                                noble ones. As such, all phenomena are the
                                                characteristic of liberation. So to call someone
                                                ‘one who understands suffering,’ ‘one who abandons
                                                its source,’ ‘one who actualizes its cessation,’ or
                                                ‘one who cultivates the path’ has no referent. Thus,
                                                those who become fearful upon hearing that all
                                                phenomena are the same should be understood as

                                                day hence, I vow not to go within a radius of a
                                                hundred yojanas of those who practice this Dharma
                                                discourse, nor will I try to disturb them whether
                                                they are in villages, towns, cities, provinces,
                                                countries, or palaces. I will be as respectful
                                                toward those who uphold, explain, teach, analyze,
                                                and practice this Dharma as I am toward the Teacher.
                                                Nevertheless, Bhagavān, there are some in my retinue
                                                who will try to obstruct the teachings of the

                                                them, sons and daughters of the lineage should

                                <p>The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">buddhaviṣaya</foreign> refers to the perceptual
                                                  range of the awakened state. A buddha is beyond
                                                  ordinary, dualistic perception and recognizes the
                                                  sameness of all phenomena as emptiness. Therefore
                                                  the perceptual range of buddha is boundless, and
                                                  defies any description, categorization, or
                                                  quantification. The term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">buddhaviṣaya</foreign> is often closely related
                                                  to the alternative term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">buddhagocara</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">sangs rgays kyi

                                                  refer to buddhafields. The term has been

                                                  are listed as either five or six. The first five
                                                  are clairvoyance (divine sight), divine hearing,
                                                  knowing how to manifest miracles, remembering
                                                  previous lives, and knowing what is in the minds
                                                  of others. A sixth, knowing that all defects have
                                                  been eliminated, is often added. The first five

                                                  by non-Buddhist yogis, while the sixth is
                                                  supramundane and attained only through the
