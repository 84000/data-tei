                    multistoried meditation halls with scented shrine rooms and rooftop verandas. This chapter also explains how all monks at a
                    monastery must gather fortnightly in the hall or in a place that has been specially demarcated for such purposes within the
                    monastery site’s larger boundary. There, they observe the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">poṣadha</foreign> or “restoration

                            to the material discussed here is not entirely clear. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that much of this
                            material applies equally to nuns; Tibetan commentators like Butön Rinchen Drup use the verb <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">kha spo ba</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">spo ba</foreign> to describe how material
                            for males can be “transferred” to females, for instance. The Indic commentator Dharmamitra even says that, apart from the
                            role of officiant, which must be filled by a monk in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, nuns may serve in all positions during

                        required that the newly admitted live and train under a monastic elder or “support” for at least five years. <title xml:lang="en">The

                        countryside, staying on the outskirts of villages and begging alms as they went. Different preferences for these diverging
                        lifestyles must have led to a dilemma for many monastic mentors and those they were mentoring. A narrative in <title xml:lang="en">The

                        countryside like other wandering mendicants. This prompts the Buddha to allow monks in training to seek a new support, whose

                        monks, praising the foot of a tree as best but also allowing monks to live in multistoried buildings, halls, large estate
                        buildings, and so on.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-002-103"> See <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on Going

                        Here, in <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on the Restoration Rite</title>, we are given the backstory of how itinerant
                        Buddhist mendicants encouraged to live at the foot of trees came to live in increasingly elaborate settlements supported by
                        permanent endowments. According to <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on the Restoration Rite</title>, the monks’ need for a
                        place to practice meditation undisturbed is what drives the growth of Buddhist monastic settlements. Monks try but fail to
                        practice meditation in several places before the Buddha consents to the construction of small meditation residences. Small
                        clusters of huts give way to larger clusters until the Buddha allows a community meditation hall to be built with monastic
                        dwellings in a three-sided ring around the hall. Eventually, when the monks do not fit even into single-story halls, the
                        Buddha consents to the building of a second story, and so on. And, since such facilities require management, the Buddha also
                        consents to the appointment of five kinds of caretakers, who serve as a monastery administrative committee, each with
                        individual responsibility over the site, the residences and hall, the work roster, the monastery resources and supplies, and
                        the attendants on site, respectively.</p>

                        resident and visiting monks. These designations speak to a mobile Buddhist saṅgha and suggest that the freedom of movement
                        promised after five years to qualified monks was eagerly embraced. Such movement is well documented in both medieval China and
                        Tibet, where monks traveled for business, pilgrimage, study, and more. <title xml:lang="en">The Chapter on the Restoration

                        monks’ ability to meditate as the pretext for the increasingly complex monastic settlements.</p>

                            need for a quorum reflects an important function of the restoration rite, which is to affirm the purity of the saṅgha on a
                            regular basis. Here, for a monk or nun to be “pure” means either (1) that they have not incurred any offenses or (2) that
                            they have confessed and made amends for them. Many scholars have observed that the saṅgha’s reputation for upstanding
                            moral conduct was inextricably tied to patronage, that the saṅgha’s purity was the form of currency famously described by
                            the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu as “symbolic” and “cultural capital.”<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-002-136"> See, e.g., Prebish 2003, p. 57. Prebish, citing Charles Wei-hsun Fu, explains how this social-embeddedness informs
                                but does not comprise the whole of the saṅgha’s moral philosophy: “[T]he Vinaya was as much concerned with the
                                    <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">pariśuddhi</foreign> or complete purity of the community, individually and
                                organizationally, as it was with the specifics of ethical conduct. Under no circumstances should we presume that
                                ethical concerns were superseded in the Vinaya; rather, they were included in a series of tiered concerns that focused
                                on institutional, but not exclusively ethical conduct.”</note> That the saṅgha communally affirms its members’
                            monastic purity every fortnight assures the laity that the saṅgha is the proper recipient of alms—that giving to the
                            saṅgha will yield desirable karmic fruits—which helps to ensure continued lay support. This was a pressing social concern
                            for Buddhist monastics, as can be discerned in the narrative that begins this chapter, which portrays a group of laypeople
                            admiring the upavasatha observances of non-Buddhist ascetic communities. </p>

                        <p tid="37">After the Buddha convinces Kapphiṇa to attend the restoration, the two of them go together to where the other
                            monks have gathered. There, the Buddha teaches the assembled monks how to demarcate the boundaries of a monastic “site” or
                            precinct. Once the matter of sites and boundaries has been thoroughly clarified through a series of prescriptions and
                            supplementary prescriptions, prohibitions, and consents,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-002-138"> These categories

                            individually recite each offense in a class. Once the reciter has begun to recite the individual offenses that comprise a
                            class, he must continue reciting to the end of that class or the recitation will be considered improper.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-001-002-140"> See Dharmamitra, Toh 4120, vol. yu, <ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4120.html">F.109.b</ref>: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">brtsams pa’i sde tshan ni rdzogs par bya dgos so zhes bya ba ni/ ་pham par ’gyur ba dang dge ’dun lhag ma dang

                                    interpretations. Charles Prebish surveys a variety of etymological explanations of the term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātimokṣa</foreign> in his 1974 study and translation of <title xml:lang="en">The Prātimokṣa Sūtras</title> of the Mahāsāṃghikas and the Mūlasarvāstivādins. Prebish credits Sukumar Dutt
                                    with suggesting that the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātimokṣa</foreign> “lends itself to
                                    interpretation as something serving as a bond, the prefix <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Prati</foreign>
                                    meaning ‘against’ and the root <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">Mokṣa</foreign> meaning ‘scattering’ ”
                                    (Prebish 2002, p. 18). Prebish critically examines the socio-historical evidence for Dutt’s suggestion on pp.
                                    17–24. He concludes that <title xml:lang="en">The Prātimokṣa Sūtra</title> may have served in some senses as
                                    a bond but finds Dutt’s etymological argument dubious. Note though that the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">saṃvara</foreign> reads more readily than <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="quote">prātimokṣa</foreign> as “bond” or “rule.” Tshonawa, p. 25: <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">bzhi pa

                                    <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prati</foreign> is apparently used in its sense of “in opposition to,

                                Importantly, however, Ācārya Śūra does not suggest that the Buddhist vow holder cares only for their own “individual

                                    offenses that may temporarily be “undetermined” (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">ma nges pa</foreign>;

                                    remnants or transgressions. Furthermore, Mūlasarvāstivādin monastics may also incur a “breach” (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">’gal tshabs</foreign>; Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">atisāra</foreign>), which is a transgression, according to Kalyāṇamitra (<ref rend="pending" target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh4113.html">F.241.b</ref>): <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="quote">’gal tshabs can zhes bya ba ni

                            illness, which is dealt with in the previous section—that may legitimately prevent a monastic or even a whole community
                            from performing the restoration rite. As above, the Buddha explains how consent should be sought from those monastics who
                            are absent, whether because they are being detained by a king or have some business elsewhere. The Buddha then explains
                            how a standing exemption from participating in the restoration rite may be given to monastics who are mentally unfit. This
                            section concludes with instructions for handling confessions on the day of the restoration rite and what to do if an
                            entire saṅgha has incurred the same offense and therefore cannot expiate it. </p>

                                P. <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">peyāla</foreign>). According to Hu-von Hinüber, Sanskrit and Pāli texts
                                generally elide such repetitions, reflecting the oral tradition of old India and Ceylon, whereas Tibetan translators
                                generally chose not to abridge the material (personal communication, June 19, 2016). For a discussion of formulaic
                                repetitions, see Hu-von Hinüber 1994, p. 157. For deviations between the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Poṣadhavastu</title> associated with these, see Hu-von Hinüber 1994, pp. 239–47.</note> The text
                            discusses several scenarios in which monks perform the restoration rite—knowingly or unknowingly—before all the monks have
                            gathered. Through the many repetitions, a simple principle becomes clear: if the restoration rite is started with the
                            intention of excluding others who have not yet arrived, the result is a violation, and those who so start it will be
                            guilty of a breach. The Tibetan text enumerates each of these scenarios individually, leading to extensive repetition.

                                The Sanskrit for this index translates as: “Tīrthikas offer poṣadha. / Why does he not observe poṣadha? / They don’t
                                sit if there is division on a site. / May you describe a poṣadha.” In her study of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Poṣadhavastu</title>, Hu-von Hinüber analyzes the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya’s system of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uddāna</foreign> and the ways in which it differs from those of other Vinaya schools. See Hu-von
                                Hinüber 1994, pp. 155–67 and Hu-von Hinüber 2016, p. 101, n. 177. This discrepancy appears to reflect a general
                                pattern for the present text, in which the Sanskrit <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">uddāna</foreign> read as
                                prose summaries while the Tibetan translations of these indices are lists that do not form complete sentences. Though
                                its relevance to the present textual discrepancy is uncertain, the Tibetan tradition preserves at least two ways of
                                organizing the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya: a canonical tradition of the Kangyur and a commentarial tradition that follows
                                Guṇaprabha’s <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vinaya­sūtravṛtti</title>, in which the canonical tradition’s material is

                                Sanskrit for “jar” is, apparently, <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ghaṭikā</foreign> (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gdos bu</foreign>). The Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ghaṭikā</foreign>, however, has two meanings, the more common being “water-jar, bucket,” (Apte 1957, vol. 2 p.
                                683). Specialized water jars were used to mark the passage of time (i.e. a “water clock,” as in Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">chu tshod</foreign>). The less common meaning of <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ghaṭikā</foreign> is “small stick,” (Edgerton, p. 219, col. 2). This is the meaning that Kalyāṇamitra
                                gives in glossing Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gdos bu</foreign>; Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">ghaṭikā</foreign> as “ ‘stick,’ [an item] made from wood or some other substance used to wake

                                jug” or “water jar” and (2) a “small stick.” We have added the numbers for clarity: “(1) Having filled it with water,
                                tied it to the neck with string, and hung it from the ear, [the small sphere] will shake violently when [the

                                is valid to proceed even if some monks have not yet arrived. Following Kalyāṇamitra, the reader must assume that the
                                monks in question are intentionally using this as a pretense to exclude other monks from the restoration rite. A
                                similar list of four motivations is found the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Uposathakkhandaka</title>, the Pāli parallel to
                                the present text, which gives <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn " type="term">vaggāvaggasaññī</foreign>,

                                as complete”; “doubtful”; “anxious by nature” or “having a bad character”; and “intent on or preparing for division.”
                                Note also that the last items in both the Pāli and Sanskrit lists do not exactly correspond. The Pāli gives 
                            <foreign xml:lang="Pi-Ltn" type="term">bhedapurekkhāra</foreign> (Skt.<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">

                                <p>A saṅgha at ease is a properly functioning monastic community, where official acts of the
                                    saṅgha, but especially the restoration rite, are observed. Kalyāṇamitra twice glosses the phrase “be at ease.” In
                                    the first example, he explains that monks are at ease in the knowledge that so long as they are on site, they will
                                    never be considered “separated from” their mantle, which would otherwise entail a fault. In a subsequent gloss, he
                                    writes that “to be at ease” means “to obtain purity” and hence “the joy felt due to the remission of one’s
                                    offenses.” This describes the state of a monastic who has made amends for their offenses.
