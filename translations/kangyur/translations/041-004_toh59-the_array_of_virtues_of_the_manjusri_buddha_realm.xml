                        <title xml:lang="en">The Array of Virtues of Mañjuśrī’s Buddha Realm</title> is a sūtra
                    that belongs to the Heap of Jewels (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnakūṭa</foreign>; Tib.
                        <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dkon brtsegs</foreign>) section of the Kangyur. The sūtra begins in
                    the city of Rājagṛha. This city was formerly the capital city of the kingdom of Magadha, which was
                    located in the present-day Indian state of Bihar. There, we are told, the Buddha Śākyamuni is
                    residing, surrounded by an enormous assembly of monks, bodhisattvas, and various divine beings.
                    During the course of the sūtra, the Buddha teaches in response to the queries of a variety of Dharma
                    seekers, including King Ajātaśatru, the ruler of Magadha. Later in the sūtra, the Buddha returns to
                    Vulture Peak Mountain and teaches based on questions posed by several of his senior disciples, such
                    as Śāriputra and Maitreya. Before beginning, the Buddha also inspires bodhisattvas living in various
                    other buddha realms to come to this world to hear his teachings. Once these bodhisattvas have
                    gathered, the bodhisattva Maitreya poses a series of questions pertaining to bodhisattva practice,
                    the development of buddha realms, and the attainment of awakening. In response, the Buddha Śākyamuni
                    identifies many qualities that bodhisattvas must develop to ensure the successful manifestation of
                    their future buddha realms, as well as the benefits of those qualities for the bodhisattvas
                    themselves. In the process, the Buddha explains how the extent of the qualities in a buddha realm is
                    determined by the scope of a bodhisattva’s mind set on awakening and by aspirations. Many
                    bodhisattvas are inspired by this and pledge to develop buddha realms abundant with such
                    qualities.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-041-004-4"/>
                <p tid="7">The second half of the sūtra centers around Mañjuśrī’s career as a bodhisattva and his
                    future buddha realm. Here the Buddha describes Mañjuśrī’s past lives and reveals details about his
                    future attainment of awakening as the Buddha Samantadarśin and the features of his buddha realm.
                    Throughout these teachings on Mañjuśrī’s spiritual qualities and awakened activity, Mañjuśrī himself
                    emphatically denies the existence of such achievements by reference to the nonexistence of all
                    phenomena, including his spiritual journey, and even his own nonexistence. The depictions of
                    his bodhisattva career and the resulting buddha realm in a distant future are thus placed explicitly
                    within the Great Vehicle teachings on emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. These teachings
                    inspire the bodhisattva assembly to manifest similar buddha realms. The Buddha then reveals that
                    there are four bodhisattvas, currently living in other realms, who can rival Mañjuśrī’s bodhisattva
                    conduct. These four bodhisattvas arrive at Vulture Peak Mountain, after which their visit evolves
                    into a shared explication among many bodhisattvas on what is known as <distinct>the Dharma teaching
                        on the single principle</distinct>. This is a theme that also appears in other Great Vehicle
                    sūtras as a synonym for sameness or suchness. Finally, as is customary in sūtra literature, the
                    events conclude with many beings achieving significant spiritual attainments.</p>

                    collection. The translators are listed as the Indian scholars Śīlendrabodhi and Jinamitra along with

                    Therefore, the Tibetan translation that we have rendered into English here would have been completed
                    during the early translation period, which is also attested by the text’s inclusion in the early

                    appears to have enjoyed a certain popularity among philosophical commentators, as its verses are

                    spiritual accomplishment. This English translation from the Tibetan has been produced based on the

                        Maitreya, Mañjuśrī, Apāyajaha, Avalokiteśvara, and Mahā­sthāmaprāpta, all of whom were
                        progressing irreversibly toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Also present were 720
                        million gods, all of whom had entered the Bodhisattva Vehicle. These gods included Śakra, lord
                        of the gods; Brahmā, lord of the world Enduring; and 42,000 Brahmā gods who had also entered the
                        Bodhisattva Vehicle. The assembly also included the four lords of the asuras: Vemacitrin, Balin,
                        Kharaskandha, and Prahlāda, each of whom was accompanied by hundreds of thousands of servants.
                        They were joined by 62,000 nāga kings, including Nanda, Upananda, Varuṇa, Sāgara, Manasvin,
                        Aparājita, Bhūbhṛt, Anavatapta, Giri, Mārtaṇḍa, and Candrottarya. <ref cRef="F.249.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-004-478"/> Also present were the Four Great Kings,
                        Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, and Vaiśravaṇa, each of whom was accompanied by hundreds of
                        thousands of servants. The assembly also included the yakṣa kings Kumbhīra, Āṭavaka, Sūciroma,
                        Sumana, Sumati, Surūpa, <term>Colorful</term>, Akṣobhya, and hundreds of thousands of other

                    <p tid="15">At that time the Blessed One had been staying in the city of Rājagṛha, where he was
                        venerated and attended to by gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras,
                        mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, and the fourfold assembly, who all served, honored, and worshiped
                        him. He received a rich supply of food, drinks, savories, garments, delicacies, bedding, and
                        medicines. One morning, the Blessed One donned his upper and lower robes and picked up his
                        offering bowl. Together with his great saṅgha of monks, and surrounded and preceded by trillions
                        of gods, he caused a shower of blue, red, and white lotuses to rain down. This occurred due to
                        the great strength, playful ability, magical capacity, and miraculous power of the Buddha. Then,
                        accompanied by the music of hundreds of thousands of instruments, he went to the palace of King
                        Ajātaśatru in the city of Rājagṛha to collect alms. As he set out, trillions of light rays shone
                        forth. At that point, the Blessed One performed a miracle in that wherever he placed his feet, a
                        lotus the size of a cart wheel sprang up, with golden petals, a silver stem, beryl anthers, and a
                        central cluster of fine gems. <ref cRef="F.249.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-004-479"/> In

                        virtues of their buddha realms, just as they desire. What is this one quality? Noble son, it is

                        motivation that is to be mastered? Noble son, pure motivation is arousing the mind set on
                        awakening and avoiding all nonvirtues. What is to be avoided? It is attachment, aggression,
                        ignorance, and craving for the features of the household life. Renouncing these things,
                        bodhisattvas have no desire for gain, honor, or praise, and they abide in the accomplishment of
                        going forth. What is the accomplishment of going forth? It is realizing all phenomena just as

                        that one does not see them as being real. When there is no seeing, no knowing, no assuming, no

                        called <distinct>understanding the aggregates</distinct>. Understanding the aggregates is
                        understanding all phenomena. Noble son, this is <distinct>the accomplishment of going

                        aggression, and hypocrisy arise with the presence of self-clinging and possessiveness. When in a
                        state of self-clinging and possessiveness, one recognizes neither positive qualities nor flaws.
                        This is termed <distinct>unknowing</distinct>. However, with respect to a person who fully
                        understands self-clinging and possessiveness just as they are, one cannot speak of knowing or
                        unknowing. Your Majesty, you should therefore train to avoid labeling any formations as either
                        going or coming from anywhere. Your Majesty, for one who neither goes anywhere nor comes from
                        anywhere, all phenomena are devoid of coming and going. For one in whom there is no coming or
                        going, there is no birth or cessation. For one in whom there is no birth or cessation, there is
                        no knowing. Just as it is with knowing, so it is with unknowing. Why is this? Because there is
                        no knowledge of any phenomenon that is either emancipated or not emancipated. When there is no
                        knowledge of any phenomenon that is either emancipated or not emancipated, one is said to have

                        opportunities to listen to the Dharma, they will ask how to attain these virtues. Once they have
                        heard these teachings, they will then practice them earnestly. (2) Śāriputra, additionally,
                        bodhisattvas will aspire to be born in pure buddha realms and will observe pure discipline.
                        Through such pure discipline, they will be born wherever they aspire. Once born there, they will
                        care about and reflect on those pure buddha realms. Thus, they will apprehend the
                        characteristics of the hearers’ perfection, the bodhisattvas’ perfection, and the perfection of
                        wealth and resources. Apprehending these characteristics, they will go before a thus-gone one

                        practice in order to acquire a vast array of the virtues of a buddha realm?’ That blessed one

                        earnestly. (3) Śāriputra, additionally, bodhisattvas must possess wisdom and engage in proper
                        deeds. They will purify ignorance and discard improper deeds. What are wisdom and proper deeds
                        in this context? <distinct>Wisdom</distinct> is apprehending what should be apprehended. Such
                        wisdom is free from the wisdom of the hearers and solitary buddhas. <distinct>Proper
                            deeds</distinct> are earnestly practicing the teachings one has heard. <ref cRef="F.268.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-041-004-517"/> (4) Additionally, Śāriputra, bodhisattvas must
                        be skilled in cause and origination. What are cause and origination in this context?
                            <distinct>Cause</distinct> refers to incorrect mental engagement; this is what causes beings
                        to observe the four errors. Rather than that, bodhisattvas should put effort into what is
                        correct. What is meant by correct engagement? It is to avoid mentally engaging in any
                        phenomenon. This also applies to origination. (5) Śāriputra, additionally, bodhisattvas must
                        know the essential nature of the Buddha and the essential nature of the realm. What is the
                        essential nature of the Buddha, and what is the essential nature of the realm? The

                        disengagement, so the less one observes phenomena, the more knowledge there is. Śāriputra, if
                        bodhisattvas have these five qualities, their aspirations will not degenerate, and they will
                        acquire and refine the arrays of virtues of the buddha realms just as they wish.</p>

                        Considering this, they will give away all their possessions. If they are not saddened even by

                        conduct and give away all possessions. Therefore, as they attain awakening thereby, they are

                        even at the cost of their lives. They will share their correctly upheld vows of discipline with
                        all beings, dedicating them to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. They will be pleased,
                        extremely pleased, by the thought, ‘I have discipline.’ With such joy, they will engage in pure
                        conduct, which brings them happiness both day and night. They will actualize the Dharma happily.
                        Endowed with proper Dharma conduct, their thoughts will also be proper. With proper thoughts,
                        they will develop patient acceptance of the profound. Having developed patient acceptance of the
                        profound, their views will be straight. With straight views, they will act assiduously in a
                        proper manner. Engaging in correct assiduousness, they will not find joy in the three realms of
                        existence. Not finding joy in the three realms, they will be afraid. Being afraid, they will
                        look for the source of this fear. Seeing the source, they will think, ‘All beings suffer just as
                        I do. Therefore, I will bear these beings’ burdens, for there is no other cause of their
                        well-being other than pacification.’ Contemplating this, bodhisattvas will gain great
                        compassion. With this great compassion, they will never give up their diligence until attaining
                        omniscience, acting as if their head or clothes were aflame</p>

                        for millions of eons, I will not give rise to malice, hostility, or aggression. Why not? Because

                        to diligence with the thought, ‘I am willing to remain in cyclic existence for millions of eons

                        grains of sand in the Ganges throughout the ten directions with the seven precious substances.
                        Arousing an attitude of generosity, and based on that outlook, they then engage in giving all

                        way, bodhisattvas delight in solitude and seclusion, living alone like the rhinoceros. Living in
                        solitude and seclusion, they will suffuse all beings in unison with love. In that way, they

                        Such bodhisattvas will attain awakening far more swiftly. Śāriputra, there are ten benefits

                        basis of the vows of discipline. All virtuous phenomena increase in the presence of insight.’
                        Considering this, they train in insight, meaning they train in the subjects of worldly crafts,
                        arts, incantations, medicine, and all the other subjects that are laborious and difficult to
                        master. However, as they train in these topics of learning, they develop the following
                        understanding: ‘Worldly insight does not lead to renunciation, detachment, cessation, peace,
                        superknowledge, complete awakening, mendicancy, or passing beyond sorrow. So what type of
                        insight might bring me peace? Whatever it may be, I must search for that type of craft,
                        incantation, medicine, or insight.’ In this way, they search for the origin of things. However,
                        when one is searching for the origin of things, one will fail to find any phenomenon on which
                        other phenomena rest. This failure to find anything will lead one to rest in complete peace. By

                        consider the welfare of beings, due to acknowledging that, in order to pacify the suffering of
                        all beings, one must intentionally embrace existence. Śāriputra, bodhisattvas who have these six
