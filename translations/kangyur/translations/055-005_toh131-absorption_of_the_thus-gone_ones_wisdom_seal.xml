                    expounds on this profound state, exhorting them to accomplish it themselves. The
                    sūtra also describes the qualities of bodhisattvas and their stages of

                        that the sūtra presents in a detailed list, with no explicit mention of states of deep

                    <p tid="297">It is in that respect that the current sūtra resembles some of these other works,
                        describing as it does a particular meditative absorption that the rest of the
                        title qualifies as “the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal.” Here,
                        <distinct>thus-gone one</distinct> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tathāgatha</foreign>) 
                        is a common epithet of a fully
                        awakened being. We have translated this term from the Tibetan 
                        <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">de bzhin gshegs pa</foreign>, 
                        “one who has thus gone,” whereas the Chinese equivalent, 
                        <foreign xml:lang="Zh-Ltn" type="term">ru lai</foreign>, reads closer 
                        to “thus-come one.” The final term, <distinct>wisdom seal</distinct> (Skt. 
                        <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">jñānamudrā</foreign>), qualifies the absorption in which the
                        thus-gone one dwells. <distinct>Seal</distinct> (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">mudrā</foreign>) has a rich and varied
                        usage in Buddhist literature. Generally, it refers to a stamp or brand, like
                        a royal seal that is used to mark property. Since the thus-gone one’s
                        absorption is infinite and unimpeded, all of reality falls into its domain.
                        Thus, all of reality is subsumed in, or sealed by, the wisdom actualized in
                        this absorption.</p>

                    <p tid="10">Like many Great Vehicle sūtras, <title xml:lang="en">The Absorption
                            of the Thus-Gone One’s Wisdom Seal</title> situates ancient India and
                        Buddha Śākyamuni in a much larger, cosmic context. The opening scene takes
                        place in the famous Veṇuvana (Bamboo Grove) monastic compound, near Rājagṛha,
                        the capital of the former kingdom of Magadha (present-day Bihar). Here the Buddha is dwelling
                        with a vast retinue of monks and bodhisattvas when he enters into an exalted
                        state of absorption called <distinct>the thus-gone one’s wisdom
                            seal</distinct>, indescribable except in ways that suggest its sheer
                        ineffability: it is “formless, indefinable, ungraspable, unimpeded, and not
                        apparent.”</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-12"/>
                    <p tid="11">The power of this state of absorption affects the entire
                        trichiliocosm, inspiring buddhas and bodhisattvas dwelling in faraway realms
                        to intensify their spiritual activity. Cosmic buddhas exhort their
                        innumerable bodhisattva disciples to seize the opportunity to go to the Veṇuvana
                        and learn about this absorption, which will be the culmination of their
                        training. Accordingly, the bodhisattvas magically travel there, eager to
                        receive teachings about this exalted state. Countless gods and nonhuman
                        beings, hearers, and monks join them in their quest. When they arrive,
                        however, the Buddha is nowhere to be seen, as their perceptions are not
                        attuned to the state in which he is absorbed. In dismay, the
                        assembly, led by a group of close disciples including Mahā­maudgalyāyana and
                        Subhūti, turns to the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī for advice on how to
                        communicate with the Buddha. He simply tells them to look inward: they will
                        find the Buddha within their own absorptions.</p>

                    <p tid="12">Thus, a line of communication is established with the Buddha, who
                        now begins to teach them about this absorption, which is the hallmark of all
                        thus-gone ones. The teaching follows an extensive apophatic methodology, in
                        which the Buddha negates any proposition that may be made about this most
                        profound state of absorption: “This absorption is formless, indefinable,
                        ungraspable, unimpeded, and not apparent. It is beyond knowledge and not an
                        object of knowledge.” Upon concluding his teaching about
                            the <distinct>absorption of the thus-gone one’s
                            wisdom seal</distinct>, all those in attendance purify negative karma
                        accumulated over innumerable eons and ensure that their progress to unsurpassed and
                        perfect awakening is irreversible.</p>

                    <p tid="13">The discourse then shifts, and the Buddha addresses Maitreya,
                        explaining seven ways in which bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening. He
                        also lists two sets of five qualities that characterize a nonregressing
                        bodhisattva, as well as five that mark an incorrigible, flawed individual on
                        the bodhisattva path. To illustrate the exemplary bodhisattva, the Buddha
                        recounts a past-life memory of the deeds of a great king named Puṇyodgata,
                        who was a devotee of the buddha Śaśiketu.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-15"/>
                    <p tid="14">Following this discourse, countless female devotees, led by the
                        queens of King Bimbisāra, promise their service to the Dharma in all
                        subsequent lives. This delights the Buddha, who beams a smile at them. The
                        women, captivated, eloquently enjoin the Buddha to give them a teaching
                        about the causes, qualities, and implications of his smile. In response, the
                        Buddha recounts more past-life memories, this time about the noble deeds of
                        an ancient ruler named Puṇyaraśmi, who was an exemplary guardian of the
                        Dharma. The Buddha also describes the degenerate age, in which the influence
                        of the Dharma will wane. During this time, he explains, it will be
                        especially important for those who follow him to train in the sūtra of 
                        <title xml:lang="en">The Absorption of the Thus-Gone One’s Wisdom Seal</title>,
                        and to master the absorption it describes. The Buddha then highlights
                        differences between bodhisattvas based on whether they have aroused the mind
                        of awakening and the roots of virtue in the presence of hundreds, of thousands,
                        or of millions of buddhas. In short, the latter have the greatest resolve to
                        traverse the path and are least susceptible to any kind of regression.
                        However, they will still suffer. The sūtra explains that whatever negative
                        karma remains for these bodhisattvas will be purified through instances of
                        ordinary human misfortune: they will be criticized, they will suffer bouts
                        of depression, they will be born into dysfunctional families, they will face
                        adverse economic conditions, and so forth. Bodhisattvas of the highest order
                        will bear these pains and persevere on the path; others will falter.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-055-005-16"/>
                    <p tid="15">Toward the end of the sūtra, the Buddha addresses Mañjuśrī,
                        Maitreya, and an assembly of distinguished disciples who ask him to explain
                        the meaning of the term <distinct>Dharma</distinct> itself. Thus begins a
                        long synonymic chain of significant Buddhist terms: inexhaustible, unborn,
                        uninterrupted, uncollected, ungraspable, nonabiding, and groundless, until
                        the final term <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">nirvāṇa</foreign>.
                        This list echoes the terms used earlier in the sūtra to describe
                            the <distinct>absorption of the thus-gone one’s
                            wisdom seal</distinct>. Given this definition of the Dharma, the
                        disciples wonder how they should act as its protectors. The Buddha explains
                        that if they indeed realize the meaning of what he has taught them,
                        “ultimately we find nothing at all—no Dharma and no conflict with the
                        Dharma.” Then, in a set of philosophically rich verses, he instructs them further in
                        the ultimate truth, beyond concepts and characteristics. The sūtra concludes
                        with another exhortation to the gathered assembly to accomplish
                        the <distinct>absorption of the thus-gone one’s
                            wisdom seal</distinct>.</p>

                        arouse the mind of awakening inspired by the blessed buddhas. Bodhisattvas 
                        arouse the mind of awakening in order to protect the holy Dharma when that holy
                        Dharma is disappearing. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening when they feel 
                        great compassion on seeing the realms of beings afflicted by so many
                        pains. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening inspired by other bodhisattvas.
                        Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening themselves when they have respectfully given 
                        beautiful gifts to bodhisattvas who have aroused the mind of awakening. Bodhisattvas 
                        arouse the mind of awakening when they see others arouse the mind of awakening.
                        Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening on hearing perfect praises sung about 
                        the qualities of the various ornaments of the thus-gone ones’ body, such as the excellent marks and
                        signs. Maitreya, these are the seven ways in which bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening.</p>

                        Dharma at a time when it is disappearing, and those bodhisattvas who arouse the
                        mind of awakening due to feelings of great compassion caused by witnessing

                                or codes possessed by advanced bodhisattvas that contain a
                                quintessence of their attainments, as well as the Dharma teachings
                                that express them and guide beings toward their realization. 
                                They are therefore often described in terms of “gateways” for entering
                                the Dharma and training in its realization, or “seals” that contain
                                condensations of truths and their expression. The term can also
                                refer to a statement, or incantation meant to protect or bring about
                                a particular result.</term>
