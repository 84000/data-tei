                <p tid="7">As the Buddha’s disciple Subhūti goes to collect alms one morning, he encounters
                    a laywoman who imparts to him wise and penetrating teachings on the nature of
                    reality. The bulk of the sūtra recounts Subhūti’s encounter and dialogue with
                    this laywoman, who turns out to be a highly developed spiritual being named
                    Strīvivarta. Subhūti himself adheres to the Hearers’ Vehicle, a spiritual path
                    based on the teachings that emphasize the discipline of the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">prātimokṣa</foreign> vows and the lack of any
                    fixed, singular entity that could constitute a personal “self.” By contrast,
                    Strīvivarta is a follower of the Bodhisattva Vehicle, a path toward the
                    development of boundless compassion, the ability to benefit beings on a vast
                    scale, and wisdom that realizes not only the lack of a personal self, but also
                    the lack of a fixed, graspable identity in all phenomena. Thus, their exchange
                    serves to contrast these two approaches to awakening. It is worth noting that
                    the name Strīvivarta means “female transformation,” a fact that seems relevant
                    as she in fact transforms into a male at the end of the sūtra.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-061-010-5"/>
                <p tid="8">Set in Rājagṛha, where the Buddha is staying with a large number of disciples,
                    the sūtra commences with Subhūti asking the Buddha about his dream the night
                    before. The Buddha explains that Subhūti’s dream indicates that a previously
                    unheard Dharma teaching will be heard; and with that, Subhūti sets off for town
                    to collect alms. Eventually he arrives at the home of Strīvivarta, who
                    immediately poses challenging questions to the monk on a series of profound
                    subjects. In exchange after exchange, Subhūti does his best to reply to the
                    laywoman, but she continuously confronts him with ever more provocative
                    questions.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-061-010-6"/>
                <p tid="9">As their dialogue unfolds, we encounter explanations regarding an array of
                    challenging topics. In addition to Strīvivarta’s eloquent ability to outshine
                    Subhūti on topics of profound import, she is also able to read Subhūti’s mind.
                    This fact significantly increases the monk’s consternation—not only does she
                    challenge him regarding what he says, she even directly confronts him about his
                    thoughts! Moreover, others (including disembodied voices from the sky and
                    various gods) appear throughout the sūtra to put Venerable Subhūti to the test.
                    When Subhūti tries to excuse himself and make an exit, he is schooled as to why
                    it is inappropriate to take one’s leave in such a situation.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-061-010-7"/>
                <p tid="10">Over the course of their encounter, Strīvivarta delivers a series of formidable
                    teachings that illuminate the nature of the Great Vehicle and the Buddha’s
                    purposes in going for alms. Strīvivarta also explains how she leads beings to
                    spiritual maturity through skillfully bringing them pleasure. Throughout the
                    exchange, the laywoman’s power and authority are highlighted by the fact that
                    periodically, at the close of particular passages of her teaching, members of
                    the audience attain significant levels of spiritual maturity.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-061-010-8"/>
                <p tid="11">Later in the sūtra, two of the laywoman’s young male disciples cross paths with
                    Subhūti. They explain the greatness of bodhisattvas in comparison to the hearers
                    and recite verses in praise of their teacher and her skillful means. This
                    skillfulness becomes strikingly clear when Strīvivarta assumes a handsome male
                    form, showing Subhūti the body with which she teaches women. With this, she
                    stuns the monk to the point that he admits he is at a loss for words; and once
                    again, he tries to leave to complete his alms rounds before it grows too late in
                    the day. In response, Strīvivarta confounds his sense of time by showing various
                    buddha realms in various times and by moving the sun’s position in the sky.
                    Convinced of the truth of her teachings, and no longer concerned about time,
                    Subhūti remains.</p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-061-010-9"/>
                <p tid="12">Following meaningful encounters with a celestial being and another inspiring
                    bodhisattva, Subhūti finally returns to the Buddha, to whom he relates his
                    experiences. The Buddha explains that the woman he encountered is in fact a
                    bodhisattva great being who benefits countless beings by skillfully bringing
                    them pleasure. Soon thereafter, the great bodhisattva herself arrives with a
                    large retinue of women. When Subhūti pays the woman homage, the senior monk
                    Śāriputra questions why he makes such a gesture of respect to a woman lacking
                    both the spiritual qualities and the body of a noble one. Strīvivarta then
                    proceeds to teach on what constitutes a noble being, the profound nature of the
                    Great Vehicle and its followers, and the unhindered confidence of bodhisattvas. </p>

                    according primacy to males, the focus on Strīvivarta in this scripture is
                    unusual and refreshing. Still, in the end Strīvivarta bows down at the Buddha’s
                    feet, saying that she will not rise again until she has received a prophecy of
                    her future awakening <emph>and</emph> has obtained a man’s body. The five
                    hundred women in her retinue do and say the same. In the Buddha’s prophecy that
                    follows, he says that in the bodhisattva’s future buddha realm “not even the
                    word <distinct>woman</distinct> will exist.” Upon receiving this prophecy,
                    Strīvivarta and the five hundred women rise into the air, overjoyed, and “take
                    on the appearance of sixteen-year-old boys.” The traditional stance on male
                    superiority thus seems to be, after all, reinstated. </p>

                    beyond Dharma and non-Dharma. The Dharma of mendicants is free from attachment
                    and nonattachment. The Dharma of mendicants is without objects, and it is not an
                    object. The Dharma of mendicants is without attachment; it is neither bound nor
                    liberated. The Dharma of mendicants is without mind; it is free from mind,
                    mentation, and consciousness. The Dharma of mendicants is contentment. The
                    Dharma of mendicants is letting go of jealousy and attachment. The Dharma of
                    mendicants is having little desire and being content. The Dharma of mendicants
                    is free from all desires. The Dharma of mendicants completely transcends all
                    objects, and it is without grasping. The Dharma of mendicants is definitely
                    freed from the demon of the aggregates. The Dharma of mendicants is without
                    afflictions; it has completely passed beyond the demon of the afflictions. The
                    Dharma of mendicants is unborn. The Dharma of mendicants is free from the demon
                    of the Lord of Death. The Dharma of mendicants is without deceit, arrogance, and
                    concepts; it is unobscured and unfettered. The Dharma of mendicants has
                    completely passed beyond the realm of the demons. The Dharma of mendicants is
                    free from adopting and discarding. The Dharma of mendicants is free from birth
                    and perishing. The Dharma of mendicants is not defiled by the demon of the gods.
                    The Dharma of mendicants is without mental engagement and entirely unsullied.
                    The Dharma of mendicants is without clinging, without marks, and free from all
                    marks. The Dharma of mendicants is not altered by any modes of elements and
                    nonelements; it is without enumeration, separation, and location, and it is
                    equal to space.”</p>

                    rather, he acts with loving-kindness toward them. Likewise, honorable Subhūti,

                    appropriate that they be attended by all beings. Nevertheless, those
                    bodhisattvas have an attitude of impartiality toward all those beings and do not
