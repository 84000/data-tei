                                                Sumāgadhā</title> opens at Prince Jeta’s Grove,
                                        Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, in Śrāvastī, where the Buddha is
                                        staying. At the time, Anāthapiṇḍada’s daughter Sumāgadhā is
                                        married off to Vṛṣabhadatta, the son of a nirgrantha
                                        merchant in the distant city of Puṇḍravardhana. After
                                        arriving at the home of her in-laws, Sumāgadhā is repulsed
                                        and disheartened on encountering the nirgrantha mendicants.
                                        When her mother-in-law asks why she seems despondent,
                                        Sumāgadhā tells her about the Buddha. At her mother-in-law’s
                                        request, she invites the Buddha and the saṅgha of monks for
                                        a meal, and she does so by preparing an offering and calling
                                        out from the rooftop. When Ānanda inquires about this
                                        invitation, the Buddha announces that all monks with <term rend="ignore">miraculous powers</term> must take a
                                        tally stick and travel to Puṇḍravardhana. As the śrāvakas
                                        arrive with their miraculous displays, Sumāgadhā relates a
                                        brief story about each of them. Finally, the Buddha arrives
                                        and converts the people of Puṇḍravardhana with his own
                                        miraculous display. When the monks ask how Sumāgadhā’s
                                        marriage has benefited so many beings, the Buddha relates
                                        the story of her past life as the princess Kāñcanamālā
                                        during the time of the Buddha Kāśyapa and, in turn,
                                        Kāñcanamālā’s past life as the virtuous wife of a farmer,
                                        explaining that she has performed buddha activity in the
                                        past and continues to do so. This sūtra also contains the
                                        popular account of the ten dreams of King Kṛkin, which are
                                        interpreted by the Buddha as foretelling the future decline
                                        of the Dharma. </p>

                                                matter and has been studied in painstaking detail.
                                                It will have to suffice here to offer a condensed
                                                summary of our understanding of the history of the

                                                translation found in the Kangyur. In short, there
                                                are several fragmentary Sanskrit manuscripts from
                                                Gilgit that predate the Tibetan translation,
                                                probably by three or four centuries, and present a
                                                text that appears quite similar to the hypothetical
                                                manuscript used for the Tibetan translation. Other
                                                Sanskrit manuscripts from Nepal postdate the Tibetan

                                                Dharmaśrībhadra is also said to have lived sometime
                                                during the late tenth to the mid-eleventh century,
                                                one may tentatively date the translation to the
                                                early eleventh century.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-075-004-87"> Kudo (2016, pp. 321
                                                  and 322) says that it was translated into Tibetan
                                                  in the eighth to ninth centuries, an estimate that
                                                  is also found in Iwamoto’s study (1968, p. 101)
                                                  and apparently adopted from there by Kudo.
                                                  However, it is unclear how this date was reached.
                                                  Iwamoto acknowledges that the translation was done
                                                  by Dharmaśrībhadra and Tsültrim Yönten, who are

                                                  centuries and, along with Rinchen Zangpo,
                                                  contributed to the later phase (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">phyi dar</foreign>)

                                                dating is the fact that the sūtra is not listed in

                                                translation—at least one that is not based on
                                                reconstruction—we have translated the sūtra based
                                                primarily on the Degé edition of the Tibetan

                                                manuscripts. Through this process we found that the
                                                Tibetan aligns quite closely but by no means
                                                perfectly with what is found in the Gilgit

                                                  may have referred to non-brahmanic ascetic orders.

                                                  translates as “one belonging to or associated with
                                                  (possessive suffix <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">-ika</foreign>) stairs for landing or
                                                  for descent into a river,” or “a bathing place,”
                                                  or “a place of pilgrimage on the banks of sacred
                                                  streams” (Monier-Williams). The term may have
                                                  originally referred to temple priests at river
                                                  crossings or fords where travelers propitiated a
                                                  deity before crossing. The Sanskrit term seems to
                                                  have undergone metonymic transfer in referring to
                                                  those able to ford the turbulent river of saṃsāra
                                                  (as in the Jain <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">tīrthaṅkaras</foreign>, “ford
                                                  makers”), and it came to be used in Buddhist
                                                  sources to refer to teachers of rival religious
                                                  traditions. The Sanskrit term is closely rendered
