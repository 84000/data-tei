                                        the Pali canon, the Buddha gives a teaching to Ānanda in
                                        which he confirms the suggestion that all negative
                                        experiences arise from being foolish, not from being
                                        learned, and goes on to summarize for Ānanda what
                                        distinguishes a learned person from a foolish one. The
                                        learned person, he says, is learned in the constituents
                                        (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">khams</foreign>, Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn" type="term">dhātu</foreign>), in the sense fields,

                                                  seems incomplete. In the Pali version (MN 115) the
                                                  analogy is clearer. As translated by Bhikkhu
                                                  Sujato (2018), “It’s like a fire that spreads from
                                                  a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even
                                                  a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free,
                                                  with latches fastened and windows
                                                  shuttered.”</note> In the same way, whatever fears
                                                arise, all of them arise from foolishness, not from
                                                being learned. Whatever calamity, whatever harm,
                                                contagious illness, or conflict arises, all of them
