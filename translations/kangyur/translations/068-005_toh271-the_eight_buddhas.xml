                    begins to shake. The sounds of innumerable cymbals are heard without their being
                    played, and flowers fall, covering the entire Jeta Grove. The world becomes
                    filled with golden light and golden lotuses appear, each lotus supporting a lion
                    throne upon which appears the shining form of a buddha. Venerable Śāriputra
                    arises from his seat, pays homage, and asks the Buddha about the causes and
                    conditions for these thus-gone ones to appear. 
                    The Buddha then proceeds to describe in detail these buddhas, as well as their various realms and how beings can take birth in them.</p>

                <p tid="6">In the Jeta Grove monastery outside Śrāvastī, the ancient capital of the Kośala
                    state, the Buddha and his saṅgha of monks have taken up residence during the
                    rainy season. Suddenly, during a gathering of the saṅgha, the whole universe
                    begins to shake, the grove is flooded with lights and sounds, and eight buddhas
                    miraculously appear on jeweled lotus flowers. The Buddha’s close disciple,
                    Śāriputra, requests the Buddha to explain the causes and conditions that have made
                    these buddhas appear. The Buddha begins by introducing Śāriputra to each of the
                    eight buddhas by name and then describes the location, name, and qualities of
                    each of their buddha realms. </p>
                <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-068-005-4"/>
                <p tid="7">Following this, the Buddha teaches Śāriputra how hearing, remembering, carrying,
                    reading, teaching, chanting, and mastering the names of these buddhas will
                    produce a great number of benefits for the practitioner. Śāriputra is told that
                    these names have the capacity to ensure that practitioners will not be reborn in the
                    three lower realms and that they will always have extraordinary knowledge,
                    realization, and dhāraṇī. They will never have defective faculties, lack
                    donations, or find themselves without the practices and discourses of the
                    Mahāyāna. They will also no longer have to take birth as women unless they wish
                    to do so, nor will they experience any misfortune caused by kings, thieves,
                    fire, water, or evil spirits. Eventually, they will attain wisdom, which
                    in turn will lead them to become buddhas themselves. </p>

                    <p tid="8">The notion that a disciple can become destined for awakening merely 
                        by recalling the names of buddhas who live in other realms appears in a number 
                        of Mahāyāna sūtras, where it represents an important aspect of Mahāyāna practice. 
                        In the Tibetan canon these sūtras are found throughout the various sūtra collections.
                     Not only is there a plethora of buddhas present in the universe, but through their
                    blessings, beings can make great progress on the path to awakening simply by
                    bringing them to mind.</p>

                <p tid="9">There is to our knowledge no extant Sanskrit version of this sūtra. According to
                    the colophon to the Tibetan translation it was translated into Tibetan by the Indian preceptors Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi,
                    along with the editor-translator Yeshé Dé. The text is also recorded in both the
                        Denkarma<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-068-005-7"> Denkarma, 279.b.3. See also Herrmann-Pfandt (2008), p.

                     catalogs of the Tibetan imperial translations, so it would have been
                    translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan no later than the early ninth century, as
                    the Denkarma is thought to have been compiled in 812 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. Four Chinese sūtras with cognate material are included in the
                    Taishō Buddhist Canon (Taishō 427, 428, 430, and 431).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-068-005-9"> See Lancaster (2018).</note>
                     The earliest of the Chinese translations (Taishō 427) dates to the early
                    third century, so the materials presented in this sūtra have their roots in
                    very early Indian Mahāyāna. </p>

                        Grove in the park of Anāthapiṇḍada with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks. They
                        were all worthy ones. Their contaminations were exhausted, they were without
                        afflictions, they were endowed with power, their minds were thoroughly
                        liberated, and their insight was thoroughly liberated. They were of noble
                        lineage. They were great elephants who had completed their work and accomplished their tasks.
                        They had put down their burdens, attained their own
