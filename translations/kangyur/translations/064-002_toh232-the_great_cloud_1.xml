                    <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud</title> features a long dialogue between the Buddha Śākyamuni and a bodhisattva named
                    Great Cloud Essence, who are periodically joined by various additional interlocutors from the vast audience of human and divine
                    beings who have assembled to hear the Buddha’s teaching. The topics of their conversation are diverse and wide-ranging, but a
                    central theme is the vast conduct of bodhisattvas, which is illustrated through the enumeration of the various meditative states
                    and liberative techniques that bodhisattvas must master in order to minister to all sentient beings. This is followed by a
                    conversation with the brahmin Kauṇḍinya concerning the Buddha’s cousin Devadatta, who is revealed to be a bodhisattva displaying
                    the highest level of skillful means. Kauṇḍinya then inquires about the possibility of obtaining a relic from the Buddha, and
                    another member of the audience responds with an explanation of how truly rare it is for a buddha relic to appear within the world.
                    Finally, the discourse ends with the Buddha delivering a series of detailed prophecies describing the principal interlocutor’s
                    future attainment of buddhahood, and he further explains the benefits and powers that can be obtained through the practice of this
                    sūtra itself.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud</title> is an important Mahāyāna sūtra, known particularly as one source of the
                        idea that a tathāgata is permanent and does not really pass into parinirvāṇa, but strategically displays an illusory body. To
                        exemplify religious attainment for sentient beings, this emanated body seems to take birth, strive for awakening, and
                        eventually pass into parinirvāṇa.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-064-002-1682">Such views comprise one element of
                            Buddha-nature theory associated with the Buddha’s “third turning of the wheel of Dharma” (see below), but also stem from
                            the theory of the emanation body (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nirmāṇakāya</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sprul pa’i
                                sku</foreign>) that may have first developed in non-Mahāyāna schools. They have been compared by scholars in the
                            modern era to similar views about Jesus Christ in docetism, a second century belief rejected as heretical by the early
                            Church councils. On “docetic Buddhism” see Anesaki (1911), Seyfort-Ruegg (2008) pp. 31–34, and Radich (2015).</note> In
                        this sūtra this view is not merely implied or stated without comment, as it is in many sūtras, but is set out along with the
                        claim that orthodox Buddhist doctrines of impermanence and selflessness are merely provisional teachings imparted by the
                        Buddha for the sake of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who were too trepidatious and spiritually immature to accept the realities
                        of permanence and true selfhood. </p>

                        human and nonhuman beings who were in attendance when the discourse was spoken. This section, which takes up the entirety of
                        the first fascicle and continues into the second fascicle, is one of the longest and most detailed introductions to be found
                        in any Mahāyāna sūtra. The scripture goes on to introduce the primary interlocutor, a bodhisattva named Great Cloud Essence,
                        who emerges from the assembly to ask the Buddha a long series of questions on a variety of topics related to the conduct of
                        bodhisattvas. The Buddha praises the bodhisattva’s questions and responds by introducing <title xml:lang="en">The Great
                            Cloud</title>, which is described as the “steadfast treasury of the sacred Dharma.” Great Cloud Essence asks for more
                        teachings on this topic, and the Buddha grants his request, which prompts a great display of miraculous signs, eliciting
                        praise for the Buddha’s qualities from the entire assembly.</p>

                        qualities. These qualities correspond to the questions asked by Great Cloud Essence in the first chapter. The Buddha then
                        proceeds to enumerate the remaining samādhis and repeats all the qualities enumerated for the first samādhi, explaining that
                        they apply likewise to all the other samādhi gateways.</p>

                        structure: Great Cloud Essence asks the Bhagavān to enumerate a series of techniques or “gateways”—dhāraṇī gateways,
                        liberation gateways, Dharma gateways, etc.—related to a single theme. The Buddha then lists those gateways, and a member of
                        the audience steps forth, makes offerings, and offers a short praise of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>

                    <p tid="14">In the penultimate chapter, chapter 37, Great Cloud Essence asks again about the four hundred samādhi gateways, and
                        the Buddha responds with a long discussion of the various practices to be performed by bodhisattvas who cultivate the
                        teachings of <title xml:lang="en">The Great Cloud</title>. An important theme of this section is that bodhisattvas must engage

                        engaging in all manner of activities that might be considered contrary to the Dharma, such as having a family, accumulating
                        wealth, and associating with non-Buddhists and people of questionable ethics.</p>

                    <p tid="15">Following this discussion, we are introduced to another interlocutor, the brahmin Kauṇḍinya, who steps forth to
                        question the Buddha specifically about the Buddha’s cousin Devadatta. Kauṇḍinya condemns the conduct of Devadatta and the
                        so-called “group of six monks,” who are always finding ways to break the rules of pure conduct set forth by the Buddha.
                        However, Great Cloud Essence, speaking on behalf of the Buddha, chides Kauṇḍinya for his views and explains that Devadatta and
                        the group of six are really bodhisattvas displaying skillful means. Following this, Kauṇḍinya requests the Buddha to grant him
                        the boon of a relic that he can venerate. A Licchavi youth steps forward from the audience and explains to Kauṇḍinya just how
                        rare it is for a buddha relic to appear in the world. Then, a goddess named <term ref="UT22084-064-002-1128">Stainless
                            Light</term> steps forth and asks the Buddha about the brahmin and the Licchavi. The Buddha proceeds to explain that these
                        two beings have been karmically connected for many eons, describe their former activities, and give a prophecy of their future
                        attainment of buddhahood. The Buddha then gives further prophecies for these two individuals and for the goddess <term ref="UT22084-064-002-1128">Stainless Light</term> and the bodhisattva Great Cloud Essence. Most notably, Kauṇḍinya is to
                        be reborn as the Mauryan king Aśoka.</p>

                    <p tid="16">The final chapter, chapter 38, continues this theme of prophecies, as a host of gods questions the Buddha about the
                        future fate of this discourse. The Buddha explains that in the future there will be many people who will question the
                        authenticity and legitimacy of this discourse and its teachings. However, there will arise one monk who will defend the sūtra
                        and spread its teachings, and due to his dedication, the teachings will not disappear. The Buddha goes on to describe the
                        merits that will come from practicing the teachings of this discourse. A series of marvels then occurs, including the
                        appearance of a great light from the western region, and, when questioned by Great Cloud Essence, the Buddha describes all the

                        of eons with the utmost concentration, it is unfounded to say that they would find the conception of a sentient being. To give
                        an analogy, it is like a king among his queen and her retinue who is seen leaving his palace to go to another place. It would
                        be unfounded to say that he is still among his queen and her retinue. Similarly, it would be unfounded to say that bodhisattva

                        afflictions, are still within existence and have become defiled by its faults for the sake of sentient beings’ welfare.</p>

                        Yet you should cultivate the conception that the Buddhadharma will abide for an exceptionally long time. Bodhisattvas who

                        will be no mountains, boulders, dirt, pebbles, gravel, and the like. Even the name <distinct>non-Buddhist</distinct> will not
                        exist, and the names <distinct>śrāvaka</distinct> and <distinct>pratyekabuddha</distinct> will not be heard. All men and women
                        will join the bodhisattva saṅgha. There will be no mention or knowledge of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, but reports of
                        the Great Vehicle discourses will spread far and wide. There will appear sentient beings who will triumph over Māra and all
                        hostile forces. <ref cRef="F.214.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-064-002-1667"/> There will appear many who will attain the
                        discoveries of purity and great acceptance. The ground will be made from all variety of precious jewels, and the Jambu river
                        will be lined with golden flowers and all kinds of lotus blossoms. The Tathāgata’s lifespan will be unfathomable, and
                        similarly the lifespan of all humans will be incalculable. The Tathāgata will abide in the city Fragrant Purity. I say that
                        through that bhagavān’s special aspiration, in the future the entire great throng of sentient beings who simply hear of that
                        tathāgata’s characteristics will, after they pass away from their current body, be born directly within the city Fragrant
                        Purity in the world system of Refined Purity. They will not be destined for the domains of the four unpleasant rebirths.</p>
