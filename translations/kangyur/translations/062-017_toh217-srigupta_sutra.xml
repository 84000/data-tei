                    Śākyamuni Buddha. At his guru’s instigation, a wealthy young Jain named Śrīgupta invites the Buddha
                    to the midday meal at his house in Rājagṛha, where he has secretly prepared a fire trap and a
                    poisoned meal. The Buddha is aware of these plans, but instead of simply avoiding the trap he accepts the invitation 
                    and uses the occasion to demonstrate his invulnerability to such harms, due to his realization
                    and the power of his past deeds. He tells three stories from his previous lives as a pheasant
                    chick, a hare, and the peacock king Suvarṇāvabhāsa—lives in which he similarly overcame fire and
                    poison. After Śrīgupta’s attempts fail, Śākyamuni recounts yet another of his former lives in which
                    Śrīgupta, this time as a brahmin teacher, similarly attempted to trap him in a pit of fire. Ashamed
                    of his actions, Śrīgupta apologizes for his mistakes, takes refuge, and receives the vows of a lay
                    devotee in the Buddha’s community.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Śrīgupta Sūtra</title> tells the story of a plot to kill Śākyamuni Buddha
                        by fire and poison, a narrative that frames four additional stories of the Buddha’s past lives
                        that demonstrate examples of his invulnerability. In the framing narrative, the assassination
                        attempt is carried out by the titular Śrīgupta. He is ordered to kill the Buddha by his Jain
                        teacher, Jñātiputra, who disputes Śākyamuni’s claim to omniscience. However, because the Buddha
                        is in fact omniscient, he sees through the plot and uses it as an opportunity to bring
                        Śrīgupta to the Buddhist path. In its broad strokes, this story is similar to the one found in
                        the <title xml:lang="Pi-Ltn">Dhammapada-aṭṭhakathā</title>, a fourth- or fifth-century
                        Pali scriptural commentary.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk" xml:id="UT22084-062-017-7"/>
                    <p tid="11">Interwoven with the dramatic narrative of the assassination attempt are scenes in which the
                        Buddha recounts four of his past lives: as a pheasant chick, a hare, the peacock king
                        Suvarṇāvabhāsa, and a young brahmin boy named Dharmakāma. Each of these stories is told to
                        demonstrate why Śrīgupta’s plot was doomed to fail; but on a deeper level, each one underscores
                        the infallibility of the consequences—good and bad—of actions from one’s previous lives. </p>

                    <p tid="12">The third of these vignettes is particularly noteworthy for recounting the tale of Śākyamuni’s
                        previous incarnation as Suvarṇāvabhāsa, a peacock king who similarly escaped a plot to poison
                        him. Stories of Suvarṇāvabhāsa appear throughout the Buddhist literature, and though they can
                        differ substantially, they generally share the feature of Suvarṇāvabhāsa’s escape from some kind
                        of snare or attempt on his life through the recitation of a series of verses, a dhāraṇī, or a
                        mantra.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-062-017-9"> See for example the story of Suvarṇāvabhāsa told in <ref target="https://read.84000.co/translation/toh1-6.html#UT22084-001-006-7417">

                            incantation to be used in the case of poisoning. </note>
                        The version of the story found in <title xml:lang="en">The Śrīgupta Sūtra</title> is unique, but
                        it too includes a series of verses that can be recited over food to neutralize any poisons it
                        may contain. In this sūtra, once the Buddha has finished the story of his life as Suvarṇāvabhāsa
                        and his escape from death by poisoning, he gives Śrīgupta a liturgy to recite over the food he
                        has poisoned, thus rendering it safe for the Buddha and his monks to eat. It is possible that
                        this series of verses may have been intended to be extracted for use in a more general
                        apotropaic fashion to avert poisoning. </p>

Among various explanations given for the continent being so named, one (in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Abhidharmakośa</title>) is that a jambu tree grows in its northern mountains beside Lake Anavatapta, mythically considered the source of the four great rivers of India, and that the continent is therefore named from the tree or the fruit. Jambudvīpa has the vajrāsana at its center and is the only continent upon which buddhas attain awakening.</term>
