                    <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Brahmaviśeṣacintin</title> is an important Mahāyāna sūtra that
                    has enjoyed significant popularity in Buddhist India, China, and Tibet over the centuries. The
                    setting for this teaching is the Veṇuvana Monastery on the outskirts of Rājagṛha, the capital city
                    in the country of Magadha. The teaching itself takes the form of a lively discussion between the
                    Buddha and several bodhisattvas, such as Brahmaviśeṣacintin, Jālinīprabha, and Mañjuśrī, as well as
                    elders, such as Śāriputra and Mahākāśyapa, and even various gods who attend the teaching. This sūtra
                    blends practical and theoretical strains of Mahāyāna and emphasizes how bodhisattvas should practice
                    the Dharma—a training that transcends both the mundane and the supramundane. Indeed, although this
                    sūtra stresses the importance of “donning the armor of diligence,” this practice must unfold within
                    the context of the view of emptiness. The bodhisattva is therefore directed to make every effort to
                    help all beings, while realizing that in actuality there is no action, no actor, and no recipient.
                    As with many Mahāyāna sūtras, this text does not aim at a systematic presentation of doctrine,<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-059-003-4"> The text lacks a unifying thematic or narrative
                            structure. In an attempt to order the material, the Korean rendering of Kumārajīva’s
                            translation divides the text into eighteen chapters, although the original Sanskrit was most
                            likely devoid of such chapter headings. These are also absent from the Tibetan manuscript,
                            which merely divides the text into six sections (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">bam
                                po</foreign>). However, such divisions in the Tibetan translations refer merely to units
                            of translated material and as such they do not indicate topical divisions within the text
                            itself.</note> but rather at evoking the nature and scope of awakening by means of
                    pertinent conversations and illustrations. The text presents many well-known Dharma topics,
                    including the four truths, the six perfections, and the Three Jewels, all from a Mahāyāna
                    perspective that emphasizes the view of emptiness.</p>

                    Kumārajīva (T. 586), and Bodhiruci (T. 587). Moreover, Kumārajīva’s translation has been further
                    translated into Korean (K. 143).<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-059-003-7"> See:
                            http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/index.html. Kumārajīva’s translation (with
                            comparison to other Chinese renderings and the Tibetan translation) has been translated into

                                translations of, this sūtra in Japanese. We have
                            not consulted Goshima’s publications due to language
                            limitations on our part. For publication details see

                    Dharmarakṣa, which is dated as early as 286 <hi rend="small-caps">ce</hi>. This suggests that this
                    scripture is a fairly early example of Indian Mahāyāna literature. The fact that the three Chinese
                    translations of this scripture were made over several centuries indicates that the sūtra enjoyed a
                    sustained popularity in China.<note place="end" xml:id="UT22084-059-003-8"> Kumārajīva’s

                    later during the early translation period of the ninth century, when most Mahāyāna sūtras were

                    Dharmatāśīla is the best known, as he was a senior editor of several sūtra translations and one of
                    the main editors involved in the compilation of the first authoritative Sanskrit-Tibetan dictionary,

                    neither saṃsāric features nor those of nirvāṇa. Why not? Blessed One, to become a buddha, there

                    the domain of the world, they [F.38.a] can speak of the world, the origin of the world, the
                    cessation of the world, and the path that leads to the cessation of the world. Brahmā, the
                        <distinct>world</distinct> refers to the five aggregates. Any attachment to them is the origin
                    of the world. The exhaustion and cessation of the aggregates corresponds to the cessation of the
                    world, while the path is the nonduality of searching and not searching for the aggregates.
                    Furthermore, Brahmā, what we call the <distinct>aggregates</distinct> are merely different
                    designations. The <distinct>world</distinct> is these words and conceptualizations. To pursue these
                    conceptualizations is the <distinct>origin</distinct> of the world. The genuine cessation of these
                    conceptualizations is the <distinct>cessation</distinct> of the world. The path through which one
                    stops grasping on to these conceptions is the <distinct>path</distinct> that leads to the cessation
                    of the world. Brahmā, having reflected about this, I have designated, in relation to this
                    six-foot-tall body, the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world, and the path
                    that leads to the cessation of the world.”</p>

                <p tid="239">The Blessed One replied, “Brahmā, <distinct>suffering</distinct> is not a truth of the noble ones.
                    Brahmā, <distinct>the origin of suffering</distinct>, <distinct>the cessation of
                        suffering</distinct>, and <distinct>the path that leads to the cessation of suffering</distinct>
                    are not the truths of the noble ones. Why not? Brahmā, if <distinct>suffering</distinct> were a
                    truth of the noble ones, then beasts of burden, like oxen and donkeys, along with all beings in the
                    hell realms, would likewise experience the truth of the noble ones. Why? Because they experience
                    sensations of suffering. Brahmā, if <distinct>the origin of suffering</distinct> [F.38.b] were a
                    truth of the noble ones, then all beings, who are born in existences that originate in various ways,
                    would also be experiencing the reality of the noble ones. If <distinct>the cessation of
                        suffering</distinct> were a truth of the noble ones, then all those who are seeking nirvāṇa by
                    annihilating things and all the proponents of nihilistic views, who fall into the view of cessation,
                    would also be experiencing the truth of the noble ones. If <distinct>the path</distinct> were a
                    truth of the noble ones, then all those who pursue conditioned phenomena, which arise from further
                    conditioned elements, and focus on a conditioned path would also see the truth of the noble ones.
                    Therefore, Brahmā, through this instruction, you should know that suffering, its origin, its
                    cessation, and the path are not the truths of the noble ones. Rather, Brahmā, it is a truth of the
                    noble ones that suffering is unborn. It is a truth of the noble ones that no origin should be
                    engaged with. It is a truth of the noble ones that in the complete cessation of all phenomena, they
                    neither arise nor cease. It is a truth of the noble ones to train on the path where all phenomena
                    are equality and nondual.</p>

                    These are deviations from remembering the words of the Buddha. That is why they are falsehoods. What

                    you dwell on the limit of reality. When you dwell on the limit of reality, there is no conceptual
                    mind. When there is no dwelling in this way, there is neither truthful speech nor any deceptive
                    speech. This is why, Brahmā, according to this instruction, you should know that the truth of the
                    noble ones is that which is neither true nor false. Brahmā, these <distinct>truths</distinct> are
                    never falsehoods. Whether thus-gone ones appear or not, the realm of phenomena prevails. Likewise,
                    saṃsāra and nirvāṇa also are forever the truths of the noble ones. Why? Brahmā, the truths of the
                    noble ones are not there to abandon saṃsāra. The truths of the noble ones are not there to attain
                    nirvāṇa. Brahmā, if someone realizes and actualizes the four truths of the noble ones in this way,

                    Dharma to beings. The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for others, which has thirty-two
                    aspects. They are: (1) All phenomena are devoid of a self, but beings are not interested in
                    selflessness; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (2) All phenomena
                    are devoid of beings, yet beings call themselves <distinct>beings</distinct>; this is why the
                    thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (3) All phenomena are devoid of a life principle,
                    but beings think that a life principle exists; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great
                    compassion for beings. (4) All phenomena are devoid of an individual, [F.46.a] but beings remain
                    fixated on an individual; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (5) All
                    phenomena are devoid of inherent nature, but beings see a real nature; this is why the thus-gone
                    ones arouse great compassion for beings. (6) All phenomenon are without foundation, but beings rely
                    on foundations; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (7) All phenomena
                    are devoid of a a substratum, but beings take delight in a substratum; this is why the thus-gone
                    ones arouse great compassion for beings. (8) All phenomena are devoid of something to hold as mine,
                    but beings are fixated on holding to things as mine; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great
                    compassion for beings. (9) All phenomena are devoid of an owner, but beings strive to hold on to
                    things; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (10) All phenomena are
                    unreal, but beings rely on things as real; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion
                    for beings. (11) All phenomena are unborn, but beings remain fixated on birth; this is why the
                    thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (12) All phenomena are devoid of transference and
                    rebirth, but beings hold on to death, transference, and birth; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse
                    great compassion for beings. (13) All phenomena are devoid of factors of pollution, but beings are
                    polluted; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (14) All phenomena are
                    devoid of desire, but beings are full of attachment; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great
                    compassion for beings. (15) All phenomena are devoid of aversion, but beings are full of aversion;
                    [F.46.b] this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (16) All phenomena are
                    devoid of ignorance, but beings are dull; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for
                    beings. (17) All phenomena are devoid of coming, but beings are fixated on coming; this is why the
                    thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (18) All phenomena are devoid of going, but
                    beings are fixated on coming; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings.
                    (19) All phenomena are devoid of formation, but beings experience formation; this is why the
                    thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (20) All phenomena are devoid of conceptual
                    elaborations, but beings delight in conceptual elaborations; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse
                    great compassion for beings. (21) All phenomena are emptiness, but beings hold on to views; this is
                    why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings. (22) All phenomena are signlessness, but
                    beings’ experiences involve signs; this is why the thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for
                    beings. (23) All phenomena are wishlessness, but beings have aspirations; this is why the thus-gone
                    ones arouse great compassion for beings. (24) The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings
                    by thinking, ‘Alas, the denizens of this world always fight and rage with malevolence; therefore, I
                    will teach them the Dharma, so that they can abandon the fault of raging with malevolence.’ (25) The

                    have wrong perceptions and follow perilous routes and mistaken paths; therefore, I shall set them
                    upon the right path.’ [F.47.a] (26) The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings by
                    thinking, ‘Alas, the denizens of this world are overcome by greed and craving, they know no
                    contentment, and they carry off others’ belongings; therefore, I shall establish them in the riches
                    of the noble ones—faith, discipline, learning, generosity, insight, dignity, and propriety.’ (27)
                    The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings by thinking, ‘Alas, beings are oppressed by
                    their craving for wealth, harvests, houses, sons, and wives, holding on to their reality although
                    there are no such things; therefore, I shall teach them how everything is impermanent.’ (28) The
                    thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings by thinking, ‘Alas, beings gain their subsistence
                    through ignorance and deceiving one another; therefore, I shall teach them the Dharma, so that they
                    may live by the right livelihood.’ (29) The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings by
                    thinking, ‘Alas, beings do not like each other, but pretend to be close for gain and praises;
                    therefore, I shall become a genuine spiritual friend who leads them to nirvāṇa, the delightful
                    pacification of all suffering.’ (30) The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion for beings by
                    thinking, ‘Alas, the denizens of this world are overwhelmed by disturbing emotions and delight in
                    family life, which is the source of so much suffering; therefore, I shall teach them the Dharma, to
                    extricate them from the three realms of existence.’ (31) The thus-gone ones arouse great compassion
                    for beings by thinking, ‘All phenomena arise from causes—this is their defining characteristic—but
                    beings are idle when it comes to work at the liberation of the noble ones.’ (32) The thus-gone ones
                    arouse great compassion for beings by thinking, ‘There are beings who reject the perfect nirvāṇa,
                    the supreme wisdom of the buddhas, which is devoid of attachment, and instead seek the lower
                    vehicles of hearers [F.47.b] and solitary buddhas. I shall inspire them toward the vast, so that
                    they may turn their attention toward the wisdom of the buddhas.’</p>

                    ignorance. (7) Since they are unborn from the beginning, all phenomena are without coming. (8) Since
                    they are devoid of transference, all phenomena are without going. (9) Since they are thoroughly
                    without a basis, all phenomena are without abiding. (10) Since they do not arise in the past,

                    phenomena have no distinctions. (12) Since they are free from the ripening of karma, all phenomena
                    are unborn. (13) Since no agent can be found, all phenomena are devoid of karma and its ripening.
                    (14) Since they do not involve formation, all phenomena are devoid of activity. (15) Since they

                    phenomena are not real. (18) Since all things can be realized at once, all phenomena are true. (19)
                    Since no sentient being can be identified, all phenomena are devoid of individual identity. (20)
                    Because of the ultimate, all phenomena are devoid of personal identity. (21) Since they are unable

                    devoid of disturbing emotions, phenomena do not perpetuate disturbing emotions. (25) Since they are
                    the ultimate isolation, all phenomena are the same. (26) Since they are the fullness of isolation,
                    all phenomena are in isolation. (27) Since they are without disturbance, all phenomena abide within
                    the limit of reality. (28) Since they are without difference, all phenomena are suchness. (29) Since
                    they conform to everything, all phenomena are included within the realm of phenomena. (30) Since
                    they do not interfere with each other, all phenomena are devoid of conditions. (31) Since great
                    equality makes them unfold, all phenomena are dependently originated. (32) Since they are revealed
                    when seen as they are, all phenomena are awakening. (33) Since they are not established, all
                    phenomena are nirvāṇa.</p>

                    million thus-gone ones came. I paid homage to them, venerated them, worshiped them, and made
                    offerings to them; yet none of these thus-gone ones gave me the prophecy. Then, Brahmā, there
                    followed the eon called Praised by Brahma, during which eighteen thousand thus-gone ones came. I
                    paid homage to them, venerated them, worshiped them, and made offerings to them; yet none of these

                    generosity. To pacify all reification is the perfection of discipline. To be unchanged by objects is
                    the perfection of patience. To leave all phenomena alone is the perfection of diligence. To not

                    reality, the Dharma as freedom from desire, and the Saṅgha as what is unconditioned. Further, noble
                    son, presenting the Dharma consists in formulating the four applications of mindfulness. Keeping the
                    noble silence consists in neither reflecting upon nor mentally engaging in any phenomena. Presenting
                    the Dharma consists in applying the four correct abandonments. Keeping the noble silence consists in
                    transcending similarity or dissimilarity on the basis of equality. Presenting the Dharma consists in
                    applying the four bases of miraculous powers. Keeping the noble silence consists in making no
                    deliberate efforts with body, speech, or mind. Presenting the Dharma consists in applying the five
                    powers and the five strengths. Keeping the noble silence consists in not having any faith in any
                    phenomena due to faith in objects, and neither accepting nor rejecting any phenomena. Keeping the
                    noble silence also consists in being dedicated to maintaining mindfulness, one-pointed
                    concentration, freedom from vain thoughts, and resting naturally in the equality of all things—which
                    becomes the condition for not relying on any conceptual elaboration. Presenting the Dharma consists
                    in applying the seven elements of awakening. Keeping the noble silence consists in remaining,
                    through meditative equipoise, in a state without postulation, devoid of any superimpositions or
                    anything to acquire or remove. Presenting the Dharma consists in applying the eightfold path of the
                    noble ones. . [F.72.b] Keeping the noble silence consists in not being dependent either on Dharma or
                    non-Dharma through realizing that the Dharma is like a raft.</p>

                    that is presenting the Dharma. In this way, when the Dharma is experienced directly, one does not

                    seeing of the direct perception of wisdom is not seeing. This not seeing anything is keeping the

                    impute the Dharma, or impute non-Dharma—this is presenting the Dharma. To remain unmoved, without

                    bodhisattvas taught extensively the meaning of presenting the Dharma and keeping the noble silence.
                    At that time, the seven million two hundred thousand Brahmā gods gained acceptance that phenomena

                    Noble son, the two bodhisattvas, who had uninterrupted eloquence, then taught correctly about
                    presenting the Dharma and keeping the noble silence. They taught for seventy-six thousand years,
                    elucidating these two topics and [F.76.b] answering the gods’ questions, with no end to their

                    echoes, for all words are like reverberating sounds. You should understand that the unfailing
                    mastery of eloquence that you have realized is also this way. Should you wish to explain these two
                    topics for an eon or more, your eloquence would still not be exhausted. Nevertheless, the words of
                    the buddhas are complete peacefulness; they are peace, utter peace, complete peace, the meaning
                    beyond words, and the ineffable meaning. The more this is expressed, the further it is from the
                    meaning. Therefore, rely on the meaning and not the words.’ The two bodhisattvas heard that
                    thus-gone one’s exhortation and remained silent. Noble son, based on this explanation you should
                    know that bodhisattvas can teach eloquently in this way for a hundred thousand eons or more. Noble
                    son, you should not think that at that time, on that occasion, these two bodhisattvas were some

                    prophesy my awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood. Likewise, I paid homage to the masters,
                    worshiped them, stayed in solitude, listened to many teachings, and did everything I could for
                    beings; but despite striving diligently in this way, I did not receive my prophecy. Why not? Because
                    my diligence was based on physical, verbal, and mental effort. Brahmā, once I acquired the diligence
                    the divine son just described for us, the Thus-Gone One Dīpaṃkara gave me my prophecy. He said,
                    ‘Brahmin child, in the future, you will become a thus-gone, worthy, and perfect buddha by the name
                    of Śākyamuni.’ Brahmā, in this way, the bodhisattvas who wish to quickly reach the level of the

                    pristine, clear, and without impurity. Any impure water merging with it will not retain its

                    of eloquence, as they retain the blessings of the buddhas. (9) The strength of the profound, as they
