                <p tid="2">Heralded by a miraculous flood, the celestial bodhisattva Sāgaramati arrives in Rājagṛha to engage in a Dharma discussion
                    with Buddha Śākyamuni. He discusses an absorption called “The Pristine and Immaculate Seal” and many other subjects relevant to
                    bodhisattvas who are in the process of developing the mind of awakening and practicing the bodhisattva path. The sūtra strongly
                    advises that bodhisattvas not shy away from the afflictive emotions of beings—no matter how unpleasant they may be—and that
                    insight into these emotions is critical for a bodhisattva’s compassionate activity. The sūtra deals with the preeminence of wisdom
                    and non-grasping on the path. In the end, as a teaching on how to deal with māras, the sūtra illuminates the many pitfalls
                    possible on the path of the Great Vehicle.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="en">The Questions of Sāgaramati</title> begins in a courtyard in the city of Rājagṛha, where the
                        Buddha Śākyamuni, a celestial bodhisattva named Sāgaramati, and many other gods and bodhisattvas converse on a wide variety of
                        subjects relevant to the Great Vehicle. Sāgaramati’s arrival in our world is preceded by a great miracle in which the world is
                        flooded like a vast ocean, a miracle prompted by Sāgaramati’s departure from a distant realm for our world, where he can
                        receive the Buddha’s teachings in person. The conversation between the Buddha Śākyamuni and Sāgaramati in Rājagṛha touches on
                        many issues of the bodhisattva path. They converse about the adversities that bodhisattvas must face, the preeminence of
                        wisdom, how māras are to be defeated, the necessity of understanding the afflictive emotions of sentient beings, the
                        importance of diligence, the commonalities between all phenomena and buddhahood, the nature of the Dharma, and the importance
                        of dedication. Much of the dialogue presupposes a duality between agents and objects, but at times Mañjuśrī and other exalted
                        beings challenge this and articulate the teachings in the light of the wisdom of nonduality. </p>

                        spoken by someone else they bring the following to mind: ‘This person has long been stingy and miserly. His life revolves
                        around this stain of stinginess, such that he has now also developed malice. As such, he does not follow spiritual friends who
                        can teach him the Dharma, nor does he respect or serve them. As for myself, I must remain inspired to give and not be stingy.

                        malicious. I will uphold the mind of awakening. I will trust in the ripening of karma.’ This is their perfection of

                        sources are the basis. As their minds are mistaken in this regard, beings perceive what is impermanent to be permanent, what
                        is suffering to be happiness, what is not a self to be a self, and what is ugly to be attractive. Now, so that they may come

                        all phenomena are disengaged. Because all phenomena are empty, the qualities of buddhahood are realized as emptiness. Brahmā,
                        because all phenomena are dependently originated, realizing dependent origination is awakening. The qualities of buddhahood
                        are seen by a thus-gone one in the same way that all phenomena are seen.”</p>

                    <p tid="1094">“Noble son,” asked Mahābrahma Great Compassionate One, “do the qualities of buddhahood not transcend the three
                        realms?”</p>

                    <p tid="1095">“Brahmā,” replied Sāgaramati, “the essential quality of the three realms is to possess the qualities of buddhahood.
                        Why is this? Brahmā, in the sameness of the qualities of buddhahood, there is no better or worse. Analogously, Brahmā, in
                        space there is no better or worse. Likewise, Brahmā, the qualities of buddhahood are equal to space, wherein there is nothing
                        better or worse. Brahmā, the nature of all phenomena is that they are empty by their very nature, meaning there is nothing
                        better or worse. Brahmā, a noble son or daughter who wishes to realize the qualities of buddhahood should realize the
                        qualities of buddhahood in a nonconceptual manner. Furthermore, Brahmā, the qualities of buddhahood do not persist in objects,
                        nor in any direction. They are unborn and unceasing. They are not like the colors blue, <ref cRef="F.47.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-001-3100"/> yellow, red, white, green, crystal, or silver; in fact, they have no color, shape, or

                        powers. Excellent, excellent! There are no qualities of buddhahood that could intimidate a bodhisattva who has this kind of
                        power. All the sounds of this teaching by Sāgaramati are terrifying. Ultimate awakening is inexpressible. Why is this? What is
                        inexpressible cannot be explained and does not conform with letters. If the mind and mental phenomena themselves cannot be
                        formed, how could they possibly conform to letters? This profound teaching is beyond language, unexplainable, inexpressible,

                        of language. Just consider how the great compassion of the blessed buddhas can be introduced to an unfathomable number of
                        beings. Sāgaramati, to draw an analogy, imagine that somebody painted an image with various colors on space, which is
                        formless, inexpressible, unobstructing, and uncognizable. Imagine that this person painted horses, elephants, chariots,
                        infantrymen, and mounts, or that they painted an image of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas. Sāgaramati, do you think that

                    <p tid="1518">“To draw an analogy, let us imagine, Blessed One, that a person who lived near a town, village, or city happened
                        upon a hitherto undiscovered, immense treasure of all types of jewels, and that this person was someone who was very helpful
                        to others. Having discovered that treasure, he then went to the town, village, or city with the intention to inform the public
                        and said, ‘Everyone, come here! I will show this inexhaustible deposit to whoever needs jewels!’ Blessed One, some trusted him
                        and some did not. The ones who trusted him went to the deposit. For some, there were as many jewels as they had strength to
                        carry. For some, there were as many jewels as they could imagine. Yet the deposit itself had no concepts as to bestowing or
                        not bestowing, or that it was appropriate to give to some and not to others. Why is this? Because, Blessed One, this deposit
                        held no concepts.</p>

                        eons, whereupon he awakened to perfect buddhahood at the seat of awakening. <ref cRef="F.72.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-001-3150"/> He then turned the immense and precious wheel of Dharma in the city of Vārāṇasī at the
                        Hill of Fallen Sages. In the same manner the Blessed One opened the unsurpassed and precious treasure of this collection of
                        Dharma teachings. The Blessed One developed great compassion for all beings with no distinction. Arousing beneficial means, he
                        spoke to the world of gods, humans, and asuras with the voice of Brahmā that engenders understanding, saying, ‘Come! Take
                        possession of this unsurpassed and immense treasure of the precious Dharma that is inexhaustible, bestows all <term type="ignore">forms</term> of happiness, and transports one to the end of birth, aging, sickness, and death.’ Responding
                        to your attempt to engender understanding, Blessed One, some beings who were stupid and had no faith were not inspired,
                        interested, thoughtful, or trusting. Those whose nature was capable of faith were inspired, interested, thoughtful, and
                        trusting. They partook what they could of the Thus-Gone One’s immense treasure of the precious Dharma. He explained the
                        vehicle that inspired them. Some entered seeking the state of hearers, solitary buddhas, or unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
                        Yet, the Thus-Gone One’s unsurpassed and immense treasure of the precious Dharma had no concepts about anyone.</p>

                        revelation even slightly will lose these jewels and find themselves bereft of them. They will find themselves in the three
                        lower realms for a long time. Blessed One, if anyone who upholds even a single four-line verse of this immense treasure of the
                        precious Dharma will become wealthy and receive the seven riches of noble beings, then what need have we to speak of those who
                        uphold a complete chapter of this collection of Dharma teachings—or two, three, <ref cRef="F.73.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-001-3151"/> four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy chapters, or the entire
                        teaching? The extent of those sublime beings’ merit could not be fathomed. Blessed One, anyone who has not lost the mind of
                        awakening and is moved by great compassion for beings, and who then upholds, retains, reads, understands, and teaches it
                        extensively to others, will be prophesied to awaken to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. They will defeat the māras and gain
                        attainment of super-knowledge within this Great Vehicle.”</p>

                        upholds it, reads it, masters it, and accomplishes it will alight upon the seat of awakening. You see how they possess all

                        phenomena are unborn in the manner of non-attainment and non-observation. As soon as I attained that acceptance, I floated
                        upwards to the height of seven palm trees. While present in the midst of space, I considered the endowment of omniscient
                        wisdom. All views ended. I transcended all thoughts, concepts, and notions, and my consciousness no longer dwelled on any
                        objects. I actualized sixty thousand absorptions. The blessed thus-gone Dīpaṃkara then gave the following prophecy: ‘Young
                        brahmin, in the future you will become the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha Śākyamuni.’ My ear faculty did not hear this
                        prophecy, nor did I cognize it through some wisdom. But I was also not deluded, and nor did I maintain any view of reference
                        points. I had no notion of buddhas as buddhas. I had no notion of myself as myself. I had no notion of the prophecy as
                        prophecy. Sāgaramati, such is a bodhisattva’s prophecy in terms of the purity of the three spheres. The lack of notions of a
                        buddha, oneself, and a prophecy is called the purity of the three spheres. <ref cRef="F.81.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-001-3168"/>

                        Moreover, the purity of the three spheres refers to no clinging to names, forms, or reference points. Moreover, the purity of
                        the three spheres is knowing the exhaustion of the past, the non-arrival of the future, and the non-existence of the present.
                        Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is knowing the body to be like a reflection, speech to be like an echo, and mind to
                        be like an illusion. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is the realization that the aggregates are the same as the
                        Dharma aggregate, that the elements are the same as the realm of phenomena, and that the sense sources are like an empty
                        village. Moreover, the purity of the three spheres is trust in emptiness, confidence in signlessness, and certainty in
                        wishlessness. Sāgaramati, the purity of the three spheres will purify all phenomena. Thus, Sāgaramati, bodhisattvas must

                        that they formed in the past continues to have an effect. For that, Sāgaramati, here are some analogies for you to consider,
                        since it is through analogies that some learned people understand what is meant.</p>

                        the water will flow along the channels that he has dug. The fields will be irrigated with water without him needing to exert
                        himself or focus on the task. Sāgaramati, likewise, even when bodhisattvas are not resting in equipoise, they dedicate their
                        roots of virtue to the mindstreams of all beings. Then, in accordance with how things are, those roots of virtue are also
                        skillfully dedicated toward the qualities of buddhahood. Moreover, as they rest in equipoise in order to purify their minds
                        and guard their discipline, they again dedicate their roots of virtue toward the qualities of buddhahood. It is because they

                        virtue, have pliant minds, have undistracted mindfulness, are free from the Lesser Vehicle, and have made aspirations toward
                        the Great Vehicle, they can arise from equilibrium and they will in all cases dedicate their roots of virtue to
                        omniscience.</p>

                        distracted. They dedicate all roots of virtue to omniscience spontaneously and without effort. By dedicating, those who have
                        become skilled in means do not fall prey to other vehicles and it makes no difference whether they are in equipoise or not. It

                        your training, sublime being. Bodhisattvas should not be verbose and obsessed with the use of words; rather, they should

                        liberate those who have not yet been liberated, offer relief to those who have not found relief, and bring to parinirvāṇa

                        follow an unwholesome companion who pretends to be a spiritual friend. Following such a one, they will lose interest in the
                        means of attracting disciples, ripening beings, upholding the sublime Dharma, and the accumulation of merit. They will train
                        in solitude with few pursuits and voluntary poverty. They will attend to, follow, and serve those who usually teach the
                        doctrines of the hearers and solitary buddhas rather than those of the Great Vehicle. When such bodhisattvas stay in solitude,
                        they may give up the Great Vehicle. The bodhisattva may then think, ‘I should surely offer advice.’ Yet they proffer corrupt
                        advice. When bodhisattvas proffer corrupt advice, they will advise others to live in solitude and adopt patience that makes
                        use of signs and characteristics. They do not prescribe genuine and perfect bodhisattva work. What then is genuine and perfect
                        bodhisattva work? Blessed One, genuine and perfect bodhisattva work consists of these ten things: (1) Basing oneself on the
                        roots of faith and attending to, relying upon, and serving spiritual friends. (2) Seeking the virtuous Dharma as if one’s head
                        and clothes were on fire. (3) Firm interest in the virtuous Dharma and not giving up right effort. (4) Acting carefully and
                        not wasting what one does. (5) Seeking to constantly ripen beings without being attached to one’s own happiness. (6) Upholding
                        the Dharma without consideration for life or limb. (7) Being insatiable in seeking out accumulations of merit in order to
                        purify buddha realms <ref cRef="F.103.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-001-3211"/> and obtain the major and minor marks of
                        excellence. (8) Seeking the accumulation of wisdom in order to attain <term>recollection</term> and eloquence. (9) Cultivating
                        the perfection of insight so that one is not stained by the state of all ordinary beings. (10) Seeking skill in means so that
                        one may transcend the deeds of hearers and solitary buddhas. Blessed One, these ten constitute genuine and perfect bodhisattva
                        work. However, they will not teach these things that bodhisattvas are to train in. In this regard it is said that awakening is
                        for bodhisattvas who strive with diligence, but not for the lazy. If after eight or ten eons one still has not fully awakened
                        to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood, one might think that one is unable to fully awaken to unsurpassed and perfect
                        buddhahood. However, Blessed One, if a bodhisattva is hoping to attain the fruition through procrastination, then this is the
                        tenth hook of Māra, related to bodhisattvas pretending to be spiritual friends.</p>

                        of awakening and set about trying to obstruct the bodhisattva. However, being unable to dissuade him, they were filled with
                        shame and so touched the feet of that blessed one. As they gave rise to the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening
                        from the bottom of their hearts, he then taught them the Dharma, after which he attained awakening. Thus, this thus-gone one
                        is called Mārapramardaka. <ref cRef="F.106.b" type="folio" xml:id="UT22084-058-001-3218"/> Moreover, in the supreme and
                        excellent group that attained awakening were also bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras. Even those who
                        served him were bodhisattvas who had been converted from among the māras. The blessed thus-gone Mārapramardaka solely taught
                        the bodhisattva teachings. The name of any other vehicle was not even heard of. Venerable Śāradvatīputra, this is what the
                        world Adorned with Every Pleasure is like. So, if they were sent there, these māras could no longer function.” </p>

                        of them possessed all the power of mindfulness and <term>recollection</term> that the monk Ānanda possesses. Even then, they
                        still would not equal even a fraction of the power of mindfulness and <term>recollection</term> produced by the bodhisattva
                        Sāgaramati. No analogy could ever describe it. Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva Sāgaramati retains the teachings of all the blessed
                        buddhas of the ten directions. When one thus-gone one teaches the Dharma, it does not lessen or increase the Dharma teaching
                        of a second thus-gone one. Kāśyapa, I will draw an analogy: A rain the depth of a chariot axle could fall upon the great
                        ocean, but one body of water will not lessen or increase a second body of water. Even though the ocean absorbs all the flow of
                        all rivers, it does not grow or shrink. Kāśyapa, likewise, though the bodhisattva Sāgaramati retains the Dharma teaching of
                        all the blessed buddhas, the Dharma teaching of one thus-gone one does not lessen or increase the Dharma teaching of a second
                        thus-gone one. There is no increase or decrease to the strength of recollection he has aroused.”</p>

                            <term type="definition">A person who is eight steps away in the arc of their development from becoming an arhat (Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">dgra bcom pa</foreign>). Specifically, this term refers to one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">śrotāpanna</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rgyun du zhugs pa</foreign>), and is the first and lowest stage in a list of eight stages or classes of a noble person (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āryapudgala</foreign>). The person at this lowest stage in the sequence is still on the path of seeing (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">darśanamārga</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mthong lam</foreign>), and then enters the path of cultivation (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bhāvanāmārga</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sgoms lam</foreign>) upon attaining the next stage, that of a stream-enterer (stage 7). From there they progress through the remaining stages of the śrāvaka path, becoming in turn a once-returner (stages six and five), a non-returner (stages four and three), and an arhat (stages two and one). This same “eighth stage” also appears in set of ten stages (Skt. <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">daśabhūmi</foreign>; Tib. <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sa bcu</foreign>) found in Mahāyāna sources, where it is the third step out of the ten. Not to be confused with the ten stages of the bodhisattva’s path, these ten stages mark the progress of one who sequentially follows the paths of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and then bodhisattva on their way to complete buddhahood. In this set of ten stages a person “on the eighth stage” is similarly one who is on the cusp of becoming a stream-enterer.</term>
