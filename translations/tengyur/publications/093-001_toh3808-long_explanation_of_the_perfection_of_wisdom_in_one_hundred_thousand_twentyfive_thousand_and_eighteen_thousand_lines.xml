                            out, and completed, respectively. They lay down the burden of aggregates

                            by actualizing cessation. There, they gain the happiness where there are
                            no aggregates by forsaking the burden of aggregates; they gain the

                            these secret mantra bases mean, what are the actual meanings of the
                            expression and what’s expressed?” After thus contemplating for a long
                            time they see no meaning in what is being expressed. Seeing no meaning,
                            they ascertain perfectly, “There is no meaning at all being expressed
                            <ref cRef="F.9.a" type="folio" xml:id="UT23703-093-001-416"/> in those secret mantra bases. It is certain that just the
                            absence of an expressed meaning is the meaning of those secret mantra
                            bases. The intrinsic absence of an expressed meaning is their meaning.”
                            They meditate on those secret mantra bases as free from essential
                            expression and expressed. Having meditated well on those secret mantra
                            bases free from expression and expressed, they perfectly ascertain that
                            in the same fashion all dharmas are free from essential expression and
                            expressed. They think, “Just as these secret mantra bases are free from
                            essential expression and expressed, all dharmas are similarly
                            inexpressible, so their basic nature is inexpressible.” Thus, they
                            determine that all dharmas, in their basic nature free from essential
                            expression and expressed, are by nature inexpressible. When they have
                            determined that, they see that all dharmas are empty of a falsely
                            imagined nature. When they see that, they realize the essential
                            inexpressible nature of all dharmas, on account of which a great joy
                            arises. They then, because of that, are those who have “acquired the
                            dhāraṇi.” Then just because of acquiring the dhāraṇīs, with that as
                            cause, there immediately comes into being for the bodhisattva a great
                            forbearance in harmony with the production of the first Pramuditā level,
                            a forbearance so-called because it is able to bear the ultimate. Such a
                            forbearance, when it arises, is “dhāraṇī knowledge.” Not long after they
                            have produced that dhāraṇī forbearance they reach “the Pramuditā level
                            of those with surpassing aspiration.” Therefore, you should know that
                            this dhāraṇī forbearance is included in the belief course of conduct
                            level. </p>
